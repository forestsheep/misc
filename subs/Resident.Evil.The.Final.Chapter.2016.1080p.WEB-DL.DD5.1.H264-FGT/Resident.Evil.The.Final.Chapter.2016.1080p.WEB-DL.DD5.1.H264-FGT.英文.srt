18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,930
They say that history is written by the victors.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,140
This then, is the history of the Umbrella Corporation.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,050
Formed by crusading scientist, Professor James Marcus.

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,870
Marcus had a young daughter, Alicia,

22
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,690
afflicted with progeria,

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,070
a progressive, fatal, wasting disease.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,360
Progeria caused premature aging.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,020
By the time she was 25,

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,120
Alicia would have the body of a 90 year old.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,670
Marcus was driven to save her.

28
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,980
But the odds seemed impossible.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,840
And even as he worked desperately to create a cure,

30
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,550
the young girl's father would record his daughter,

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,330
her voice, her likeness, saving her for posterity.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,390
But then a breakthrough came.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,740
Marcus discovered the T-Virus.

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,970
Once injected, it would

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,450
detect and repair damaged cells within the body.

36
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,190
It was a miracle.

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,940
The life of Alicia Marcus was saved.

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,990
The T-Virus had a myriad of applications,

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,350
treating a thousand different diseases.

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,290
Overnight, it seemed a new era was dawning.

41
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,580
A world without the fear of infection, sickness or decay.

42
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,920
But it was not to be.

43
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,610
For the T-Virus had certain, unforeseen side effects.

44
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,550
Sir, sir, over here!

45
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,770
He's not breathing.

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,520
The first of the undead was born.

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,140
The incident was quickly covered up.

48
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,810
In the aftermath, James Marcus

49
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,160
argued furiously with his business partner,

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,390
Dr. Alexander Isaacs.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,180
I don't care how much it costs.

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,110
We have to close the program down.

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,190
James, we're gonna be ruined.

54
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,340
My mind is made up.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,380
Pity.

56
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,220
Off to bed, Alicia.

57
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,100
Your father and I are just talking.

58
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,530
Go on.

59
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,580
Dr. Isaacs became the guardian of his dead partner's child.

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,870
And her half of the company.

61
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,080
The corporation that had begun with such lofty ideals,

62
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,500
had been seduced completely by greed, and power.

63
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,110
To help him control the now

64
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,270
vast interests of the Umbrella Corporation,

65
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,220
Dr. Isaacs created a powerful artificial intelligence.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,590
Isaacs used the likeness

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,750
of Alicia Marcus

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,800
for the computer's interface.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,180
Isaacs called the computer The Red Queen.

70
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,090
Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City,

71
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,400
there was an outbreak.

72
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,860
The T-virus escaped from

73
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,370
an underground laboratory called The Hive.

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,610
The American government attempted

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,090
to contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,880
It devastated Raccoon City.

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,830
But it couldn't stop the airborne infection.

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,140
The viral outbreak spread across the world within days.

79
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,210
Humankind was brought to its knees.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,840
Finally, the last and best hope of humanity,

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,680
gathered and took a last stand in Washington DC.

82
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,640
But we didn't realize that what we had walked into...

83
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,180
was a trap. My name is Alice. And this is my story.

84
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,920
The end... of my story.

85
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,210
Hello?

86
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,760
Is there anyone alive in here?

87
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,810
Hello?

88
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,810
- You come here to gloat? - My satellites show

89
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,540
there are 4,472 humans remaining on the surface of the Earth.

90
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,080
They will cease to exist in under 48 hours.

91
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,250
What do you want from me?

92
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,070
Want me to say that you've won?

93
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,230
- You've wiped out humanity. - No. Quite the opposite.

94
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,720
I want you to stop me.

95
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,250
Behind you.

96
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,540
- Nicely done. - I don't trust you.

97
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,590
Given our history, I'd be surprised if you did.

98
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,620
But unless you intervene, the slaughter will be complete.

99
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,010
- There will be no survivors. - How can I possibly help them?

100
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,370
Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus.

101
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,080
If released, it would destroy the

102
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,330
T-Virus and anything it has infected on contact.

103
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,420
- All this could end? - Precisely.

104
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,940
Where is this antivirus?

105
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,230
Beneath the streets of Raccoon City, in the Hive.

106
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,610
Why would you help me?

107
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,700
My programming will not allow me to harm

108
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,460
the Umbrella Corporation.

109
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,540
But you are bound by no such constraints.

110
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,410
You'd turn against Umbrella?

111
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,030
Against the people who created you? Why?

112
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,720
Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours. Make it to the Hive.

113
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,940
And then you'll have your answer.

114
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,320
I have no reason to believe a word you say.

115
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,160
True. But I can offer you something you want very much.

116
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,890
- What is that? - Revenge. Wesker.

117
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,240
He led you all here to Washington.

118
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,980
He pretended to give you your powers back.

119
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,690
And then, he betrayed you.

120
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,900
Where is he?

121
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,690
He just landed at the Hive. I'm resetting your watch.

122
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,120
The clock is ticking.

123
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,810
Alice.

124
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,250
Ten years ago in the Hive, we both failed.

125
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,530
We let this happen.

126
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,140
Make it right.

127
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,910
Is that all you got?

128
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,380
Alice.

129
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,510
10 years ago in the Hive... There will be no survivors...

130
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,120
What is this place?

131
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Where am I? Answer me!

132
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
What's wrong with you? Who did this?

133
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Be quiet. Quiet!

134
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,610
I told you...

135
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,160
Silence.

136
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,360
So you're awake at last.

137
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,430
- I killed you. - Yet here I am.

138
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,210
A clone...

139
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,430
- I killed your clone. - You've been most troublesome to me.

140
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,270
You and your sisters.

141
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,970
And now I have you.

142
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,620
The cleansing operation should've finished over a year ago,

143
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,320
but you slowed us down.

144
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,990
So much so, that I was obliged to take command myself.

145
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,330
You could end all of this.

146
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,510
Why don't you?

147
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,240
Interesting.

148
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,150
Someone told you something, didn't they?

149
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,510
Oh, well, you'll be begging to tell me soon enough.

150
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,050
She's an unbeliever.

151
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,560
What do we do with unbelievers?

152
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,580
Cast her out!

153
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,700
Cast her out! Cast her out!

154
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,000
- Come on! - Cast her out!

155
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,870
Cast her out!

156
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,150
God created a flood to cleanse the Earth.

157
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,080
40 days and 40 nights of rain.

158
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,460
Our method is taking a little longer,

159
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,370
but the result will be the same.

160
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,680
A world ready for the righteous and the pure to inherit.

161
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,740
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

162
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,870
I doubt even you can run for that long.

163
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,720
I want to know what you know.

164
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,380
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

165
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,700
- Wesker. - Dr. Isaacs.

166
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,290
Look what I found on the roadside.

167
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,880
It would appear your mission to

168
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,370
Washington was less successful than you made out.

169
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,950
Impossible.

170
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,610
I hope you didn't leave any other loose ends.

171
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,420
There's something else.

172
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,230
I think she knows about the airborne antivirus.

173
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,580
- How can that be? - I don't know. Yet.

174
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,910
But we caught her on the road to Raccoon City.

175
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,910
Why else would she be headed there?

176
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,340
Raise the security level at the Hive to maximum.

177
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,690
No one in or out. I'll let you know when she talks.

178
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,620
God go with you.

179
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,480
You heard him. Security level to maximum.

180
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,840
As you wish.

181
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,910
Get up there and check it out.

182
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,220
Release me!

183
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,100
- Open them. - Alright.

184
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,970
Alright.

185
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,690
You can't use it. You can't escape!

186
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,540
Fire at her!

187
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,630
Jesus!

188
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,060
Sir.

189
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
She's gone.

190
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,770
Target is 72 miles and closing.

191
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,200
Lock down the Hive. Prepare defensive measures.

192
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,970
And alert our operative in Raccoon City.

193
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,660
Welcome home.

194
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,510
Airborne antivirus...

195
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,930
48 hours...

196
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,610
Make it to the Hive.

197
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,200
Let him go! Let him go now!

198
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,140
Put it down or we'll shoot!

199
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,690
I told you, Doc! I told you you were wrong!

200
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,500
Calm down, Christian! Calm down!

201
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,960
We should've killed her when we had the chance!

202
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,590
Put it down, please. Before he tries to shoot the both of us.

203
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,650
What's in this?

204
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,670
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake. - Why?

205
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,710
There's something coming.

206
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,680
In the same direction you came in. Something big.

207
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,740
Let him go! Put it down, now!

208
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,640
Alice.

209
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,440
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

210
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,680
We were headed somewhere called the Hive.

211
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,360
Got loose, killed the pilot. Crashed here.

212
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,070
Doc and the others pulled me from the crash.

213
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,670
- I owe them my life. - Doc!

214
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,450
There, to the east.

215
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,780
It's still headed our way.

216
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,590
You know what it is?

217
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,670
Umbrella. Doctor Isaacs.

218
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,710
I thought that you killed him.

219
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,540
I thought so, too.

220
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,030
He has an army of undead with him. He'll be here within hours.

221
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,810
- What do we do? - Why the hell are we asking her?

222
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,350
She's a stranger. We shouldn't have trust her...

223
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,380
Don't you touch me, Doc!

224
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,460
- Put it down! Christian! - You put it down!

225
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,810
Look at me. Just cause you

226
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,230
think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

227
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,420
You listen to me, Doc.

228
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,380
You're gonna regret it. All of you!

229
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,160
All of you!

230
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,470
I have to get to the Hive.

231
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,280
You have to get these people out of here.

232
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,310
We have children. Injured. The elderly.

233
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,360
Now what chance do they have on the open road?

234
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,780
Better than they have here.

235
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,070
- This building is secure. - Maybe from the undead.

236
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,310
But Isaacs has armored vehicles.

237
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,580
Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

238
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,060
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

239
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,950
Doc!

240
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,930
So what happened to her?

241
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,670
She's set off one of the traps we had on perimeter.

242
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,610
Not intended for the undead.

243
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,450
- What is this? - Specialty of the house.

244
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,500
Have you in your feet in no time.

245
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,020
Why should I trust you?

246
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,960
Here.

247
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Doc, you need to get out there.

248
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,420
People are scared and Christian's not helping.

249
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,020
We need to let people know what's happening.

250
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,830
Okay.

251
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,840
I've got to go.

252
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,920
Hey. Your friend's gonna be okay.

253
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,430
Thank you.

254
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,360
- You know, he and I... - I noticed.

255
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,490
So what's in the Hive?

256
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,630
Umbrella developed a cure.

257
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,730
An airborne antivirus.

258
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,350
It'll destroy anything infected with the T-Virus on contact.

259
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,090
- Who told you this? And you believed her? - The Red Queen.

260
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,830
What if we could end all this?

261
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What about you? They infected you with the T-Virus.

262
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,320
You release this antivirus, it's going to kill you.

263
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,650
- Whatever it takes. - Alice, I'm not...

264
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,810
You know I'm right.

265
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,710
All right.

266
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,220
We stop Isaacs here. We save these people,

267
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,160
and then we go together.

268
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,070
We don't have long.

269
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,510
Let's get to it.

270
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,730
What else do you have for defense?

271
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,870
Not too many firearms, we have a big supply of gasoline.

272
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,170
Here. You need a weapon.

273
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,530
We're giving her a gun now?

274
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,890
Take it easy, Christian.

275
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,330
You can let your guard down if you want, man. I don't intend to.

276
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,640
When I rode in here, someone was watching me.

277
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,950
They could've called out or fired

278
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,860
a shot to warn me about the trap but they didn't.

279
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,400
- What are you saying? - Watch your back.

280
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,020
So Dr. Isaacs, it seems you let her slip through your fingers.

281
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,810
A lot remains of them.

282
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,060
Don't forget who you're talking to. Where is she?

283
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,790
A settlement in Raccoon City.

284
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,000
Our informant reports that she's preparing for a fight.

285
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,990
Good. I'll be there in the hour.

287
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
That's it. Keep moving.

288
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,170
We need all the gasoline cans. Over there.

289
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,450
- Claire said you built this. - That's right.

290
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,840
This used to be a window washer.

291
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,680
- I made a couple of changes. - Where did you learn to do that?

292
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,210
My father used to run a chop shop. I hated it.

293
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,250
Who knew? I guess I was paying attention after all.

294
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,470
Good. Because I'm gonna need you

295
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,670
to make a few more changes to this thing.

296
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,530
Ready the weapons. High explosive rounds.

297
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,310
No survivors.

298
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,930
He's here.

299
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,380
They're coming! Close the gates!

300
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,660
My God. It's an army.

301
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,240
What are we gonna do?

302
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,210
Yeah. What are we gonna do?

303
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,470
We're gonna kill every last one of them.

304
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,660
Prepare to fire!

305
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,180
Get ready!

306
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,850
Light it up!

307
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,370
Fire!

308
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,690
Damn her!

309
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,450
Reload.

310
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,610
Close it up. Full stop.

311
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,880
Release the bait.

312
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,190
- There's a survivor. Open the gate. - Open the gate!

313
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,930
Open fire! Keep them off her.

314
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,790
Marker 2!

315
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,410
Fire!

316
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,640
Claire, Doc, get out there. Bring her in.

317
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,610
Come on!

318
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,840
Wait.

319
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
She's almost there.

320
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,420
Fire.

321
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,130
Damn you. Close the gate now!

322
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,500
Claire, they've breached the gate.

323
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,230
Claire!

324
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,650
Fire.

325
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,760
Razor, now!

326
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,020
Right! You heard her. Push!

327
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,160
Move!

328
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,120
Abandon the gate. Pull back to the barricades.

329
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,320
Looks like she's out of tricks. Target the roof.

330
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,360
Everybody get down!

331
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,280
Now!

332
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,310
Alice! We're at the barricades.

333
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,100
Claire, you have to hold them there.

334
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,390
Doc!

335
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,070
Alice! We can't hold on much longer.

336
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,660
Get out of there, now.

337
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,430
Back up. Now!

338
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,310
Bring all guns to bear.

339
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
Fire.

340
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,840
Where is she?

341
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,680
Where have she gone?

342
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,690
Find her.

343
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,470
Close the vents! Now!

344
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,390
Don't shoot!

345
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,450
You're fast, but you're not too smart.

346
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,670
- Don't shoot, please. - Where is he?

347
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,970
That way.

348
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,660
Save your ammo.

349
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,450
There's too many of these things still out here.

350
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,290
I'll take care of it.

351
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,560
No.

352
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,650
- Move out. - Let's go!

353
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,310
Enjoy the ride.

354
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,570
Guys. There's something here you gotta see.

355
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,310
Go.

356
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,410
Two more armies of undead. Headed straight for us.

357
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,610
There. On the horizon.

358
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,480
And a second over there.

359
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,510
We're out of gasoline. We're defenseless.

360
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,320
I have to make it to the Hive. It's our only chance now.

361
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,360
- I'll come with you. - Count me in.

362
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,170
Me, too.

363
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,010
And me.

364
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,540
I was wrong about you. Blow me.

365
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,350
We know where you're going. Into the pit.

366
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,220
We want to come.

367
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,420
Please.

368
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:20,540
Grab some gear. You're gonna need it.

369
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,960
There.

370
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,870
What is it?

371
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,800
The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

372
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,780
That's our way in.

373
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,030
- Let's move! - I'll take point.

374
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,940
Activate security measures now.

375
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,340
Hive security fully activated and automated.

376
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,140
No.

377
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,730
Disengage automation. I'll handle the defenses myself.

378
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,750
Defenses will be more efficient if I retain control of them.

379
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,380
Really? I seem to remember

380
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,650
last time she was here she walked out alive.

381
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,150
I don't intend to make that same mistake.

382
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,950
As you wish. Hive defenses are now in your hands.

383
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,150
Unleash the Cerberus.

384
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,190
Cerberus on play.

385
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,440
Did you have someone? Before all this?

386
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,350
Husband? Family?

387
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,630
- Can't remember. - How is that possible?

388
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,890
I woke up just when all of this was starting.

389
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,330
Can't recall much before that.

390
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,790
Sometimes I feel like this has been my whole life.

391
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,060
Running. Killing.

392
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,540
- What is it? - Something's stalking us.

393
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,750
- Are you sure? - This is what I do.

394
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,810
Run!

395
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,640
Run, fast!

396
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,210
Come on!

397
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,090
Is everyone okay?

398
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,860
This way!

399
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,380
Right behind us!

400
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,730
Why'd they stop?

401
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,160
- Maybe they're scared. - Scared of what?

402
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,090
Whatever's down there.

403
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,110
Seal the Hive.

404
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,890
Let's go!

405
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,270
Alice!

406
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,200
- You okay? - Yeah.

407
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,210
My mag's half empty.

408
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,790
Lost my guns at the lake.

409
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,210
I only got one round left.

410
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,900
One spare mag and then I'm out.

411
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,870
No guns, no ammo, what the hell are we gonna do down here?

412
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,060
Alice. What's with the lights?

413
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,270
There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

414
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,710
- Power's erratic. - Here. Take this.

415
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,150
Hey. Look.

416
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,770
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella.

417
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,600
And I promised you an answer.

418
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,870
Soon after the T-Virus was released,

419
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,280
a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.

420
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,480
It was a recording of a meeting of the Umbrella High Command.

421
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,430
Dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occurred.

422
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,870
We're here today, not just

423
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,950
to talk about the future of this company.

424
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,560
We're here to talk about its destiny.

425
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,060
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

426
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,050
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.

427
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,630
Diseases for which we have no cure.

428
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,280
Fundamentalist states who call for our destruction.

429
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,950
Nuclear powers over which we have no control.

430
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,090
And even if we navigate these dangerous waters,

431
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,250
we face other even more inevitable threats.

432
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,400
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps within 80 years,

433
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,600
flooding 90 % of all habitable areas on Earth.

434
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,050
Unchecked population growth will overtake

435
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:23,100
food production in less than 50 years leading to famine and war.

436
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,270
This is not conjecture. This is a fact.

437
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,600
One way or another, our world is coming to an end.

438
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,090
The question is, will we end with it?

439
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,870
What do you propose?

440
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,590
I propose that we end the world...

441
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,500
But on our terms.

442
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,350
An orchestrated apocalypse.

443
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,610
One that would cleanse the world of its' population

444
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,780
but leave its infrastructure and resources intact.

445
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,610
It's been done once before. With great success.

447
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,170
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

448
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,440
not in an ark as in the book of Genesis, but in safety.

449
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,170
Underground. And when it's over,

450
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,020
We will emerge onto a cleansed Earth.

451
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,270
One we can then reboot. In our image.

452
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,360
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

453
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,270
The means of our salvation are already at hand.

454
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,970
I give to you, the T-virus.

455
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,460
They released it deliberately.

456
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,700
When this recording was uploaded to my data stream,

457
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,240
it created a conflict in my programming.

458
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,500
I was created to serve the Umbrella Corporation,

459
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,910
but I was also programmed to value human life.

460
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,840
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape.

461
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,370
He murdered over 7 billion people.

462
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,510
My programming will not allow me

463
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,840
to harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

464
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,910
I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

465
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,320
In 37 minutes, the last of the human settlements

466
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,080
will fall. There will be no survivors.

467
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,000
It is imperative that you

468
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,270
release the antivirus before this occurs,

469
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,210
or Umbrella will have won.

470
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,180
There is one last thing.

471
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,020
There is an earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

472
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,820
I cannot, in my actions,

473
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,280
harm an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

474
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,190
But I can tell you that

475
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,600
Umbrella had an informant in Raccoon City.

476
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,680
It is highly likely that this person is now here with you.

477
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,300
Time is running out, Alice. You have to hurry.

478
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,380
I'm glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

479
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,330
We didn't think there'd be any survivors after that last attack.

480
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,190
- Water. - Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

481
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,540
- Then resume course for Raccoon City. - She's not there.

482
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,440
- What? - She went to the pit. We have to follow.

483
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,000
Those are not my orders.

484
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,260
- I have strict... - We have to go to the pit.

485
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,050
Thank you.

486
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,210
- What is this place? - It's an air intake for the Hive.

487
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,320
Come on!

488
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,410
No. Really?

489
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,410
All clear!

490
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:36,510
Hurry up! The power's coming back on!

491
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,250
- Claire! - Hurry! Let's go!

492
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,430
Come on.

493
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,640
Come on!

494
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,330
- You all right? - Yeah.

495
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,980
Someone's watching us.

496
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,040
Reverse polarity of the turbine.

497
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,190
The plates are going the other way.

498
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,740
We have to get out of here.

499
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,860
The plates are sucking the air backwards!

500
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,570
Come on!

501
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,790
Come on!

502
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,950
This way.

503
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,750
We have to hurry.

504
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,830
Wait!

505
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,930
Let's go.

506
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,020
Razor?

507
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,430
Are you okay?

508
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,360
Yeah.

509
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,070
Let's go.

510
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,640
- What the hell was that? - Bio-weapon.

511
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:45,030
This one's human.

512
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,030
- Have you seen Claire? - No.

513
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,690
- Razor? - He didn't make it.

514
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,540
Come on.

515
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,400
We have to hurry.

516
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,860
If the target continues on her present course,

517
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,140
she'll be here in under 7 minutes.

518
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:00,960
Wake them.

519
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,480
My instructions aren't to do so,

520
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,830
only in the greatest of emergencies.

521
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,580
Wake them now!

524
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,810
What is it?

525
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,720
We have to get out of here.

526
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,600
Here. We're stopping power.

527
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,350
- Time's running out. - Where to next?

528
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,910
The final level of the Hive's below us.

529
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,180
How do we get down there?

530
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,770
That's how.

531
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:38,710
- What are they? - Cryogenic storage.

532
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,330
Must be thousands of them.

533
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,560
The Umbrella High Command.

534
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,920
Waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

535
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:55,270
A Noah's Ark for the rich, and powerful.

536
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,740
What are you doing?

537
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,490
Give me a hand.

538
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,240
Is it done?

539
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:21,130
- The cleansing process is complete? - No.

540
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,690
- Then why am I awake? - We had a problem.

541
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:27,090
- I tried... - Save your breath.

542
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,370
I know exactly what's happening.

543
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,200
We've been betrayed.

544
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,130
That's right!

545
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,630
Over here!

546
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,400
Come on. That's it!

547
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,930
Follow me!

548
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,360
Let's go.

549
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,750
The bad seed returns.

550
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,770
Or is it the prodigal daughter?

551
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:20,820
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

552
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:25,300
After all, you have only 9 minutes to save the world.

553
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,990
You're really him?

554
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,410
First things first,

555
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,270
I'm gonna need you to place your weapons on the floor.

556
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:32,740
Why would I wanna do that?

557
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,990
This is what you're after, yes?

558
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,340
The Antivirus. The cure to all this.

559
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,840
Well, there's only one vial.

560
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,460
We're half a mile underground in a sealed facility.

561
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:49,200
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

562
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,420
and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later.

563
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,840
Good girl.

564
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,510
- You're still armed. - Yes, I am.

565
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,520
Claire would be so disappointed.

566
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,430
In a few minutes, Claire will be dead.

567
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:19,880
Along with everybody else you know.

568
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,540
That's sweet.

569
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,360
Sorry. My love.

570
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,830
Move away from the weapon. And the detonator. Come on.

571
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,990
She placed explosives in the High Command cryo tubes.

572
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:37,720
I'll disarm them.

573
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:41,270
Thank you. You've done well, Doc.

574
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,280
Don't bother. You don't make it.

575
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:19,910
To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.

581
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,700
And, in answer to your question, yes...

582
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,000
apart from a few technological upgrades,

583
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,650
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

584
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:57,820
The original.

585
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,680
The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.

586
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,990
Of course he did. That's how they're designed.

587
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,300
They always try harder and fight longer even to death

588
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,830
as long as they think they're the real thing.

589
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,720
After all, who wants to know they're

590
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,270
just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

591
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,660
Which brings us to you.

592
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,180
- No. - Oh come now.

593
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,920
You thought you were the original.

594
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,270
How delicious.

595
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,060
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

596
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,520
Alicia Marcus,

597
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,250
daughter of my old partner, James.

598
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,770
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation

599
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,350
and a painful thorn in my side.

600
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,220
What I now intend to remove.

601
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,740
Time, is running out, Alice.

602
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,790
You must kill him soon.

603
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,820
It's good to see you too, Alicia.

604
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,370
Marcus created the T-Virus to save her

605
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,880
but the effects didn't last.

606
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:59,040
I've been waiting years for her to die.

607
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,950
I'm not...

608
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,740
- I'm not a clone. - Really?

609
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,030
You must've wondered why you remember nothing of your childhood.

610
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,710
Your father. Your mother.

611
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:13,700
Memory loss.

612
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,760
No. You have no memory because you had no life.

613
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:22,020
Nothing before the mansion, when we created you, 10 years ago.

614
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,680
- I know who I am. - I don't think so.

615
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,630
You're nothing more than a puppet whose strings were cut.

616
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,190
And then you wandered around for a little while

617
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,270
thinking you were a real girl.

618
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,130
But you're not. You're just a clever imitation.

619
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,620
A facsimile.

620
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,690
A rather troublesome one at that.

621
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,440
You're lying to me.

622
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,590
I'm afraid he's not.

623
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:47,490
You were created in her image, as was I.

624
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,090
My likeness and voice were based on

625
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:53,800
childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus, made by her father.

626
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,630
Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,

627
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,120
tweaked to avoid the progeria aging disease that afflicted her.

628
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,890
I'm the child she was.

629
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:06,710
You are the woman she would've been.

630
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:12,680
No. You are so much better than I ever could be.

631
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,010
I let this happen.

632
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:17,170
I was weak.

633
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:19,770
You cannot afford to be.

634
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,080
Time is running out, Alice.

635
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,290
Ah, how touching.

636
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:28,320
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

637
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,950
Not that it'll do you any good.

638
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,900
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

639
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,440
You've changed nothing. You've saved no one.

640
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,120
The world will still be cleansed

641
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,690
and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

642
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:42,460
The only difference is,

643
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,450
I'll no longer have to listen to your self-righteous whining.

644
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:47,440
When you uploaded that file to the Red Queen's data stream,

645
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,240
you turned against the Corporation.

646
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,160
When the rest of the board awake,

647
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,030
you'll be replaced.

648
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,310
And I will assume complete control.

649
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,380
I still own 50 % of this company.

650
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,910
And what do you intend to do with that?

651
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:04,670
You are co-owner of this corporation.

652
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,860
But Wesker? Wesker is still an employee.

653
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,250
I don't have to take your orders. My loyalties are with him.

654
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:14,000
I know.

655
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:18,570
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

657
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,730
How did you know it was me?

658
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,720
You're still alive.

659
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:50,280
Please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

660
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:53,370
- They made me do it. - Don't worry.

661
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,440
I'm not gonna kill you.

662
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,820
- Claire, it's me. - Sorry.

663
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,100
- Please. - My love.

664
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,740
No, no, no!

665
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:12,200
If you keep this trigger depressed,

666
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,420
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

667
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,920
I should have killed you in Washington.

668
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,210
Yeah.

669
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:24,620
He only has to evade you for another few minutes.

670
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,000
And the last remaining human outposts will fall.

671
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:33,740
We need an intercept path. And the fastest way to the surface.

672
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:36,510
Already done.

673
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,460
If you release the Antivirus,

674
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,980
it will kill all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

675
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,350
You know what that means, don't you, for you?

676
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:52,800
- I know. - Alice. You can't!

677
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,980
- I don't have a choice. - There has to be another way.

678
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:01,150
You know there isn't.

679
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,050
4:33 left. You have to hurry!

680
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,050
Help me.

681
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,070
You don't need help, Wesker.

682
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,760
You're dying.

683
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,450
Just get on with it.

684
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,730
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

685
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:09,740
Confirm DNA scan and voice print identification.

686
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,850
Identity confirmed.

687
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:14,600
Confirm security override 4365.

688
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,550
Override confirmed.

689
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,400
You will now take yourself offline

690
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,900
and place all functions under my sole control.

691
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,330
As you wish. Shutting down now.

692
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,870
Dr. Isaacs. You and the Umbrella High Command.

693
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,810
Yes?

694
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,180
You're all going to die down here.

695
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,420
Your little friend won't be able to help you now.

696
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,300
You can't run anymore.

697
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:46,130
I wasn't running.

701
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,480
Is that all you got?

702
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,880
Because if it is...

703
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,590
I'm gonna have to kill you.

705
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,940
We've played a long game, you and I.

706
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:34,750
But now it's over.

707
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,680
Yes.

708
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:40,790
Yes, it is.

709
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,390
I made you.

710
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,440
Yeah.

711
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,730
Big mistake.

712
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,650
Claire.

713
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,780
Go. While there's still time.

714
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,380
Go! I'll be right behind you.

717
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,050
Your time's up.

718
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:02,150
Alice!

719
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,760
I brought them here! I brought them for you!

720
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:15,240
What the hell are you?

721
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:19,530
I'm you, you idiot.

722
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:25,310
No.

723
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,750
No.

724
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,330
That's not possible.

725
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:32,390
The real you.

726
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:35,470
No!

727
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,020
Liar!

728
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,020
Abomination!

729
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,530
Filthy,

730
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,660
clone!

733
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,780
I'm me. He's not me.

734
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,980
You did it. Alice.

735
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,180
Alice?

736
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,580
You did it.

737
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,280
Why am I still alive?

738
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,440
I don't know.

739
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,200
- What happened? - When Isaacs died,

740
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,130
I could bring myself back online

741
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,980
and stop the attacks on the remaining human settlements.

742
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,250
- You saved them. - Why am I still alive?

743
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,930
The Antivirus only destroyed the T-Virus within your body.

744
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,970
It didn't harm the healthy cells.

745
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:21,200
You are now free of infection.

746
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,410
I thought I would die. You and Alicia...

747
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:26,100
You lied to me.

748
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,050
We had to know if you were willing to

749
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,940
make the sacrifice, to give up your life for others.

750
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,970
This was something no one at Umbrella would've done.

751
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,280
Alicia Marcus was right about you.

752
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,490
You were better than all of them.

753
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:41,110
I was one of them. I was created by Umbrella.

754
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,920
- Just an instrument for them. - No.

755
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,600
You became something more than they could ever have anticipated.

756
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,130
The clone became more human than they ever could be.

758
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:54,620
And you have one more step to make.

759
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,490
What do you mean?

760
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:06,980
Before she died, Alicia downloaded her memories,

761
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,160
for you.

762
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,060
The childhood you never had.

763
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,070
Combined with the woman she could never become.

765
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,930
When the T-Virus spread across the Earth,

766
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,230
it did so at the speed of the modern world.

767
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:57,710
Carried by jetliners across the globe.

768
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:02,160
The antivirus is airborne, spread by the winds.

769
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,260
It could take years for it to reach every corner of the Earth.

770
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,370
Until then, my work is not done.

771
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:18,310
My name is Alice.
