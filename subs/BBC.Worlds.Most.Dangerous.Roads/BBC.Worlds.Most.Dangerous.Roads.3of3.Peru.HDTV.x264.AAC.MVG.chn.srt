1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
我们的星球上遍布着50亿公里的道路
Five billion kilometres of roads
network our planet.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,000
我可不喜欢这边的悬崖，
300-400英尺的悬崖
I don't like the drop down
this side, 300-400 feet drop.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,480
那会立刻毙命。
Instant death then.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,680
然而交流和贸易的渴望意味着
Yet the desire to communicate
and trade means new routes

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,440
新路线正日渐开辟在险恶的地形上
are being forged through
increasingly challenging terrain.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,000
尽可能的接近那个地方。
我知道，但是我能搞定那个悬崖吗？
Keep as close as you can there.
I know, but am I OK with that drop?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
横渡北极苔原。
Across Arctic tundra.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,240
可见度为零的路途。
我们正在迷茫中行进。
Zero visibility on the pass.
We are mid-drift.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
翻过山口。
Over mountain passes.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,400
穿过丛林
不，走，佛格！走
Through jungle.
No! Go, Fogle! Go!

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,840
这些道路是跟大自然的一场持久战
These roads fight a
constant battle with nature.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,680
让我们使之平息吧。
Let's just calm it down.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
而他们真实的存在是人类
巧夺天工的证明。
But their very existence is
testament to man's ingenuity,

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,880
驾驭他们需要勇气和决心。
and driving them requires
courage and determination.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,160
啊！
Oh, ge... Woah!

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,640
探险家本佛格和喜剧演员修丹尼
组队征服这条横穿秘鲁的险路
Adventurer Ben Fogle and comedian
Hugh Dennis have teamed up to drive
the treacherous route across Peru,

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,880
从安第斯深入亚马逊腹地
from the Andes
into the very heart of the Amazon.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,080
在这传奇的8天之旅，
他们将领略到这条非凡之路的峻美
On this epic eight-day journey,
they will see the beauty and the
danger of this extraordinary road.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,280
他们的目标是到达秘鲁的中心
They are aiming to get to the
geographical centre of Peru.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,720
现在尽可能靠近那一边。
As close to that side
as you can, now.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,480
他们所选择的道路有着两人都
And the road they're taken has
some of the most extreme

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,560
前所未遇的极端行车条件
driving conditions either of them
have ever encountered.

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,400
小心点。小心点。
Careful, careful.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,880
他们需要稳定的手法才能顺利度过，
还需要坚定的意志。
To make it through, they will need
steady hands and nerves of steel

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,600
在世界上最危险的道路之一
on one of the world's
most dangerous roads.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,480
本和修的路途开始于海拨超过3000
米的地方，在秘鲁安第斯山
Ben and Hugh's journey begins
at over 3,000 metres above sea level
in the Peruvian Andes.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,600
那么，你紧张吗？
So, are you nervous
about this at all?

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,920
稍微紧张。我能确认一件事吗？
I'm slightly nervous about it.
Can I just check one thing?

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,880
你是第一次考过驾照吗？
Did you pass your
driving test first time?

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,360
不是第一次。
I didn't pass my
driving test first time.

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,720
有什么关系吗？好的。
你考过几次？
That matter? That's fine.
How many times did you take it?

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,240
7次，7次？7次？
Seven. Seven times? Seven?

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
我想这顺便使我成为更好的驾驶员
I like to think it makes me
a better driver, by the way.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,120
那很好。因为我从没通过。
That's fine, because
I've never passed one.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
7次！这让我感觉好多了...
Seven times!
That makes me feel so much better...

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,200
他们的路线长1000K,横渡秘鲁,
Their route runs for 1,000k across
Peru and will take them through

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,360
将使他们穿过各种各异的有挑战
性的不同地带.
three very different but
challenging types of terrain.

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,240
他们还得穿过安第斯山,在秘鲁最
高的道路之一之上
They have to cross the Andes
on one of Peru's highest roads,

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,520
在驶向亚马孙雨林之前
before heading down into
the Amazon Rainforest.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,600
在那之后,去波苏索的镇上有500公里
的艰苦丛林路
After that,
it's 500 kilometres of rough
jungle roads to the town of Pozuzo.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
最终,他们需要穿过卡班巴大峡谷
Finally, they will have to make it
across the mighty Huancabamba Canyon

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,760
再沿着几英里的泥巴路达到秘鲁
中心
and along miles of mud roads
to reach the centre of Peru.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,840
他们希望在这儿找到康斯提图松,
1980年代一个打算替代利马的城市
Here they hope to find Constitucion,
a city which in the 1980s was
intended to replace Lima

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,440
作为秘鲁的新首都.但是今天
甚至在地图上消失
as Peru's new capital but today
doesn't even appear on the map.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,240
但是他们的冒险始于在康塞城的
秘鲁的安第斯山的大门
But their adventure begins at
the gateway to the Peruvian Andes
in the town of Concepcion.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,600
这是当地人进山的路的起点
This is where local people come
to start their journey into

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,320
这儿的出租车司机知道回去的路
the mountains and the taxi drivers
here know this route backwards.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,160
本发现跟他们有使用他那发霉
的西班牙语的机会
Ben sees an opportunity to try
out his rusty Spanish on them.

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,760
（西班牙语）（打招呼）
Hola. Mi nombre es Ben.

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,880
我们在我们车上
Somos en nuestro coche.
We're in our car.

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,080
Que bueno, que bueno.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,480
之间的路怎么样？
Digame, que tal es la carratera? How
is the road between here and there?

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,160
他说路很危险有很多...
So he's saying the roads are very
dangerous and there's lots of...

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
灰尘
Polvo is dust.

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,800
灰尘扬起,你什么也看不见.
有大的山崖吗?
It comes up and you can't see
anything. Are there big drops?

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,360
哦!500到1000米的悬崖.
Ooh! 500 to 1,000 metre drops.

57
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,720
康塞城?不,康士城
Concepcion? No, Constitucion.

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,280
司机们似乎不太了解康城这个城市
The drivers don't seem to know
much about the city of Constitucion,

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,480
除了知道它在丛林中的某个地方
except that it's
somewhere in the jungle.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,720
那么我们没事吗?
So will we be OK?

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
他说最大的危险是其他司机,
He said the biggest danger
is other drivers, and he said

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
我们必须在转弯非常,非常小心
said we have to be very, very
careful on all the corners.

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,200
再加上,我们不得不担心你.
我也不得不担心自己
Plus we have to worry about you.
And I have to worry about me.

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,600
谢谢
Gracias, senor. Gracias.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,640
再见
Hasta luego.

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,280
好的，我们上路啦
OK, let's hit the road.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,720
了解了当地路况，
他们迅速出发。
Armed with local knowledge,
they're aiming for a quick getaway.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,760
但是这条路暂时关闭
But the road has been
temporarily closed.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,480
我发现令人惊奇的是我们
不知身在何处
I find it amazing
we're in the middle of nowhere

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
我们偶遇了最大
从没见过的铜管乐队比赛
太神奇了，是不是？
and we've come across the biggest
brass-band competition I've
ever seen. It's amazing, isn't it?

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
我以为我从不会见到一只铜管乐队
I don't think I've ever
seen a brass-band competition.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,200
你之前从哪儿见过？
Where have you seen one before?

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,320
你以前见过吗？
Have you ever seen one?

74
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,000
35之乐队，来自全秘鲁
在道路解封之前，游行走过城镇
35 bands from all over Peru
will parade through town today
before the road re-opens.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
你觉得这是件很酷的是吗？
你是小孩吗？
You think this is a cool thing
to do, then? If you're a kid?

76
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,880
你认为管选乐队有小孩吗？
Do you think the cool kids
are in the brass band?

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,520
你会觉得这一切很傻吗？
Would you think it's all the dweebs?

78
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,160
我不知道，我觉得很酷
I don't know. I think it's cool.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,000
是吗？是的。
Do you? Yeah.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,880
如果我在那儿，我也会在乐队里
If I was out here,
I'd be in a brass band.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,920
你认为我们现在该不该从这个地方
出去？
Do you think we'll ever actually
get out of this place now?

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,760
好的，来了更多的。
Well, there are more coming.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,320
那是我的最爱。
That lot are my favourite.

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,480
我认为他们要赢了
I think they're going to win.

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,520
我们该回车上了吧？
Shall we head back to the car?

86
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,960
我们能出来吗？我认我我们应该
走这条路
Can we get out, do you think?
I think we should go this way.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,640
出发之后，蜿蜒的道路升入世界第二的山脉
安第斯山
After Conception, the road quickly
rises up into the Andes - the second
highest mountain range in the world.

88
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,080
从山上到亚马逊的路线是由
方济会的修道士们约500年前绘制的
This route over the mountains and
into the Amazon was mapped out by

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,000
Franciscan monks
almost 500 years ago

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,240
在他们探寻并教化土著部落皈依的时候
as they searched for indigenous
tribes to convert to Christianity.

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,920
我们上了4500米了现在，
在阿尔卑斯那几乎是蒙特白的顶部了
We're about 4,500 metres up now,
so in Alps terms that's
almost the top of Mont Blanc.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
今天，庞大的无峰驼群和羊驼群
漫游在这片区域。
Today, huge herds of llama
and alpaca roam this area,

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
躲开他们将成为小伙子们的第一个
挑战。
and avoiding them is going to
be the boys' first challenge.

94
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
我们走了。
Here we go.

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,000
哦...劳驾.劳驾
Oh... Woah.. Excuse us. Excuse us!

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,360
嘿.好家伙.
这个避开了路.
Hey, chaps.
That one's getting out of the way.

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,840
这个没有.
你以前见过羊驼吗?
This one isn't.
Have you seen an alpaca before?

98
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
是的.他们真酷.
Yeah. They're pretty cool.

99
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
我一直想成为一个牧羊人来着
I've always wanted to
be an alpaca farmer.

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
好的.你会的.你可以在英格了
干,是不是?
Well, you could. You can do
that in England, can't you?

101
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,000
尽管跟在安第斯这儿十分不同,是吗?
It's not quite the same as
here in the Andes though, is it?

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,960
几年来我很有幸的来过秘鲁几次
I've been lucky enough
to come to Peru a couple
of times over the years.

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,600
我大约18的时候,刚毕业,来过.
所以这是我获得学习经历的地方
I came here when I was about 18
and fresh out of school, so this is
where I had my learning experience.

104
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:39,440
这是我发现自我的地方,对于我来说,
这是我所热爱和感到非常振奋的地方
It's where I found myself, as such.
So, for me, it's somewhere I really
love and I get very excited by still.

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,040
受到他第一次秘鲁之旅的启发,
本在拉美攻读了一个学位.
Inspired by his first trip to Peru,
Ben took a degree in Latin American

106
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,240
作为一个职业探险家,学习,往返
南美很多次
studies and has since returned
to South America many times
as a professional adventurer.

107
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
Is that a road?
那是一条路吗?

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,840
向上去的那是一条路吗?
Is that thing a road going up there?

109
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,880
一定是.蜿蜒曲折,,,我不知道我们是不是
这么上去.
It must be.
With the switchbacks... I don't know
if that's what we're going up.

110
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,000
看上去是条荒路,是吗?
It looks very off-road, doesn't it?

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
见鬼!
Bloody hell.

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,120
我从没去过拉美
我从没去过南美
I've never been to Latin America.
I've never been to South America.

113
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
我去过所有的大洲,除了那儿.
I've been to all the other
continents but I've never been here.

114
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
我很高兴做这件事。
I'm so pleased I'm doing it.

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,480
这是一个美妙的旅程。
This is a fantastic journey.

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,640
这个旅程将使得修的游客历程
比以前更深一步，
It's a journey that will take
Hugh further off the tourist
trail than he's ever been before.

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,320
科马斯城建成于超过2000年前
The town of Comas was established
over 2,000 years ago.

118
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,160
但是第一辆机动车在1930年代才出现
在这里，当道路工人
But the first vehicles only appeared
here in the 1930s, when road crews

119
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,480
终于围绕着村子凿通了山路
finally blasted through the
mountains surrounding the village.

120
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,840
这是最后的机会，在进丛林之前，
It's the last chance before
the jungle for drivers to check

121
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,760
由当地的机械师，瑞，来检查一下
轮胎能否胜任过擦。
that their tyres are up to scratch
with local mechanic, Rui Cardenas.

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
(西语）
Hola.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
(西语）
Mi nombre es Ben. Gusto, gusto.

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,280
我想说，我们不太了解轮胎，
这个公平吗？你了解吗？
I'm going to say...
Is it fair for me to say we don't
know much about tyres? Do you?

125
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,720
我是不是自以为是？
Am I being presumptuous there?

126
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,360
没有，说的很坦白。
No, it'd be fair to say.

127
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,040
他说西班牙语
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

128
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,720
我就是说，如果出现了一个小孔，
我们又没有空余的内胎什么的咋办
I'm just saying what happens if
there's a hole and we don't have
spare inner tubes or anything.

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,840
哦，你就把轮胎里面垫草
Wow, you're thatching
the inside of a tyre.

130
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,640
所以他说最好用树叶什么的
So he's saying the best thing
is to use leaves and things.

131
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,640
在我看来，这真的是大黄叶柄
最好的用途。
This would be, in my opinion,
the very best use for rhubarb.

132
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,360
他说我们实际上同样可以把衣服
放进去。
So he's saying we can actually
put our clothes in here as well.

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
你的夹克。
用你的衣服。
Your jacket. Use your clothes!

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
他说，我们可以借用这个。
He's saying we can borrow his.

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,280
我们在这一步还不需要把你填满
We don't need to stuff you
in there at this stage.

136
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,960
他们真实应有尽有，是不是？
我想那是你该做的。
They're so resourceful out here,
aren't they?
I suppose that's what you have to do.

137
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
你需要能用的都用上
You have to just make do
with what you have.

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,000
(西语）
Y cuantos? Mucha mucha?

139
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,920
直到它相当得牢固。
Until it's pretty solid.

140
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,960
你认为这会通过英国的MOT吗？
Do you think that'd pass
the MOT in England?

141
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
这让你好奇为什么还要麻烦的充满气
It makes you wonder why
they bother to fill them with air.

142
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,760
大概他说的是，没有外国人这么疯狂
的来走这条路
Roughly what he was saying there
are that no foreigners are
crazy enough to come on this road.

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
在他们的教训结束的时候，一天快结束了
At the end of their lesson
the day is nearly over,

144
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,520
这条路的下一步，太危险了，
以至于不能在黑夜行车。
the next stage of the road is too
dangerous to drive in the dark.

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,720
所以他们不得不在科马斯过夜
So they have to spend
the night in Comas.

146
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,480
他们的路边旅馆是餐馆的2倍
Their roadside hotel
doubles up as a restaurant

147
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,760
为每天来往这条线路的人提供餐宿
to feed and house the people
who drive this route every day.

148
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,960
今天，菜单上只有一道菜
Today, there is
only one dish on the menu.

149
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,480
我不介意一天吃的饭菜，在英国时，
而且你大概会知道你会遇到的情况
I don't mind eating the dish of the
day when I'm in England and you know
roughly what you're going to get.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,080
(西语）
Buenas noches. Que tal?

151
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
(西语）谢谢
Gracias.

152
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,320
看看前头
Have a look at the head area.

153
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,120
那是头，，，
That's a guinea pig.

154
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,720
那是头，，，
That's a guinea pig.

155
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,480
牙齿，排骨
Teeth, ribs...

156
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
那是他的心脏吗？
Is that its heart?

157
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,160
我认为他们叫它QUIQUI
Qui qui I think is what they call it.

158
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,560
如果没人告诉你那是什么，
我觉得你可能认为那是鸡
If nobody told you what
that was, I think you'd
just think that was chicken.

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,280
很明显那是什么。
It's fairly obvious what it is.

160
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,720
所缺少的唯一的线索是它不是
装在笼子里。
The only clue it's missing
is that it's not in a hutch.

161
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,280
我们在开吃这种天竺鼠（几内亚猪）的玩笑，
可是这是一种他们在外就餐所吃的
We're joking about eating
guinea pig but this is
kind of what they eat out here.

162
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,760
我总是敏感的避免嘲笑别人的文化
和饮食。
·I always feel sensitive about not
wanting to laugh at other people's
cultures and what they eat.

163
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,960
不，绝对没有什么不好。
他们在卧室里养
No, no that's absolutely fine.
They keep them in their bedrooms.

164
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,520
就是那种睡觉的大卧室，
天竺鼠（几内亚猪）谁在床底下，
也许有60只
Like the long rooms they sleep in,
the guinea pigs, maybe up to 60,
sleep under the bed

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,280
并且用处很多，像个加热器似的，
它们整晚的到处活动
and multipurpose, like a heater,
they move around all night

166
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,080
他们制造的热量贯穿床板，
保持暖和
and the heat they make goes up
through the bed, keeps them warm

167
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,800
然后，他们吃它们做早餐，
我很小的时候就吃过天竺鼠（几内亚猪）
and then they eat them for breakfast.
I had guinea pigs when I was

168
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,280
我记得，他们也互相吞噬。
a child, and as I remember,
they ate each other.

169
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,320
本和修已经完成了他们旅程的
第一阶段。
Ben and Hugh have completed
the first stage of their journey,

170
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,880
但是他们一直以来享受到的柏油碎石
路面在科马斯戛然而止。
but the tarmac road they've enjoyed
so far ends abruptly in Comas.

171
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,480
现在他们得行驶150公里的没铺过
的山路来翻越安第斯，
Now they have to drive
150 kilometres over the Andes

172
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,120
然后驶向塞提波的丛林城镇。
on an unpaved mountain road,
and then down to
the jungle town of Satipo.

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,160
单行的科马斯之路伸向超过4500米的高度
The single-track
Comas road reaches heights
of over 4,500 metres.

174
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,400
综合了发髻一般的弯道和险峻陡峭
的悬崖，使得这段路成了南美最具
挑战性的险路之一
Its hairpin bends and
sheer drops combine to

175
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,560
make it one of the most challenging
drives anywhere in South America.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,120
看呀
Look.

177
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
那一定是我们要找的路。
That must be our road.

178
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,760
那是我们要走的路。
不可思议。
That is our road.
That is unbelievable.

179
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,640
太奇妙了。
你们是怎么建造出那样的路的？
This is fantastic.
How do you build a road like that?

180
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,880
非同凡响
It's just extraordinary.

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
哇。
就是一条非常险峻的悬崖在那儿。
Wow.
It's quite a steep drop just here.

182
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
是的，我看见了
Yep, I saw that.

183
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,160
我在提醒这一点
I was aware of that.

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,160
科马斯之路在整个40年代由庞大的劳力
施工队在山腰里雕刻出来。

The Comas road was carved out of the
mountainside by huge gangs of manual
labourers throughout the 1940s.

185
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,680
工程师们遵从的草图是早在百多年前
的传教士们设计的
Its engineers followed the track
charted by the missionaries
centuries earlier.

186
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,040
悬崖到下面的山谷超过1000米。
With drops of over 1,000 metres
to the valley below,

187
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,320
哪怕一点小小的误差都会导致灾难
even the smallest miscalculation
can lead to disaster.

188
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,080
你在那儿看见过山崩吗？
Do you see the landslide there?

189
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
不要太企盼这个，因为这儿还会有
Don't be looking at it too much,
because this is also here.

190
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,200
看，从那儿下去就是谷底也是你
生命的结束
Look, down there is
the bottom of the valley
and also the end of your life.

191
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,520
看这条上去的路
Look at the road going up.

192
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,200
要想从科马斯之路生还，你需要
对此稀有景观闭上一只眼。
And to survive on the Comas road,
it also pays to keep an eye
on the rear-view mirror.

193
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,760
OK，我们后边来了辆巴士
OK, we've got a bus behind us.

194
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,280
我不想乘坐巴士
I would not want to be in a bus.
Would you?

195
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,960
好的，乘巴士的情况是，你的命运
掌握在了一个你一无所知的司机手上
Well, the thing is about a bus
is that you're in the hands of some
driver you know nothing about.

196
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,560
哦，那跟我们很相像
Oh, that's like us!

197
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,640
的确如此
Exactly.

198
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
他也比你走的快
He's also going faster than you.

199
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,160
喇叭声
HORN SOUNDS

200
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,920
他在冲我鸣笛
He honked at me!

201
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,960
旁边就是1000英尺的悬崖什么的
With 1,000-foot drop,
or whatever that is, next to me.

202
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,240
我们让他们超车吗？
Do we let him pass us?

203
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
在继续走一点，是吗？
Keep going for a bit. Shall we?

204
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,400
是的，见鬼。
Yeah. Bloody hell.

205
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,040
我们就然他们从这儿过吧。
We'll just let him go here.

206
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,760
那么，继续。
Go on, then.

207
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,840
这也可能是它的一个站
This might be one of his stops.

208
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,080
好的
That's fine.

209
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,400
你认为我们，，，不。
Do you think we copped out there? No.

210
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,440
大多数重大事故都是和其他机动车
摆脱不了干系的
Most fatal accidents here
involve other vehicles.

211
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,960
路边的神龛表示了最危险的
转弯
Roadside shrines mark the
most dangerous corners,

212
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,800
司机和乘客所掉落悬崖的地方
where drivers and their passengers
have gone over the edge.

213
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,280
所以，我估计那些神龛之所以在那儿
So, I reckon those
shrines are there because

214
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,520
是因为他们曾经误判过转弯，不是吗
they'll just have misjudged
that bend, won't they?

215
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
哇
Wow.

216
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,480
你估计有多远？
How far down do you reckon that is?

217
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,560
哦，我们在1000，1200英尺处？够远了
Well, we're level with 1,000 feet...
12,000 feet? Far enough.

218
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,840
实际上有点恐怖
It's a bit scary actually.

219
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,840
你真的需要对这条路闭上眼，
什么都不想
You really do need to keep
your eyes on the road and
you don't think about that.

220
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,880
哦，我猜想那就是这里所发生过的事
Well, I'm assuming that's
what's happened here.

221
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,120
一辆车误判了转弯
A car has misjudged that bend.

222
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,880
稍微冷静点了，是吗？
Slightly sobering, isn't it?

223
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,000
真不是个令人愉快的念头
Not really a pleasant thought.

224
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,720
山崩的威胁是当下存在的危险
The threat of landslides
is an ever-present danger

225
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,200
在科马斯之路上
on the Comas road.

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,160
上百的立体方石可能从山腰横扫而至
Hundreds of cubic tonnes
of loose rock can

227
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,880
冲毁路经的一切
sweep down from the mountainside,
destroying everything in its path.

228
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,760
修路队为了使得道路开放使用进行
着一场持久战
Maintenance teams fight a constant
battle to keep the road open,

229
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,880
总会有个修路小队在路上的什么
地方随时行动
and there is always a team in
action somewhere on the road.

230
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,440
OK,所以，他们为我把道路开放了
20分钟
OK, so they've opened this road
for 20 minutes for us.

231
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,280
她说我们得走了
She's saying we've got to go.

232
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,800
她说无比路上当心
She said always go very carefully.

233
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
你明白吗？
Did you get that?

234
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
是的，看，当心，当心。
Yep. Look. Careful, careful.

235
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,520
我能通过吗？
Can I get past that?

236
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,920
还在往下吗？
还在往下。
It still coming down?
It's still coming down.

237
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,400
见鬼。
有东西下来了
Bloody hell.
There's stuff coming off.

238
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,960
实际上现在下来的飞快
It's actually coming
down quite fast now.

239
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,680
车上方的山坡不稳定，但是尽管如此，
The mountainside above the car is
unstable, but despite assurances,

240
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
前头的道路现在被封锁了。
the road ahead is now blocked.

241
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,200
我们不得不等等。
简直疯了，是不是？
We have to wait here for a sec.
It's crazy, isn't it?

242
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,640
他们只是说，他们打开过道路，有一个
起重机。
They just said they'd opened the road
and there's a bulldozer.

243
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,080
有一个硕大的起重机在装载一辆卡车。
There's a phenomenal digger
loading up a lorry.

244
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
我觉得我们的确过得去
I think we do just pass.

245
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,960
你微笑了吗？他点头了。
Did you smile? He nodded.

246
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,160
他点头的意思好像说,
“风险自负”
He nodded as if to say,
"Go at your own peril."

247
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,840
护路人员是一个重大五年计划项目成员
来重铺科马斯之路。
This road crew is part of
a major five-year
project to resurface the Comas road.

248
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,920
在丛林，它是一个链接各个孤立的山地社区到
市场集市的至关重要的锁链
It's a vital link that connects
the isolated mountain communities
to market towns in the jungle,

249
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:50,400
并且，所有的150公里的线路，在重铺之前，
需要被辗平，压平
and all 150 kilometres of the route
need to be scraped and compressed
before re-surfacing can begin.

250
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
谢谢！
Gracias.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
这是一个交通拥堵。
Oh, here's a traffic jam.

252
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,040
他们好像蛮乐意在3500米工作，
They look very jolly
about working at 3,500 m,

253
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,720
在一条6或7英尺宽的路面上，
用一个硕大的挖掘机采石采土
quarrying earth on a road
about six or seven feet wide
with an enormous digger.

254
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,320
哇，看那儿
Woah, look at that.

255
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,920
所有的灰尘过来了。
All the dust coming off.

256
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,360
看上去真像是山的一部分倒下了
That really looked like part
of that hill was going fall...

257
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,640
以此同时，我们就在下面。
while we were under it.

258
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:20,360
在科马斯路上，6个小时之后，
他们到达了它的最高点，
海拔4589米
After six hours on the Comas road
they reach its highest point -
4,589 metres above sea level.

259
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,600
在这儿，司机们通常筋疲力尽，
视线模糊。
Drivers often suffer exhaustion
and blurred vision here.

260
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,200
在这样的高度，
人们有时候缺氧。
At this altitude,
people sometimes take oxygen.

261
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
什么，仅仅因为这个高度？
What, just because of the altitude?

262
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,440
是的，你觉得怎么样？
稍微有点头昏
Yeah. How you feeling?
Slightly drowsy.

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,680
你有症状了吧？不，我很好。
You got any symptoms? No, I'm fine.

264
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,640
我头疼了一会，
I've had a slight headache
for a while,

265
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,600
但是，我认为那是因为跟你在一块
的缘故
but I think that's
just being with you.

266
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,040
谢谢。好的。
Thanks. Yeah.

267
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,640
那么，那边的某个地方下去就是丛林
So, somewhere down there
is the jungle.

268
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,080
这使我有了无穷的力量。
That gives me
the feeling of enormous power.

269
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,720
是啊？
没有让你觉得...
Does it you?
Does it make you feel sort of...

270
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,440
是的.这相当的神奇.
我们在云之上了
Yeah. It's pretty amazing
we're above the clouds.

271
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,280
所以,从现在开始,我们奔向丛林,
然后深入丛林.
So from now on,
we're heading down into the jungle,
and then in the jungle

272
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,720
我们要找到康士城.
在80年代建成的那个城市.
we've got to find Constitucion.
Which was built in the '80s?

273
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,000
政府说他们要重迁首都
The government said they
would relocate the capital city

274
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,120
到这个秘鲁的理理位置的中心,
中心点,恰好也是丛林的中心.
to the geographical centre of Peru,
the middle point, which happens to
be in the middle of the jungle.

275
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,640
他们在巴西这么做了.
他们把首都搬到了一个人造的城市,
巴西利亚.
They did it in Brazil.
They moved the capital city to
a man-made one, Brasilia.

276
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,840
我认为大多数的首都城市都是人造的
我不想把你引导到这样的观点上来.
I think most capital cities
are man-made. I don't want
to pick you up on that point.

277
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,680
人工选址,
我们换个词语.
Artificially located,
let's change my wording.

278
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,200
但是在他们摆平科马斯之路之前
还有很长的路要走.
But there's a long way to go
before they get off the Comas road,

279
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,520
并且沉降在今天这样的时候尤其危险
and the descent is particularly
dangerous at this time of day.

280
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,200
我什么都看不见了.
你能看见东西吗?
I can't see anything at all.
Can you see anything?

281
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
我想走路.
I'll walk.

282
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
你能看见东西吗?
Can you see anything?

283
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,040
是的,我能看见...是的.我看到了一点路
在这儿.
Yeah, I can see... Yeah. I've got
a little bit of the road here.

284
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,160
我该走过去另一边吗?
我觉得现在还好,
我想告诉你,如果我...
Shall I walk up the other side?
I think I'm OK for now.
I'll tell you if I...

285
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,760
我从没感受过这么强烈的阳光直射到脸上
I've never had sun quite so strong
straight into the face.

286
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,360
如果我们再有一回陡峭的斜坡,
那么你可以出来
If we have another run of
sheer slope, then you can get out.

287
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,760
好的可视度在这儿是必须的,
因为我们在路上还有更多的困难要克服
Good visibility is essential here,
as there are still more
obstacles to overcome on the road.

288
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
恩,请原谅
Moo. Excuse us.

289
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,440
原谅我们
Excuse us.

290
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,800
那个出去了.
这个没有
That one's getting out the way.
This one isn't.

291
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,680
我要去放牧他们吗?
Shall I go and herd them?
HORN BEEPS

292
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,200
你所做的是,你在放另一只在路上.
What you've done there is,
you've put another one in the way.

293
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,880
你按了喇叭,现在没在路上的也到路上来了
You've honked, and now the one that
wasn't in the way is in the way.

294
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,320
出去,好吗.
Get out.. Right, OK. Hang on...

295
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
是的.这儿有个缺口
That's it. There's a gap.

296
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,400
谢谢,非常感谢.
Thank you, thank you very much.

297
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,640
简单,我们就像PROS
Easy! We're like pros.

298
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,880
ANCHOR奶油的商业宣传引导我相信,
牛会说话.
The Anchor butter commercials led me
to believe that cows could talk,

299
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,840
但是他们看起来似乎什么都不懂.
绝对不懂.
but they didn't seem
to understand anything. Not really.

300
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,440
在云之上行驶了一天之后,
After a day's drive
above the clouds,

301
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,680
小伙子们现在必须退回去到达亚马逊河
the boys must now drop back through
them to get to the Amazon basin.

302
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,760
这给了我们高空飞车幻觉,不是吗?
It does give the illusion
of driving into thin air, doesn't it?

303
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,560
高空飞车...
我可以唱这首歌
Driving in the air...
I could sing that for you.

304
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,920
"雪人"的曲调:
#我们飙车在高空...#
TO TUNE OF "THE SNOWMAN":
# We're driving in the air... #

305
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,760
不!
No!

306
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,160
在黄昏时分,一条几米高的悬崖显现
At dusk, visibility drops
to a few metres,

307
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
在12小时的路之后,
but after 12 hours on the road,

308
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,760
他们开车下来到塞提波,
找个过夜的地方.
they make it down to Satipo,
and a bed for the night.

309
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
本和修完成了亚马逊河
Ben and Hugh have made it
to the Amazon basin

310
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,040
现在必须向着秘鲁的中心雨林进发
and must now head further
into the rainforest
towards the centre of Peru

311
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,120
踏着他们寻找康士城之路
on their search
for the city of Constitucion.

312
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,960
但首先,他们需要商定到皮彻的路
But first, they need to negotiate
the road to Pichanaki,

313
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,800
那里的正午温度能高达40度
where temperatures can reach
40 degrees by midday.

314
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,120
啊!
Agh-yyah!

315
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,720
我就是想叫醒你.
I just wanted to wake you up.

316
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
实际上我挨沙地蚊子的叮咬一夜了
I've been bitten by sand flies,
actually.

317
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,480
脸上都是包
I've got them all over my face.

318
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,040
其实没那么痒.
一点也不痒,就我所见.
是不是很恶心?
They don't actually itch so much.
They don't itch at all, as far as
I can see. Are they nasty? Well,

319
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,520
哦,可能现在不该跟你说这些,
可是他们就是携带者相当恶心的病菌.
probably shouldn't tell you this now,
but they do carry
this rather nasty disease

320
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,760
那儿,他们叫做UTA,
回到英格兰,这被叫做leishmaniasis
that, out here, they call "uta",
and back in England
is called Leishmaniasis.

321
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,560
我不想知道这个。
I don't want to know.

322
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,600
你会好的，修
You'll be fine, Hugh.

323
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,000
秘鲁的亚马逊面积有100万平方公里
The Peruvian Amazon covers
nearly a million square kilometres.

324
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,680
上世纪过后，到这个地区的道路的数量
有了一个很大的增长。
Over the last century, there
has been a vast increase in
the number of roads into the area,

325
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,760
修路是为了来收割富饶的丛林植被财富
built to harvest the enormous
natural wealth of the jungle.

326
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,880
从塞提波到皮彻的路最初是由60年前
伐木工人修建的。
The road from Satipo to Pichanaki
was originally created
by loggers 60 years ago

327
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,120
现在主要被住在沿路的咖啡农民使用
but is now used primarily
by the coffee farmers
who live alongside it.

328
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,160
莉莉安娜经营着她的家族农场。
本地区最早的一个。
Liliana Palomino manages
her family's farm,
one of the oldest in this area.

329
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,240
她的父亲在50年代早去从高山地区
寻找田地而来
Her father arrived here from
the highlands in the early 1950s,
looking for land.

330
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,280
翻译：
TRANSLATION:

331
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,240
所以，她说她的父亲从科马斯来
我们也从那儿来。
So, she's saying that her father came
from Comas, where we've come from,

332
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,760
但是那时候没有我们所走的高速路
很宽的高速路！
but there was no big highway
like we just came on. VAST highway!

333
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,240
都是些小路。
很多都是河路，因为这里是原始雨林
It was small tracks.
A lot of it was river, because this
was virgin rainforest.

334
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,800
莉莉安娜的农场包括超过2000的咖啡
需要手工采收，
Liliana's farm contains
over 2,000 coffee plants which
need to be picked by hand,

335
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
这很可能是个危险的活。
and it can be risky work.

336
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,040
哦。OK!
Oh, OK!

337
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,640
那么，你们有几种蛇虫？
So, what kind of snakes do you have?

338
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,200
这可是一大长串名单！
This is becoming quite a long list!

339
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,480
我认为SHUSHUPE是丛林之王
I think "shushupe" is bushmaster.

340
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,560
丛林之王真恶心，是不是？是。
Bushmasters are nasty,
aren't they? Yep.

341
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,000
她大体上说，道路的好坏他们生活
方式的全部。
What she's basically said is,
the quality of the roads is integral
to their way of living,

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,680
因为，在这里，咖啡就是生命。
because coffee, here, is life.

343
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,800
所以，希望没有丛林之王回到路上
你需要向导吗？
So, hopefully no bushmasters on
our way back. Do you want to lead?

344
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,560
那很糟糕吗？
Was that bad?

345
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,320
本大笑
非常糟糕。哦。对不起
BEN LAUGHS
Quite bad, yeah. Sorry.

346
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,240
这毁了我们印第安纳琼斯的信用
That ruins my Indiana Jones
credibility there.

347
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,480
Not that I ever had any!

348
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,840
未经铺砌的皮彻的道路是去集市的
必经之地。
The unpaved Pichanaki road
is the only way for
locals to get to market,

349
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
在这条路线上事故频频
and there are frequent accidents
on this route.

350
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,040
看这个孩子
Look at this child.

351
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,720
有4个人在那儿。
有4个人在单车上。
There are four people on there.
There's four people on that bike,

352
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,600
那个孩子用一个类似围巾的什么
东西披裹着。
抓稳点
and that child has just got a...
like a...shawl wrapped around it,
holding it on.

353
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
谢谢。谢谢。
Gracias. Gracias.

354
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,880
你说西班牙语谢谢是期待四个人回应吗？
Do you say "gracias" because
you were expecting four back?

355
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,160
是的，我期待每个人...小心翼翼
Yeah, I was expecting each one to...
Check this out!

356
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,040
有个人，在后备箱！
哦，不，是不女士。太神奇了。
There is a man. In the boot!
Oh, no, a woman. Fantastic.

357
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,480
很搞笑。
他们所做的事，，，
That's very funny.
What they've done...

358
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,680
是个老太太，
他们被搁在车后面。
It's an old lady,
they've put in the back of the car!

359
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,800
他们把奶奶放在了后备箱。
They've put Grandma in the boot!

360
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,280
我们该同样的超过这辆卡车吗？是的
Shall we take over this truck
as well? Yeah.

361
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,160
你对此唯一能感到欣慰的是她没有被
捆绑在顶盖上。真的！
The only good thing you can say
about that is that she wasn't
strapped to a roof rack. True!

362
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
经过一个灰尘扑扑的5个小时的驾驶
之后，他们到达了皮彻。
After a dusty five-hour drive,
they reach Pichanaki,

363
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,200
一个买咖啡橘子水果的繁忙集市。
a busy town where coffee and citrus
fruits and are brought to market.

364
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,240
不确定这个卡车是干嘛的。它要左转了，
我认为，由转向灯看出。
Not quite sure what this truck's
doing. It's turning left,
I think, by the indicator.

365
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,120
哦，我在丛林里太久了，我几乎要
得城市综合症了。
Oh... I've been in the jungle for so
long, I'm almost getting urban shock.

366
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,880
这条路被修建于60年代来刺激移民从
山地来此。
This road was built in the 1960s to
encourage migration
from the highlands,

367
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,280
现在它是在秘鲁丛林里最繁忙
的地方之一了。
and it's now one of the busiest
in the Peruvian jungle.

368
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,720
大量的这些小马力出租车之类的。
Lots of these little
motor taxi things.

369
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,960
这些三轮车之类的？
似乎有相当多。
有上千辆。
These three-wheel drive things?
There seems to be quite a lot.
There are thousands of them.

370
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,200
当道路延伸到皮彻这里的时候，
是一个300人的村庄。
When the road arrived in Pichanaki,
it was a village of 300 people

371
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,960
周围地区住满了土著部落。
and the surrounding area was
populated by indigenous tribes.

372
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,280
今天，这些部落经受着流入到此
的6000外来常驻人口的挤压。
Today, those tribes have been
pushed out by an influx
of over 60,000 settlers.

373
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,240
本和修在进一步向雨林，
秘鲁的中心，
进发之前在此过夜
Ben and Hugh stay the night here
before heading further
into the rainforest

374
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,880
and the centre of Peru.

375
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,040
为了到达那儿，他们首先要经过
山里的丛林到波祖城
To get there, they first
have to drive the
mountain jungle road to Pozuzo,

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
这个城市依傍着险峻的皮彻河
which runs alongside
the dangerous Pichanaki River.

377
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,560
which runs alongside
the dangerous Pichanaki River.

378
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,320
我打赌冬天时雨季
I bet in the winter,
when it's rainy season,

379
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,120
I bet in the winter,
when it's rainy season,

380
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,160
这个一定会充满
this must just fill up.

381
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,480
皮彻，亚马逊强大属地
The Pichanaki, a powerful tributary
of the Amazon,

382
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,080
能升高4米，在当下这个水平上
can rise four metres
above its current level.

383
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,880
道路的整个断面有规律的被冲刷掉
Whole sections of this road are
regularly washed away,

384
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,360
这就是几次重大事故的情景
and it's been the scene of several
fatal accidents.

385
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,480
看见这一点了吗？这看起来像被诅咒
的什么东西。
See this bit here? That looks like
it's been blasted, or something.

386
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,120
它这儿有一些直线。
摩擦的痕迹。那么是怎么回事呢?
It's got these lines in it.
Scrape marks. So what are they?

387
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,000
护路对在进行着一场无望的战争
Maintenance teams are fighting
a desperate battle

388
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,240
从塌陷的河床把道路转移并保持
道路通行。
to move the road away from the
collapsing riverbank
and keep it open to traffic.

389
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,360
这的确看起来像他们LAY什么东西在那儿
是不是呀？
It does look they're laying something
up there, doesn't it?

390
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,480
他们打开了一些什么线圈
他们在管子里粘了东西。
这些家伙，
They're uncoiling something.
They're sticking things in tubes.
This bloke here,

391
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,640
我认为他们放进去了一个管子
并且他弄了一个棍棒
I think they've put a tube in
and he's got a stick

392
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,000
and he's ramming...charge, I guess.

393
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,200
如果他们打算引爆那个，
我们将有一个极度
If they are going to blow that up,
we're going to have an
extraordinary...

394
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,840
长久的等待？坐下来看看风景。
Long wait? ..seating view.

395
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,680
这就是我们之间的不同。
我真的很激动。
你在担心交通阻塞
That's the difference between us.
I'm really excited,
you're worried about the traffic jam!

396
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,240
对于本不幸的是，
首席工程师哈罗德
Unfortunately for Ben,
chief engineer Harold Abad

397
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,600
想要所有的机动车离开道路
在爆破开始之前。
wants all vehicles to clear the road
before blasting begins.

398
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,920
海，我是修
海，我是哈罗德。
我是本
你讲英语吗？
多少会一点。
Hi, I'm Hugh. Hi, Harold.
I'm Ben. You speak English?
More or less.

399
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,760
你们怎么清掉那个石头？
钻一个孔？
是的。
放炸药进去？
How do you clear that rock?
Drill a hole? Yeah. Put dynamite in?

400
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,000
是的，我们有一个孔，或许3米
Yeah, we have a hole
maybe three metres...

401
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,200
放一些TNT和爆炸物。
现在他们正在这么做吗？
put some TNT...and explosions.
And that's what they're doing now?

402
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,560
是的。
Yeah.

403
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,800
你工作在炸药和山崩的环境下，
这一定是非常危险的工作吧？
是的，
You're working with dynamite
and landslides, that must be very
dangerous work? Yeah,

404
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,040
因为这里，不是多牢固，这个地方，
because here, it's not
exactly strong, this part.

405
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,760
举例来说，昨天，我们正工作，
For example, yesterday,
we were working

406
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,760
我们遇到了非常非常大的岩石滚下来。
and we have, coming down,
very, very big rocks,

407
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,080
去年，我们有一个人因为这个情况死了
and the last year, we have
one people die for that reason.

408
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,680
别岩石压死？
是的，他死了，过世了
Hit by a rock?
Yeah, he died, he pass away.

409
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,600
所以对我们来说在这条路上最危险的时候
可能会是他们爆破的时候？啊。
So the most dangerous time
for us to be on this road would be
when they blow it up? Uh-huh.

410
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,840
所以我们需要远离这条路？
啊。
So we need to get out of the way?
Uh-huh.

411
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,880
我们要走了。好的。再见。
再见，再见
We'll get going. OK. See you. Bye.
Bye. See you.

412
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,360
车被交通阻塞了2个小时了已经
The car's been stuck in traffic
for two hours now,

413
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,600
仍然有另外的30公里的道路工作
要进行。
and there's still another
30km of roadworks to get through.

414
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,040
他们鸣笛
They honked.

415
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,680
喇叭声
HORN BEEPS

416
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,920
很好的鸣笛，
我注意到他们那么做了
That's a good honk,
I've noticed they do that here.

417
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,400
你已经变得像我妻子了。
你靠过去。
You've become like my wife,
you lean across.

418
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,160
侵犯了你的私人地盘了吗？
是的
Was that encroaching on your
personal space? Yeah.

419
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,520
我变得更熟稔了没有
是的。嗯。
Am I becoming too over-familiar?
Yes, hmm.

420
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,680
我总是其他的司机们非常关心
I've always been most concerned
about other drivers -

421
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,160
我不是说的修=但是我一会回来
and I don't necessarily mean Hugh -
but I'll get
back to that in a second.

422
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,240
哇，别
刮擦声
Whoa! Try not to...
SCRAPING

423
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,360
我不想
不，不，我意思是，我怎么能
避免那个呢？
I won't bottom out the car.
No, no. I mean, how could I have
avoided that?

424
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,160
修和我已经在车里几天了。
我感觉信心满满。
Hugh and I have been in a car
for a few days now,
and I'm feeling confident,

425
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,600
但是地形变化了，
所以在山里信心满满是另外一回事
but the terrain has changed,
so it's one thing feeling confident
up in the mountains,

426
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,360
在丛林里是既然不同的。
it's different in the jungle.

427
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,680
现在不要再走了。那辆卡车已经
挨的尽可能的近了。
Don't go more to the right now. That
truck is close enough as it is.

428
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,360
本在他跟人们道谢的时候做了这件事
Ben does this thing whereby he says
thank you to people...

429
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,360
人们显然听不见他的话，他们
在几英里之外。
who obviously can't hear him,
who are miles away.

430
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,360
我认为如果你再往右一点，，，谢谢
I think if you had gone
more to the right... Gracias!

431
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,760
嗯，如果我再往右一点？
Hmm. If I'd gone more to the right?

432
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,440
而不是往，，，他会说，谢谢
Rather than just going...
he will actually go, "Thank you!"

433
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,840
我们将会被卡在这辆卡车的后面整天？
你想让我超车？
Are we going to be stuck behind
this truck for the whole way?
You want me to overtake?

434
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,720
哦，，，他想让我超车。
是的。他做了。走，走，，，，
Well... He wants me to overtake.
Yeah, he does. Go, go, go, go, go.

435
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,520
我只是说说。
I was just chatting.

436
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,200
谢谢
Gracias.

437
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,000
走，嘿，看，现在，你已经把自己
在右边了。
你打算做什么？
Go. Hey, look, now. Now you've
got yourself in a right pickle.
What are you going to do?

438
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,920
我打算避开这辆货车并且打算避开面包车
你是不是打算切碎他？
I'm going to avoid the lorry
and I'm going to avoid the minibus.
Weren't you just cutting him up?

439
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,360
面包车，看，干得好。
The minibus. Look. Well done.

440
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,160
本和修现在一路灰尘地，
已经到达了H峡谷
Ben and Hugh have now reached
the Huancabamba canyon and the dirt
track which runs alongside it.

441
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,640
这是一条众所周知的情况多变的路
It's a notoriously unstable road

442
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,680
有着300米的悬崖通向下方的河
with drops of over 300 metres
into the river below.

443
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,560
我认为这是我们遇见过的最崎岖的一段。
I think this is the bumpiest section
we've been on. Yes.

444
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,320
你觉得以15英里的时速有可能
WHIPLASH?
我认为如此。
Is it possible to get whiplash
at 15 miles an hour? I think so.

445
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,240
稳住。
Steady...

446
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,720
这儿是峡谷的最高点
This is the highest point
of the canyon,

447
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
即将面临的路况是一个真正的危险
and oncoming traffic is
a real danger.

448
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,600
在2009,2名游客从这条路上滚落
In 2009, two tourists veered
off the road here

449
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,720
在下方的山谷里丢掉了性命
and plunged to their deaths
in the valley below.

450
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,280
不约而同:噢！
BOTH: Ohhh-ohhh!

451
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,640
在这停下？
他让我们过去那边
Stop here?
He wants us to go over here.

452
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,440
他让我们过去吗？
我不知道。
Does he want us to go over here?
I don't know.

453
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,560
这是一个单行道，卡车不打算让路
It's a single-track road
and the trucks aren't giving way.

454
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,120
我应该过去吗
Shall I go into there?

455
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,720
哦，我太靠近了。
Oh, blimey. How close am I?

456
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
空间足够大吗？
Is that enough room?

457
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
看看这儿的悬崖
Look at this drop here.

458
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,640
他相当的顽固，是不是？
He was fairly insistent, wasn't he?

459
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,520
他不想我们过去。好像说，
“你打算过去，伙计”
He didn't want us to go there. That
was like, "You're going there, mate."

460
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,200
我认为打滑的厉害
I thought that was quite slick.

461
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
你认为他们会不会说，
我们不是附近的人
Do you think they could tell
we weren't from around here?

462
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,520
那是什么？威尔克。
What's that? Wilkommen.

463
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,000
威尔克在，，，那说的是什么？
Wilkommen in... What does that say?

464
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,080
波祖
Pozuzo.

465
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,960
(西语）
你能翻译那么吗？
Einzigen Osterriechisch Deutschen
kolonie der welt.
Can you translate that?

466
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,800
欢迎来波祖
全世界唯一的奥地利德国殖民地
Welcome to Pozuzo -
the only Austrian, German colony...

467
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,440
1859，很奇怪
in the world. 1859. This is weird.

468
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
很奇怪
This is weird.

469
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,280
看起来我们到达了一个奥地利村庄
It looks like we have arrived
in an Austrian village.

470
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,120
非常的没有秘鲁味儿
This is so un-Peruvian.

471
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,480
像个滑雪胜地，不是吗？
It's like a ski resort, isn't it?

472
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,600
丛林滑雪胜地
A ski resort in the jungle.

473
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,440
同样的，难以置信的宜人，不是吗？
It's incredibly neat
as well, isn't it?

474
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,400
有点怪怪的，像个微缩城，不是吗？
This is a bit freaky, it's
a bit like a toy town, isn't it?

475
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,280
看上去很德国味儿-那个人看起来
很德国味儿
He looks German -
that man looked German.

476
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,280
哪儿？那儿。看他多高大！
Where? There. Look how tall he is!

477
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:48,160
沉迷于民俗老一套对我来说非常危险
There is a very, very great danger
of me starting to indulge in
national stereotyping.

478
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,000
究竟为什么这儿会有这么一个地方的？
How on earth
did a place like this get here?

479
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,120
那是我也没法理解的。
That's what I don't understand.

480
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,200
波祖仍然居住着中19世界移民过来的
欧洲人后裔
Pozuzo is still inhabited
by the descendants of the

481
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,040
European settlers, who arrived
here in the mid 19th century.

482
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,080
就像本地约瑟居民一样。
Like local resident Jose Castrada.

483
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,880
我们注意到在丛林中部的广场中间
有个巨轮
We can't help but notice there is an
enormous ship in the middle
of the square -

484
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,160
这个究竟干吗出现这儿的？
in the middle of the jungle
here. What on earth is this here?

485
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,000
故事开始于1850,
The story began

486
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,920
政府曾在秘鲁这里寻求丛林中心
地带的殖民拓展
in 1850. The Government here
in Peru pursued the idea of
colonising the central jungle.

487
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,720
334人从安特卫普登船-一部分是
奥地利人，一部分是德国人。
334 people board in Antwerp -
a part of them were Austrians
and a part of them were Germans.

488
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,560
所以，你能告诉我们一些航行的
情况吗？花了多久时间？
So, can you tell us a bit about the
boat journey and how long it took?

489
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,440
大约4个月从安特卫普来到这里
It took about four months
to come here from Antwerp.

490
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,960
是一个GUANO船-配给了水，
食物，一切
It was a guano ship -
they ration the water, they
ration the food and everything.

491
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,640
我认为6人死了。所以，船上发生
过相当悲惨的事
I think six people died there. So,
pretty miserable existence on board.

492
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,680
当然
Of course.

493
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,840
他们在秘鲁的这个地方登陆，
跋涉了2年多来到这儿
They landed here in Peru
and they hiked more than two years
to come here.

494
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,760
从这儿到这儿花了他们2年的时间？
It took them two years
to get from the coast...?

495
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,480
是的。从这里的海岸
Yeah, from the coast here.

496
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,080
离波祖只有180
Only 180 came here to Pozuzo.

497
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,680
那么，失踪的150人怎样了？
So, what happened to

498
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,880
that missing 150 or so?

499
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,360
很多放弃了，很多死在途中
Lots of them gave up
and lots of them died on the way.

500
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,000
病死吗？
Died from disease?

501
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,560
病死，饿死，冻死，等等
From disease, from hunger,
cold and so on.

502
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
那么，他们到这儿的时候期待
什么结果？
So, what were they
expecting when they got here?

503
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,800
他们是不是认为原本应该有建筑
和道路？他们被保证过什么承诺？
Did they think there would
be buildings and roads,
what were they promised?

504
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,480
没有，他们期待有田地，有
一条路通往首都
No, they was expecting to
have land and to have
a road connection to the capital.

505
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,040
其实没有？
没有。
Which they didn't?
They didn't.

506
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,320
那么，这条路什么时候终于修到这儿的？
So when did the road finally arrive?

507
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,480
哦，被隔绝之后的100年，1975年
Well, after 100 years of isolation,
in 1975,

508
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,920
这条路第一次修到波祖这儿
the road arrived here in Pozuzo
for the first time.

509
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,520
随着道路通到这儿的还有新东西，
新材料，新通讯。
And with the road came
also the new things - new materials,
new communications.

510
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,000
还有财富？还有财富
And wealth? And wealth also.

511
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,640
约瑟，谢谢你。谢谢。
Jose, thank you very much. Thank you.

512
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,680
西语
Auf Wiedersehn. Auf Wiedersehn.

513
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,800
自从路修道这儿，波祖就繁荣起来
Pozuzo has thrived since
the arrival of the road

514
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,640
但是它保持了欧洲的根和骄傲，
依然能受到德国和奥地利的财政
支持
but it remains proud of its European
roots and still receives financial
support from Germany and Austria.

515
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,560
旅程的下一个阶段是找到康士城，
从波祖出发，横穿恐怖
The next stage of the journey to
find the city of Constitucion,
runs from Pozuzo across the fearsome

516
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,240
的H峡谷，到C镇
Huancabamba Canyon,
to the town of Codo.

517
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,680
但是首先，他们需要更换车辆，
因为前方的路普通的4*4驱不动
But first they need to change their
vehicle, as the road ahead can't
be driven in an ordinary 4x4.

518
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,080
这家车行出租有着高车盘
的PICK-UP卡车，
This garage rents pick-up trucks
with higher ground clearance

519
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,480
以对付最具挑战性的丛林小径
to cope with the most
challenging jungle tracks.

520
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,680
这就是我们的车了。
我认为如此。（西语）
So this must be our car.
I think so, Hola, senor.

521
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,200
他们说西班牙语
THEY SPEAK SPANISH

522
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,400
他说，这就是我们在这种路上
所需要的车
So he said, this is the car
we wanted for the route.

523
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
让我们四处观察一下。
你踢那个干吗？
Let's have a look around.
Why do you kick that?

524
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,880
大家都这么做
我看见过。
你知道踢了就有好处
It's what everyone does.
I've seen them. You kick it
and it makes it look good.

525
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,080
尽管你不知道为什么。
我检查一下后边
You have no idea what it's for
though. I'm going to check the back.

526
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,520
很棒，我们之一可以骑在顶上
This is great, one of us
can ride up in the top here.

527
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,600
那对我很好。我开车，你呆在那儿
That's fine by me, I'll drive
you stay up there.

528
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
你不觉得太自大了吗？
Do you think it'll be bouncy?

529
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,600
哦！
Oooh!

530
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,160
从波祖出来的路交叉了若干条
急落入河的急流，
The road out of Pozuzo is
crossed by several streams,
which cascade into

531
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,760
the river below,
使得路面不可预测，并易于塌陷
making the road-surface
unpredictable and prone to collapse.

532
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,600
哦，当地人说这是即将面临的
最大的困难
Well, the locals say that this
is one of

533
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,560
the hardest parts that's coming up.

534
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,880
实际上，我第一次觉得有一点紧张。
I'm actually, for the first time,
feeling a little bit nervous.

535
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,480
看这个!
Look at this!

536
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
路通往哪里？
Where does the road go?

537
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,800
路在哪里？
Where is the road?

538
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,840
我认为路曾经一度通往那里
I think the road used to go there.

539
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,480
穿过那儿？
那儿一定是路
Across there?
That must be the road there.

540
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
抱歉，你看不见，是不是？
Sorry, you couldn't
really see it, could you?

541
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,760
你看好路
You keep your eyes on the road,

542
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,600
或者说看好小径或者看准了泥巴路，
随便我们怎么称呼它吧。
or one the track or on the
mud, whatever we call it.

543
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,000
我的确认为你应该在这个点上仔细点
I do think you should be
careful at this bit here.

544
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,960
因为直行？
Because it's straight on?

545
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,520
哦，因为我可以看到那儿有直行标记
并且看起来已经有某个人这么做了
Well,
because I can see there are marks

546
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,480
that go straight on and it looks
like someone's done that already.

547
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,440
有，是不是有？
这是人们刹车的地方。
There are, aren't there?
This is where people skid off.

548
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,520
这些轮胎的痕迹刚好经过了边缘
Those tyre tracks go
right over the edge.

549
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
那边一辆车也没有，是不是？
There's not a car over
there, is there?

550
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,000
哦，偶的神！
Oh, Lord!

551
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,640
简直疯了
This is mad.

552
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,560
这不是路
This is not a road.

553
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,760
本和修距离秘鲁中心仍然还有350公里
Ben and Hugh are still
350 kilometres away from the centre

554
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,360
被选为康士城新首都的场所
of Peru and the site chosen for
the new capital of Constitucion.

555
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,000
你认为我们能找到这个地方吗？
Do you think we'll find this place?

556
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,680
我担心的事是我们没在地图上
I find it a bit worrying
that it's not on our map

557
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,320
见过它，只是有人听说过它
that we were looking at but
other people have heard of it.

558
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,280
有人听说过它。
它在八十年代被修建。
Some people have heard of it.
It was only built in the 1980s.

559
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,400
哦，我们甚至不知道它被建到什么程度
Well, we don't
even know how much of it was built.

560
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,720
我们越我前走，我越觉得这个新手段的
念头越荒唐。
And the further we go,
the more ridiculous I think
this idea of a new capital is.

561
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,960
他们现在不得不过河到达CODO的城镇
They now have to cross the
river to reach the town of Codo.

562
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,440
一条新的双行道大桥正在施工，
但不幸的是得有个几周才能开放通行
A brand new two-lane bridge is under
construction but unfortunately it
doesn't open for another few weeks.

563
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,000
他们就不得不从老桥过，
老桥正准备拆除
They will have to use the old
bridge, which is currently
being prepared for demolition.

564
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
哦，见鬼！
Oh, bloody hell.

565
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,520
不不！看那个！
No way! Look at that!

566
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,320
哦，上帝！
Oh, my God!

567
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,720
当他们接近桥下的时候，
修很担心刹车制动器
As they approach the bridge,
Hugh is worried about the brakes.

568
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,680
感觉怎么样？
How does that feel?

569
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,520
应该没事，只要我能停下车
Should be all right,
as long as I can stop it.

570
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,360
哦，就是这样，你能行吗？
要不要试试这里。哦。现在我可以了
Well, that's the thing, can you? Do
you want to try here. Oh, I can now.

571
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,320
你可以了吗？一定能停下吗？
You can? Definitely stop?

572
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,120
我们打算，，，认真的说，我们打算
径直通过那个边缘
We're going... I'm serious though
we will go straight over that edge.

573
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,680
盯紧了，，，
Look at this tight...

574
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,520
你得怎么转过去
You've got to somehow turn here.

575
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,920
你得做到一个无比高分的转向
You're going to have to
do a zillion point turn.

576
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,200
我一点都没就绪
I'm not in any gear.

577
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,320
挂离合
Push the clutch.

578
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,440
以便从低回到高，现在你可以就绪了吗？
That's low so that should be back
into high, so can you get a gear now?

579
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
你在倒车吗？我不想倒车，我想前进
Are you into reverse? I don't
want reverse, I want to go forward.

580
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
你现在应该能了，好的
You should be able to now, OK.

581
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,680
OK,OK,原来越近了
OK, OK, that's probably close.

582
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,200
你需要我出来在那边指方向吗？
是的
Do you want me to actually get
out and point you over here?
Yeah.

583
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,520
西语
Hola, senor.

584
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,720
把她拉一边去。
Pull her round this way.

585
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
他们说西班牙。
THEY SPEAK SPANISH

586
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,560
她说这很安全
He said it's safe.

587
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
转，继续转
Turning, turning more.

588
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,120
你有了很大的空间，
修，大得多的空间
You've got lots of room here,
Hugh, lots more room.

589
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,920
是的，但这边没有
Yeah, but none here.

590
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,840
我得回去，我做不到，我得回去
I've got to go back, I can't
do that. I've got to go back.

591
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,480
皮卡紧紧的靠着支撑大桥的一根
柱子上
The pick-up is pressing
against one of the pillars
holding the bridge up.

592
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,320
现在工程师说
And now the engineer is concerned.

593
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,720
他说西语
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

594
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
哇
Whoa!

595
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,360
你还好吗？
You OK?

596
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,160
我得回去
I've got to go back.

597
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,240
打方向盘，
继续打，
Turn the wheels around,
turn the wheels more,

598
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
再转，接着转
turn them more, turn the wheels more.

599
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
是的，是的，很好
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,880
引擎转数
ENGINE REVS

601
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,880
开始转，再转，
Start turning, turning more. Full on.

602
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,520
现在往这一边打方向
Now turn the wheels
over to this side here.

603
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
OK.

604
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,640
THEY SPEAK SPANISH

605
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
OK.

606
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,880
你还没有穿过大桥这一点是最可怕的
We're not even across the bridge
yet and that's the most terrifying
bit of it.

607
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,920
难以置信。
我们还没下来
This is unbelievable.
We're not off it yet.

608
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,160
那边怎么样了？
How am I doing on that side?

609
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,640
你有了很多空隙了
You've got lots of room.

610
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,880
当你说很多空隙，，，
很多。戈登！
When you say loads of room...
Lots. Gordon Bennett!

611
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,920
看开点。你能感到吗？
Look at it bouncing. Can you feel it?

612
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,720
是的，不哟着急，我现在走得很慢
Yeah, don't worry,
I'm going very slowly now.

613
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,400
哇!我要跳起来了
Woo hoo! I'm going to jump.

614
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,440
看一下，难以置信。
我打算出来，看一下
Have a look, that is unbelievable.
I'm gonna get out
and have a look at that.

615
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,200
是的，那是一座可怕的桥要通过
Yeah, that was a terrifying
bridge to go across.

616
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,360
当他打方向的时候，他们在进入WIRE,
实际上挂在了桥上
When he was turning his wheels, they
were going into the wire and actually
hanging over the bridge.

617
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,880
你留了多少汗？很多。
How much did you sweat? Quite a lot.

618
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,320
你也要感受一下吗？
一点也不想
Do you want to feel that?
Not really.

619
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:07,560
我在操作，本在指引，
所以我如果撞到柱子，至少40%
是他的错
I was steering, Ben was guiding,
so the fact I hit the pillar
is at least 40% his fault.

620
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,720
那么，没有卡车能通过那儿，是不是？
So, no truck can get across there,
can it?

621
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,640
我们今天看见2辆卡车了
We have seen two trucks today.

622
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,040
他们都没有通过去，是不是？
They can't have come
across that, can they?

623
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,560
这是“BIEN DANADO”
It was "bien danado",

624
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,520
意思是徒劳无功，
像一个工人所说的，
好像我们往后倒退了
which means well damaged,
as one of the workmen said as we
drove past afterwards.

625
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,040
我对修隐瞒了这个秘密。
我认为他有一点
I kept that secret from Hugh.
I think he was a bit...

626
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,480
我觉得他有一点受打击
I think he felt a bit dented himself.

627
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,440
我们应该继续吗？是的，我们来吧
Shall we carry on? Yeah, let's.

628
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,320
我觉得，我早早就会得心脏病。
你能开车吗？
I thought I was going
to have a heart attack earlier.
Can you drive?

629
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,760
我能开车吗？
Can I drive?

630
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,160
搞清楚这座桥花了几个钟头，
他们不得不抹黑赶完到CODO的剩下的路
It's taken an hour to clear the
bridge and they have to drive

631
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,200
the rest of the road in the dark
before reaching Codo,
where they can plan the route ahead.

632
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,880
这最后的一点
This last bit.

633
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,920
我们在H峡谷了，你知道吗？
We were in the Canyon of the
Huancas, did you know that?

634
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,200
现在，我们从这儿上去，
然后这里的某个地方
And now we go up here
and then somewhere in here...

635
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,240
就是康士城
is Constitucion...

636
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,880
相当可怕的事情是，这儿也没有路，
and what's rather alarming
about it is there is no road

637
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,760
也没有路标，更甚的，没有这座
迷失之城的线索
or road marks. And, more notably,
no mention of the lost city.

638
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,880
我们得找到它。
哦，应该会很容易
And we've got to find it.
Well, that should be easy.

639
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,680
本和修现在已经进入了他们旅程
的最后阶段
Ben and Hugh have now reached
the final stage of their journey.

640
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,200
康士城传闻位于秘鲁的地理中心位置
Constitucion reportedly lies at
the geographical centre of Peru.

641
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,040
要到达那儿，他们必须离开河谷，
To get there, they must leave
the river valley,

642
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,840
然后穿过沼泽，向着丛林中心驶去
then drive across swampland
into the heart of the jungle.

643
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,600
但是峡谷还有一个最后的可怕的
爬坡要克服
But the canyon has one
final terrifying climb to negotiate.

644
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,680
现在是上午很早的时候
It's too early
in the morning for this.

645
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,800
这么狭窄。我能说，我看不见那儿没有
悬崖吗？
This is so narrow. Can I say, I
can't see where the drop is there?

646
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,240
尽可能的靠近那边，我能搞定那个
悬崖吗？
Keep as close to that side as
you can. Am I OK with that drop?

647
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,960
哦，上帝，我觉得我挂在这边了。
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm
actually hanging over the side.

648
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:13,280
皮卡被陷在了峻峭的岩石和湍流的
卡班巴河之间。
The pick-up is trapped
between a sheer rock-face and
the fast-flowing Huancabamba river.

649
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,240
对，现在穿过去吧。
过去。
Right, get over there now.
Get over there.

650
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,440
还有一点。
There's another bit.

651
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,240
尽可能的靠近那一边
Close to that side as you can now.

652
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,680
杀了我吧。
Bugger me.

653
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,480
告诉我多远。尽可能的靠近那堵墙
Tell me how far. Just stay as
close as you can to that wall.

654
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,960
不要担心这一边，只要你尽可能的
保持靠近
Don't worry about this side but
if you keep as close as you can...

655
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,760
我看不见那一边
过去，过去，
那儿，过去
I can't see that side.
Get over there, get over
there, get over there.

656
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,520
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

657
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,520
如果我撞上石头，
我会弹进去
If I hit the rock,
I'll bounce back in.

658
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,440
哦，那就不要撞上石头
Well, don't hit the rock then.

659
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,040
他们终于搞清了河谷并靠近了
秘鲁中心
They have finally cleared
the river valley
and are close to the centre of Peru.

660
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,480
这条路的这个路段才修建了几年而已，
This section of the road was only
built a few years ago but already

661
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,520
但对当地环境已经产生了巨大的影响
has had a huge impact
on the local environment.

662
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,600
非法砍伐已经砍出来大片的雨林空地
Illegal tree felling has cleared
vast areas of rainforest

663
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,680
非法放牧也使得丛林不能再恢复
and cattle farming ensures that
the jungle cannot grow back.

664
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,160
在地图上，我们位于丛林的中心位置
On the map, we are in the middle

665
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,080
你记得所看到过的这一点吗？
of the jungle,
do you remember looking at that?

666
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,120
没有路，周围什么也没有
There was no roads - nothing around.

667
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,960
这里本应该是繁茂的原始森林
So this should be thick,
primary jungle.

668
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,800
看看我们周围
And look around us.

669
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,320
我猜这条路基本上被用来运送
木材了，不是吗？
I guess this road mostly is
just used to take wood, isn't it?

670
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,200
运送原木。
看看这些树-好大的树
Take logs.
See these trees here - the big ones.

671
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,200
尽管这些只是他们砍剩下的。
It looks to me as though they're
the ones that have been left.

672
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,280
他们砍伐了大片区域的树木，不是吗？
They've cleared massive
areas of trees, haven't they?

673
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,880
这些道路往雨林深处延伸越多，
The further these roads
encroach into the rainforest,

674
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,960
他们打算开发的自然资源就越多
the more the natural resources
they're going to be exploiting.

675
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,040
这地方可能会是濒临灭绝的首个风景
之一
This could be one of the first
landscapes that becomes extinct.

676
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,800
距离本和修路程的终点现在只有75KM
The end of Ben and Hugh's journey
is now only 75 kilometres away.

677
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:22,400
但是这条路最后的这段路2年前才
刚刚修完，甚至不曾出现在地图上过
But this final stage of the road
was only completed two years ago
and doesn't even appear on the map.

678
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,120
只是像MUD路一样的仅仅被当地人所知
It's known to locals
simply as the Mud Road.

679
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,320
这是条不错的路，是不是呀
This is a good road, isn't it?

680
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,760
好的，那么，现在，我们想要到
这个里边去。
OK, so now we want to go
into this one over here -

681
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,200
从右边出来
so out to the right.

682
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,920
我被陷住了
I'm stuck.

683
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,720
现在，先进去，如果你绕着右边一点
拉出来
Now into first and if you pull it
around to the right a little bit...

684
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,880
他们才走了3公里，但是他们已经陷住了
They have only gone three kilometres
but they are already stuck.

685
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,560
打转了，打转了。
It's spinning, spinning.

686
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,280
你想干什么，修，你弄了些干燥的
东西上来，是的，的确
What you want to do, Hugh,
you've got some drier stuff
up here, yeah, exactly.

687
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,320
好，满满来，
Nice, slow tread...

688
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,120
我们正要回到洞里了。我得回去
We're going to go back into
that hole. I've got to go back.

689
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,800
如果皮卡不能穿过泥巴，他们就麻烦了
If the pick-up can't get through
the mud, they are trouble.

690
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,360
在丛林中间可没有什么救援服务
There are no rescue services
in the middle of the jungle.

691
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,760
如果你右打方向，
If you turn the wheels right...

692
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,840
我不知道你能不能得到足够的牵引力
I don't know
if you can get enough traction.

693
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,080
这正要把我送回到那个洞里面
It's going to
send me back into that hole.

694
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,840
啊，差一点了
Agh, so nearly.

695
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,720
我们所需要做的事是尽量得到牵引力
并指向那个方向-那条路
What we want to do is try
and get traction up
pointing into the jungle - that way.

696
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,680
这才是我们所需要尝试做的事
有个小斜坡，是的，满满来，是的
It's what we want to try and do.
There's a bit of a slope, yeah.
Nice slow traction, yeah.

697
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,240
走，走，，，，，
Go, go, go, go, go...

698
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,440
继续走，继续走，
Keep going, keep going!

699
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,480
好的，现在在哪儿了？
Yes! Now where?

700
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,560
进来了。径直往那儿。是的。
Into here. Straight on there. Yep.

701
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,960
进来一点
Into this bit.

702
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,320
先不要乐
Don't smile yet.

703
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,400
我们还有50英里呢。
We've still got another 50 miles.

704
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,400
这个嘛!我知道。
Of this! I know.

705
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,640
其他的车辆稀少而远离，在MUN路上
Other vehicles are few and
far between on the Mud Road.

706
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:40,000
这个属于约瑟的-一个当地的市长，为这
一区域的道路负责的官员
This one belongs to Jose Caballero -
a local mayor and the official
responsible for roads in this area.

707
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,960
那么，谁修了这条路？
So who built this road?

708
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
他修的
He built it.

709
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,240
我是说，为了我们。
I'm saying, for us,

710
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,880
有一点困难。
it's a little bit difficult.

711
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,040
他说，在他们这儿的冬季，
这个是封路的，这一时期能通行吗？
What he's saying is,
in their winter, this is impassable.
At the moment this is good?

712
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,720
这是条很棒的路，如果我们被
陷住会怎样？
This is a great road.
What happens if we get stuck?

713
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,320
关键的事情是跟另一辆车一起赶路，
并确保能有个绳子把其中一个拖出来。
The key is to go with another vehicle
and make sure they've got
ropes to pull one out.

714
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,280
没有机动车接待处在这里，什么都没有
No mobile reception or anything here.

715
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,800
你愿意跟我们同行吗？
Would you like to come with us?

716
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,560
我说，开个玩笑。
I said it's a joke.

717
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,200
我认为他当真了。
我们也当真了，不是吗，某种程度上
I think he was taking you seriously,
although we are being serious,
aren't we, in a kind of way?

718
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,880
本已经翻越了MUD路的最后路段，
他们希望沿着这段路达到康士城
Ben has taken over for the final
section of the Mud Road, which
they hope leads to Constitucion.

719
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,760
甚至经验丰富的本地司机也会
在这儿陷住。
Even experienced local
drivers get bogged down here.

720
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,240
从这一边穿过，你认为呢？
Cross over to this
side, do you think?

721
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,160
是的，那一边似乎用过了
Yeah, and that side
seems to be used.

722
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,480
只要它不把我们带到树上去
As long as it doesn't
take us into that tree.

723
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,080
我可以加在你的辙痕上。
I could add to your dent.

724
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,680
我们弄的辙痕，我得同意。
WE made that dent! I have to agree.

725
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,920
哇，TMD！
Whoa, fucking hell!

726
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,800
观众们请原谅。
Pardon me, viewers.

727
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,240
这条路的最后几公里完全掉到
水里去了。
The last kilometre of this road
is completely submerged

728
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,200
但小伙子们终于挂着泥巴继续前行了。
but the boys are finally
getting the hang of mud driving.

729
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,480
这个是从窗户里进来的
It's coming in through the window.

730
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,040
你在做什么？
我只是沿着这条小径
What are you doing?
I'm just following the tracks.

731
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,600
哦，太神奇了。每次你认为玩完的时候
都没玩完。
Oh, that's fantastic. Every time
you think it's over, it's not over.

732
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,240
直到那个胖女士唱的时候才完。见鬼
It's not over till the fat woman
sings. Bloody hell!

733
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,960
真漂亮！
Beautiful!

734
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,160
走，走，，，，佛格！
Go, go, go. Go, Fogle!

735
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,200
走，走！
Go, go!

736
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,240
干得好，伙计，那太给力了
Well done, mate. That was fantastic.

737
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,240
是的。
Yes!

738
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,400
他们到达了一个小小的灰尘很大的城镇，
这个镇出现在80年代，以招待来此建筑
They have arrived in a small
dirt town that emerged in
the 1980s to house and feed

739
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,960
康士城的员工们的食宿
construction crews who came to
build the city of Constitucion.

740
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,600
为了揭秘这个新秘鲁首都之梦的究竟
To discover what happened to the
dream of a new Peruvian capital,

741
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,440
本和修来到了一个当地政府的办公室。
Ben and Hugh have come to
a local government office...

742
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,880
哦，戴维德！
Ah, David!

743
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,520
戴维德是一个导游和历史学家
..Where David Zevallos
is a guide and historian.

744
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,440
这是我们的前总统佛那多。
This is our ex-president,
Fernando Belaunde Terry.

745
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,040
他对我们来说是个非常重要的人，
他决定在丛林中间修建康士城，
He was a very important man for us
and he decided to build Constitucion
city in the middle of the jungle.

746
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,880
那么它打算建多大呢？
And how big was it going to be?

747
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,760
曾打算建成一个大城市，打算作为秘鲁的首都
It was going to be a big city. It
was going to be the capital of Peru.

748
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,600
你在这儿可以看见这个规划。
Here you can see the plans here.

749
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,320
这里我们有市民中心，商业中心，
Here we have the civic centre,
the commercial centre,

750
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,720
他打算为我们的市民建立这样的房屋
看看这个！
houses that he wanted to build like
this for our citizens. Look at that!

751
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,160
这是个宏大的工程，不是吗？
That is a massive project, isn't it?

752
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,600
看看这条路的数字！看上去像是条3行道
的高速公路
Look at the size of that road! That
looks like a triple-lane highway.

753
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,840
那么，为什么他要选择这个地方作为新
首都的地点呢
So, why did he choose here as
the location for the new capital?

754
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,400
他认为这个地方有战略意义
He thought it was a strategic place.

755
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,320
战略意义？
传略意义。
A strategic place? A strategic place.

756
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,200
是的，它在丛林的中心。
Yeah, it was the
centre of the jungle.

757
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,840
它很重要，但它最终什么也没有。
因为我们无法完成它
It was important
but it was nothing at the end,
because we couldn't finish that.

758
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,680
那么，到底出了什么状况？
So what went wrong?

759
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,080
哦，有太多的腐败
Well, there was a lot of corruption.

760
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,200
太多的人贪污钱财。
There was a lot of
people robbing money.

761
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,440
你对于这个状况没能解决而失望吗？
是的，当然。
Are you disappointed that this never
got off the ground? Yes, of course.

762
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:30,120
作为一个秘鲁人，
我对此很失望，因为很多人将会
在这里生活
As a Peruvian citizen,
I am disappointed for that because a
lot of people would be living there.

763
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,160
现在，它只是被遗忘在了丛林中间。
And now it's just forgotten in
the middle of the jungle.

764
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,040
但是你可以再这条路的尽头看见它
But you can see it at
the end of the road.

765
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,080
我们能看见这条路通往哪儿吗？
We can see where
this was going to be?

766
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,280
是的，它会出现在路的尽头。
Yes, it was going to be
at the end of the road.

767
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,520
谢谢。
Thanks very much. Muchos gracias.

768
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,880
不客气
You're welcome.

769
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,080
选为新首都的地址似乎在3KM之外。
The site chosen for the new capital
lies three kilometres away,

770
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,560
在秘鲁的地理位置正中心
at the exact geographical centre
of Peru.

771
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:01,840
B总统的远大理想是有一条贯穿丛林
的大道，通往新的城市
President Belaunde Terry's grand
vision was for a huge road through
the jungle, leading to the new city.

772
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,280
上千的土著人为此项目从他们的故土
搬迁来此
Thousands of indigenous
people were moved from
their land in preparation.

773
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,360
但是，今天，除了这条路，基本什么
都没剩下。
But, today,
little but the road remains.

774
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,720
那么，这条路也许就是全部了，我猜，
不是吗？
So, this would have all been
part of it, I guess, wouldn't it?

775
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,760
我们所行走的这条路也许就是那些规划的全部，
不是吗？
This road we're on now would have all
been part of those plans, isn't it?

776
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,360
那么，这个也许就像字面上说的，路的尽头
So this might be - literally -
the end of the road.

777
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,680
你其实不常得出那种观点
It's not often
you actually find that point.

778
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,920
那么，这其实是康士城所剩余的东西
So this is effectively what's left

779
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,320
of the city of Constitucion.

780
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,400
一个新城市仅仅在建了几栋房子
之后就被遗弃了，
The new city was abandoned
after only a few houses were built,

781
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,960
但是这里现在居住的是爱莎人-秘鲁
最大的土著部落
but it is now inhabited by members
of the Ashaninka people - the
largest indigenous tribe in Peru.

782
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,040
部落首领是72岁的艾丽西亚
The community is led by
72-year-old Alicia Arellano.

783
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,240
本说西班牙语
BEN SPEAKS SPANISH

784
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,560
艾丽西亚
Alicia.

785
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
修
Hugh.

786
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,160
那么，她已经在这里生活了23年了。
So she's been here for 23 years.

787
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,760
他们的B总统修建了这些建筑给他们居住
So that's President Belaunde created
these buildings they moved into.

788
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,200
他们不得不清扫全部，不得不再次返回丛林
So they had to clean it all. They
had to pull back the jungle again.

789
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,680
她来自丛林
So she is from the jungle.

790
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,320
她的族人来自丛林
Her people are from the jungle.

791
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,520
他们坚称他们几乎回到过去了，不是吗？
So it's kind of they claimed it back
almost, haven't they?

792
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,000
谢谢
Gracias. Gracias.

793
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,960
有个群落，一个相当大的群落，在这儿
There is a community -
a proper community here.

794
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,920
所有的这些建筑现在给那些被迫来此
建造新城市的族人居住。
And all these buildings are now
used by the tribes that were forced
off the land to build the city,

795
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,000
他们还坚称，还是相当令人满意的。
so they've reclaimed it, which
is rather satisfying in a way...

796
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,160
不是对B总统满意，但是我发现
相当令人满意。
not for President Belaunde but I
find that really rather satisfying.

797
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:11,040
我认为这个旅程，这条路，我们正在
走着的，经历了诸多的变迁。
I think this journey - this road
we've been on - has taken so many
twists and turns in every sense.

798
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,480
我觉得意料之中的是，结局就像我们
沿途所遇见的那些事情一样新奇。
It actually doesn't surprise me
that the ending has been just as

799
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,360
strange as everything
we've found along the way.

800
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,280
本和修到达了他们路程的终点，
现在可以返乡了。
Ben and Hugh have
reached the end of their journey
and can now head for home.

801
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,160
过去的这8天里，他们横穿了秘鲁
Over the last eight days, they
have driven right across Peru,

802
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,600
在世界最危险的道路之一，
生还并讲述这个故事。
on one of the world's
most dangerous roads,
and survived to tell the tale.

803
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,120
我们得以穿越安第斯，深入雨林。
We were able to travel from
the Andes, deep into the rainforest.

804
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,920
我认为你不会在世界的任何地方找到
一条这么多变的道路
I don't think you'll find a road
with quite such variety
anywhere in the world.

805
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,920
这是个难以置信的惊心动魄之举
It's an incredibly
impressive enterprise, actually.

806
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,920
第一，他们在第一个地方发现的事实
简直就是个奇迹，我认为，
One, the fact they've got it
in the first place, which is
almost a miracle, I think.

807
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,560
第二，他们让事实不断浮现出来，
并让人们相信可以克服一切，
And, secondly, the fact they are
constantly clearing it and making
sure people can get through.

808
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,200
这是一次信任感的体验，开着车，
驾驭这么珍贵的一个宝物，真的。
It's a huge trust experience to
take the wheel and be in charge of
quite a precious cargo, really.

809
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,440
也有些奇怪的事情，比如
“左转，左转，否则你会杀了我们”
There was the odd kind of,
"Steer left, steer left,
or you're going to kill us!"

810
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,040
可是我觉得足够了
But I think that's fair enough.

811
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,320
我觉得所有的那些刺激的时刻，
开心的时刻，
I think all of those stressful
moments, happy moments...

812
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,080
正是这些构成了这次的旅行。不是吗？
that's what creates
the journey, isn't it? It's what

813
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,040
这些就是紧密连接我们的东西
bonds you together.

814
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,800
当我撞了挡板，佛格先生，
When I hit the dashboard, Mr
Fogle...

815
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,480
我想让你急刹车
I'd like you to
do an emergency stop.

816
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,760
你为什么开车？
Why are you driving?

817
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,400
你不觉得原本应该我来开吗？
我没撞过桥。
Don't you think I should be driving?
I didn't crash into a bridge.

818
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,920
我没撞过牛，不是吗？
I didn't hit a cow, did I?

819
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,640
你开的太颠簸了，
Yours is too bumpy, your driving.

820
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,680
你似乎不能搞定那些转弯
You don't seem able to cope
with bends.

821
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,400
你还陷泥巴里去过
You got stuck in the mud!

822
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,920
你还陷泥巴里去过
You got stuck in the mud!

823
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,760
我们都陷泥巴里去过
We both got stuck in the mud.

注意车辆，出租车！
Mind the motor, taxi!
