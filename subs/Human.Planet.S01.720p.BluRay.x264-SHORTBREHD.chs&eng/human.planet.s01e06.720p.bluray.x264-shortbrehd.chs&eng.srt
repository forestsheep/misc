1
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:09,481
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:12,011
在地球的每一个角落都留下了印迹
in every habitat on earth.

3
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:15,831
那就是人类
That creature is us.

4
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:19,721
天地悠悠
All over the world,

5
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:24,721
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
we still use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

6
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,861
远离文明开化的城市
far from the city lights,

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,771
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

8
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,351
草本植物是一类非凡的植物
Grass is a remarkable plant.

9
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,311
它供养着不计其数的生命
It supports a great abundance of life.

10
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,841
小麦  水稻  大麦和玉米
Wheat, rice, barley and corn,

11
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,241
这些都属于草本植物
they're all grasses and they feed us,

12
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,161
它们是我们的主要粮食
and the grasslands feed the animals

13
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:09,091
并养育着供人类食用的动物们
that feed our world too.

14
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:16,401
我们在草原上的活动改变了地貌
Our lives on the grasslands have transformed the planet,

15
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,381
从美国辽阔的牧场
from the prairies of America

16
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:20,601
到中国的梯田
to the rice terraces of China.

17
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:26,121
但这绝非易事
But it's not been easy.

18
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:30,541
人类绞尽脑汁  鼓足勇气
It's taken every last ounce of human courage and ingenuity

19
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,571
才成为草原的统领
to become masters of the grasslands.

20
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:55,871
草原

21
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:55,871
力量之源

22
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,501
肯尼亚南部的大草原晨光微曦
Dawn on the Savannah in southern Kenya.

23
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:20,981
拉基塔和伙伴们已经等候多时
It's the moment Rakita and his mates have been waiting for.

24
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,701
长途迁徙的牛羚群终于到达
The wildebeest migration has arrived.

25
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,311
这里丰盈的水草
Here, lush grasses support

26
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,271
养育着世间最庞大的牧群
the largest herds of animals in the world.

27
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:39,231
这正是多罗博猎人们捕猎的好时机
A bounty of opportunity for these Dorobo hunters.

28
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:46,821
但要想获得这些待人宰割的猎物
But there's fierce competition for all this meat on the hoof

29
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,251
他们得和世间最高效的
from some of the world's

30
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,771
猎食动物展开残酷竞争
most efficient killers.

31
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,341
渺小的人类  没有獠牙和厉爪
So how do mere humans, without fangs or claws,

32
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,271
速度又远不及牛羚
who can't outrun a wildebeest,

33
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,201
要怎样才能分到一杯羹呢
get a meal around here?

34
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,951
拉基塔靠的是大脑和团队合作
Rakita uses brains and teamwork.

35
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,031
他要先让狮子们完成对牛羚的捕杀
His plan is to let the lions kill the wildebeest,

36
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:45,961
然后从它们眼皮底下把猎物偷走
then he'll steal their dinner from right under their noses.

37
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,091
他的两个朋友必不可少
His two friends are essential.

38
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:54,791
狮群可不会轻易被吓退
Lions aren't easily intimidated.

39
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,951
首先  拉基塔必须找到
First, Rakita must find

40
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,771
雄狮拖走尸体的踪迹
the tracks of a lion pride on the hunt.

41
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:06,611
沿着这条路走

42
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:12,831
65岁的拉基塔经验丰富  由他带头跟踪
At 65, he's a veteran hunter and takes the lead.

43
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,381
他们必须加倍小心
They must watch their backs -

44
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,381
因为他们已踏入食人猛兽的领地
this is man-eater territory.

45
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,331
豺狼在嚎叫...

46
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,631
因为狮群就在附近

47
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:45,741
所有迹象表明附近一场杀戮刚刚结束
All the signs point to a fresh kill nearby.

48
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,451
你觉得它们在这吗

49
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,941
是的  我能看到它们了  就在那

50
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,491
拉基塔曾被狮群袭击过
Rakita's been attacked by lions before.

51
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,691
他知道后果不堪设想
He knows this could end badly.

52
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,241
这种时候你只感觉浑身紧绷...

53
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:35,091
...心怦怦作响

54
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,691
他们面对的是15只饥肠辘辘的狮子
They're up against 15 hungry lions,

55
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,111
但如果他们齐心合力
but, if they act as one,

56
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,071
他们就可能把狮群
they might just intimidate the lions

57
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:51,371
从猎物的尸体边吓走
and push them off their kill.

58
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,261
他们行动了
They make their move.

59
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,551
自信是最重要的部分
Self-confidence is everything.

60
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,411
这是一场终极的对峙
This is the ultimate face-off.

61
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,481
突然间  狮群退却了
Suddenly, the lions back off.

62
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,921
在狮子意识到这只是虚张声势之前
Rakita has just minutes

63
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,201
拉基塔只有几分钟的时间
before the lions realise it's a bluff.

64
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,871
大约几秒钟以后
In a matter of seconds,

65
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,861
他割下了牛羚的一条大腿
he butchers the haunch of the wildebeest,

66
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,221
然后他们迅速地撤离了
and they beat a hasty retreat.

67
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,231
直到你偷到了食物...

68
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:09,381
而且没有人受伤...

69
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,741
...你才能够放松下来

70
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,841
...并为此感到愉快

71
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:29,201
这是人类自古以来
This is a scene which has played out

72
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,151
以弱胜强的真实写照
throughout human existence,

73
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,561
捕猎时他们用的是脑子而非蛮力
hunters using brains, not brawn,

74
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,021
从而智取他们强大的对手
to outwit their mighty competitors.

75
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,531
我们着实打劫了狮子们一把

76
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,061
你觉得那有多少只狮子呢

77
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:48,581
十五只或者更多吧

78
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,491
但不是每个人都敢与狮子对抗...

79
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:53,871
...有些人就是怕死的懦夫

80
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:02,671
挂着的肉让洞穴更有家的气息了

81
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:25,431
利用别的动物来为你捕猎的确高明
Getting another animal to do the killing for you is clever,

82
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:29,051
但亲自操刀捕猎则是更大的挑战
but making the kill yourself is an even bigger challenge.

83
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,121
在非洲大陆的另一端
At the other end of Africa,

84
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,321
在喀拉哈里沙漠的边缘
on the edge of the Kalahari Desert,

85
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:40,061
有一片更为干燥的草原
lies a much drier grassland,

86
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,911
这里的动物要稀少得多
supporting far fewer animals.

87
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:46,501
这儿可没有免费的午餐
There's no free lunch here.

88
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:53,111
昆和纳奥是永豪西族[音译]布须曼人
!Kun and N//ao are Ju/'hoansi bushmen.

89
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,001
昆是猎手头领
!Kun is a master hunter,

90
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,091
他是永豪西族人中少数几个
one of a handful of Ju'hoansi

91
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,311
依然掌握着捕猎大猎物的本领的人
who still have the skills to hunt big game.

92
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,051
昆在指导他的徒弟
So !Kun is teaching his apprentice

93
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,721
让这种宝贵的技能得以流传
to keep this precious knowledge alive.

94
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:18,241
这场捕猎开始于生一把大火
The hunt begins by kindling fire.

95
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,101
他们把唯一的泉眼周围
They burn the grass from around

96
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,041
几公里的草木全部烧掉
the only waterhole for many kilometres.

97
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,831
他们知道动物们最终会来这里找水喝
They know the animals will ultimately come to drink here

98
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,191
等到那时
and when they do,

99
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:43,731
它们便无处藏身
they'll have nowhere to hide.

100
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:52,631
他们的弓箭太小  无法一击致命
Their bows and dart arrows are too small to kill outright,

101
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:55,271
所以他们改良了武器
so they refine their weapons.

102
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:02,201
猎手头领昆很清楚去哪里寻找毒药
!Kun, the master, knows exactly where to find poison.

103
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,591
在这板结的沙土里有种甲虫的幼虫
Within this hardened sand shell is a beetle grub.

104
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:13,841
只要一滴虫汁渗入哪怕最微小的伤口
If just one drop of beetle juice gets into the tiniest cut,

105
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,381
也会令其一命呜呼
it will kill him.

106
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:19,681
他小心翼翼地把它涂在箭尖
He anoints his arrows with great care.

107
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,801
但他们的猎物同样狡猾
But their prey are wily too,

108
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,091
于是他们搭了一个草棚
so they build a grass hide.

109
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,261
在那里设下埋伏
This is an ambush.

110
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,661
昆希望他的徒弟能抓住
!Kun wants his apprentice

111
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,241
属于自己的第一只羚羊
to get his first kudu.

112
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:46,171
看来它们在来了

113
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:49,311
走近了吗

114
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,391
这种羚羊有着敏锐的听觉和锐利的眼睛
The antelope's acute hearing and sharp eyes

115
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,481
意味着他必须悄无声息且不能被看见
mean he must learn to move silently and without being seen.

116
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,871
可是纳奥还是暴露了
But N//ao has been spotted.

117
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,491
机会失之交臂
The moment is lost.

118
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:14,571
你得边看边学

119
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,381
条纹羚诡计多端

120
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:22,541
...你不能让它看到你的脸

121
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,411
两天过后
Two days later,

122
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:30,031
这两个布须曼人还潜伏在那里
the bushmen are still in their hide,

123
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:33,501
等待羚羊们的干渴战胜恐惧
hoping that the kudus' thirst will overcome their fear.

124
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,401
可它们却迟迟不来
But they stay away.

125
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:42,331
连头领也措手不及的是
Then even the master is caught unprepared.

126
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:46,271
一只美洲豹突然出现
It's a leopard.

127
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,231
猛然间猎手变成猎物
Suddenly the hunters risk becoming the hunted.

128
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:59,611
美洲豹的咬合力足以嚼碎人类的脑壳
A leopard's jaws have the power to crush a human skull.

129
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:29,231
他们不停地祈祷猎豹没有看到他们
They're praying the leopard hasn't seen them.

130
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,871
纳奥趴在阴影里
N//ao lies low in the shadows.

131
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:45,491
这次他们终于没被发现
This time they've managed to remain undetected.

132
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:56,991
今天是潜伏的第六天了
It's day six in the hide,

133
00:12:56,991 --> 00:13:00,241
徒弟至今无法靠近他的猎物
and the apprentice is no closer to getting a meal.

134
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,791
又一群条纹羚来了
A new group of kudu come in.

135
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:10,821
他们抓住这次机会
They've got one chance.

136
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,601
两个人都上满了弓
Both men raise their bows.

137
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,011
正中靶心
Bull's-eye!

138
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,581
一发中的  羚羊纷纷四散逃开
An arrow has hit home and the kudu scatter.

139
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,421
射得漂亮

140
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:34,371
我的天呐  确实射得非常准

141
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,591
受伤的条纹羚会带着毒箭
The injured kudu will run for many kilometres

142
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,361
继续奔跑出好几公里
with the poison arrow in its flank,

143
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,251
毒素在它体内缓慢地产生作用
as the toxins slowly take effect.

144
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:47,991
追逐就此开始
The pursuit begins.

145
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,271
首先他们要找到箭杆
First, they must find the arrow shaft.

146
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,291
它能指示出追踪的方向
It will show them which tracks to follow

147
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,841
并能确定是谁射中了猎物
and also who made the hit.

148
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,421
找到箭杆了

149
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,721
这是你的箭

150
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,951
是的  就是你的

151
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:08,701
你射中了你的第一支条纹羚  太棒了

152
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,091
希望毒药能有作用

153
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,141
会有用的

154
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,081
它好像往那个方向跑了

155
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:20,641
从现在开始  剩下的就只有追寻了
From here on, it's all about tracking.

156
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:24,951
地面上羚羊的脚印纵横交错
The ground is criss-crossed with hoof prints.

157
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,161
走错方向意味着一切将徒劳无功
The wrong decision will mean a wild-goose chase.

158
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,391
看  它在这撒了泡尿

159
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,521
能看得出来  毒素在起作用了

160
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:50,081
我们肯定能杀了那只羚羊

161
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,541
追寻途中
While tracking,

162
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,381
猎人们通过察看猎物留下的痕迹
the hunters look at the landscape

163
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,591
一路追踪着猎物
through the eyes of their prey.

164
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:20,581
十小时后  他们终于赶上了那只羚羊
After ten hours, they finally catch up with the kudu.

165
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,691
毒素让它变得虚弱了
The poison has weakened it.

166
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:34,751
它已经筋疲力尽  几近死亡
She's exhausted, near death.

167
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,911
纳奥将矛扎进它的心脏
N//ao aims a spear to the heart

168
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,851
迅速地结果了它
to deliver a swift end.

169
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,811
七天后
After seven days,

170
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:16,151
纳奥最终杀了他的第一只羚羊
N//ao has finally killed his first kudu.

171
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,871
现在世间又多了一个能做到这个的人了
Now there is one more person in the world who can do this.

172
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:26,671
他们搬回去的肉将能养活整个村子
The meat they'll carry home will feed their whole village.

173
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:30,111
且这只动物的每个部位都会被利用起来
And every part of the animal will be put to use.

174
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:36,351
这片焦土看似死地
This burnt landscape looks dead,

175
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,501
但野草的生命力是难以置信的顽强
but grass is incredibly resilient.

176
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,381
下第一场雨的时候  草又再生了
With the first drops of rain, it regenerates.

177
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,821
在雨水泛滥成河泽的地方
And where these rains become floods,

178
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:53,311
草长的速度和水位上升并驾齐驱
grass grows to keep pace with the rising waters.

179
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:57,551
在世界各地
Around the world,

180
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,951
有很多草原经历着如此极端的季节变化
many grasslands undergo such extreme seasonal changes,

181
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,451
这带来新的机遇
bringing new opportunities,

182
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,551
也暗藏着危险
but also lurking dangers.

183
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,661
在柬埔寨
In Cambodia,

184
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:17,001
洞里萨湖周围的草原成为泽国
the grasslands around Tonle Sap lake are flooding...

185
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,951
在短短的几周内
...and for a few short weeks

186
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,151
那儿的猎物垂手可得
there are rich pickings to be had.

187
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:28,031
这是瓦纳大捞一笔的好机会
It's Vaana's big chance to make a killing.

188
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,441
他来这里捕猎一种无法预料的
He's here to hunt an unexpected,

189
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,961
隐秘并且可能置人于死地的野生猛兽
hidden and potentially fatal wild prey.

190
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,931
我在小船上的时候

191
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:44,331
...想知道黑色的水里有什么

192
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,811
...我很为我的孩子担心

193
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,231
瓦纳的捕猎技术在于识别
Vaana's hunting skill lies in recognising

194
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:08,521
普通的和危险的猎物
the difference between an easy meal and a deadly catch.

195
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,671
但是他寻找的不是鱼
But it's not fish he's after.

196
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,651
而是蛇
It's snakes.

197
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,711
在这片水草地里有无数条蛇
There are many millions of them in this flooded grassland.

198
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:32,401
绝大部分是可食用的水蛇
Most are edible water snakes

199
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,171
但是却是毒蛇
but some are venomous.

200
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,931
如果抓起来的是条眼镜蛇
If he pulls up a cobra,

201
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,361
那他就可能会被咬死
its bite could kill him.

202
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,701
这就像一场俄罗斯轮盘游戏
It's a game of Russian roulette.

203
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:53,111
连他五岁的儿子都必须成为蛇类专家
Even his five-year-old son has to be a snake expert,

204
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,611
能准确识别蛇的种类才可以在这里生存
knowing which is which means survival here.

205
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,861
蛇在这里大量聚集
The snakes gather in these huge numbers

206
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:05,221
去追捕那些在水草中产卵的鱼
to hunt the fish which spawn in the submerged grass.

207
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:18,031
没时间讲卫生了
It's no time to be squeamish.

208
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,641
每跑掉一条都是瓦纳的损失
Every escapee sees Vaana's profits slither away.

209
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,801
我们今天抓了很多蛇

210
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,701
瓦纳的整个家庭都得设法对付蛇
Vaana's whole family must get to grips with snakes.

211
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:41,111
给这女儿一条活蛇玩玩

212
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,091
对孩子们来说
For the kids,

213
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:48,611
它们是很受欢迎的新玩具
they are welcome new toys.

214
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,771
爸爸  我可以再要一条吗

215
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,841
妈妈  看  它咬了我的脚

216
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,421
不  它正盯着你的蛋蛋

217
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,601
它正盯着你的蛋蛋

218
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:19,091
它正想进那里去

219
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,231
瓦纳捕的蛇就是卖到
Vaana's catch is destined

220
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,881
这个世界上最大的蛇类市场
for the biggest snake market in the world.

221
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:35,431
几周内有超过六百万条蛇在这里转手
Over 6 million snakes change hands in a matter of weeks.

222
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,811
我想卖每公斤五千瑞尔[约人民币8元]

223
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:49,171
四千怎么样

224
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:52,941
好吧  四千瑞尔全拿走

225
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,381
他跟蛇斗争一周的报酬
His payment for a week's snake wrangling...

226
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,781
注: 1英镑=100便士  约为6540柬埔寨瑞尔

227
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,781
60便士
60p.

228
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,221
别数了  把它放好

229
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:23,071
但在草原生存靠的不仅仅是捕猎
But survival in the grasslands isn't all about hunting.

230
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,361
在东非  马塞族人
In East Africa, the Masai

231
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,451
已经学会了怎样同一种野生鸟合作
have learnt how to collaborate with a wild bird

232
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:36,791
只有通过合作他们才能吃到一种甜点
to get a sweet treat they can only get if they work together.

233
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:45,801
莱塔托正在用哨声吸引一只向蜜鸟
Leitato is whistling to attract a honey guide.

234
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,591
这种鸟正如其名
It's a bird that is aptly named.

235
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,991
向蜜鸟用它仅对人会才发出的叫声
The honey guide answers their whistles

236
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,031
回应了他们的哨声
with a call it only uses to talk to humans.

237
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,461
它在那儿  它在那儿

238
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:18,101
它一闻到他们所寻找的食物的味道
She starts a game of Follow My Leader...

239
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,811
就玩起了"学领袖"游戏[一种儿童游戏]
...since only she can smell the food they're after.

240
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,981
当它靠近目标的时候
When she's close to the prize,

241
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:36,651
就会改变叫声
she changes her call,

242
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,851
让人们知道快到了
letting them know they're getting hotter.

243
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:52,811
在这儿  哇

244
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,721
这下孩子们走运了  有一个蜂窝
The boys have hit the jackpot - a beehive.

245
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,661
向蜜鸟的任务完成了
The bird's job is done.

246
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,161
站在哪里最好呢

247
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,201
就是那儿

248
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,641
好吧  我们点堆火吧

249
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:14,631
现在他们开始履行交易中他们的部分
Now they have to fulfil their part of the bargain -

250
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:16,391
把蜂蜜弄出来
getting the honey out.

251
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,521
蜂蜜藏在树的深处
It's hidden deep in the tree

252
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:25,911
被几百只愤怒的非洲蜜蜂保护着
protected by hundreds of angry African bees.

253
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:33,631
他们用烟熏使蜂群平静下来
They use smoke to calm them.

254
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,431
但这并不能减轻被蜂蛰到的疼楚
But it doesn't make the stings any less painful.

255
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:54,971
我太小了  够不着

256
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:59,791
孩子们知道他们必须回馈向导
The boys know they have to pay their guide.

257
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,661
把蜂房和一些蜜蜂幼虫留给它
Honeycomb with added grubs.

258
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:14,371
真好吃  真甜

259
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,811
我们去哪里可以找到更多

260
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,061
真是完美的合作关系
It's the perfect partnership,

261
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:21,901
但是  每个马塞族男孩都知道
but, as every Masai boy knows,

262
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:24,431
要是你不给向蜜鸟报酬
if you don't give the honey guide its reward,

263
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,831
下次它就会把你带到狮子窝去
next time it will lead you to a lion's den!

264
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:38,071
我们已经学会如何在野生草原寻找食物
So we've learnt how to find food in the wild grasslands,

265
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,071
依靠自己
either on our own,

266
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:41,551
或者从其他生物那儿获得点帮助
or with a bit of help from others.

267
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:47,551
但在学会如何开发草原本身时
But our mastery of the grasslands took a huge leap forward

268
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:51,201
我们对草原的掌控又来了个大飞跃
when we learnt how to exploit the grass itself.

269
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:59,251
小麦  玉米和大米最初都是野草
Wheat, maize and rice all started life as wild grasses,

270
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,431
被我们培育成农作物
which we've bred into crops.

271
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:11,091
这让我们每年可以养活成千上万的人
This has enabled us to feed millions of people every year,

272
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,841
于是  我们在田地边安顿了下来
and so we've settled down and

273
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:15,371
建立起了家园
built homes beside our fields.

274
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,021
但这些人类创造的丰富产物
But this man-made abundance is irresistible

275
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,271
让被称为害虫的动物们欲罢不能
to many animals we now call pests.

276
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,401
在非洲平原
On the African plains

277
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:37,591
这些谷物杀手泛滥成灾
these cereal killers come in plague proportions.

278
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:45,871
艾什尔住在坦桑尼亚
Isiah lives in Tanzania.

279
00:25:45,871 --> 00:25:48,761
他的大米就快收割了
His rice harvest is just days away,

280
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:52,021
但他知道一场虫灾即将来袭
but he knows an aerial attack is imminent.

281
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:56,301
它们三月会来

282
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:01,341
它们要吃  我也要吃  但它们会吃光一切

283
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:04,571
他必须警觉
He must be vigilant,

284
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,241
时刻密切关注他害怕听到的声音
ever alert to the sound he dreads.

285
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,361
首先听到的是噪音
The noise comes first...

286
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:20,221
然后是先头部队
...then the advance party...

287
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,791
后面跟着密密麻麻一大群
...followed by the swarm.

288
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:31,081
它们是奎利亚雀
They are quelea.

289
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,941
数以百万计地结伴飞来
They come in their millions

290
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:35,781
人们称之为"蝗鸟"
and people call them locust birds.

291
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,921
它们是地球上数量最多的鸟类
They are the most numerous bird species on Earth,

292
00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:56,191
贪嗜谷物
ravenous for grain.

293
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:06,331
艾什尔和他的邻居们
Isiah and his neighbours

294
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:08,731
必须努力阻止它们停留
must try to prevent the quelea from settling,

295
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,041
否则鸟群会在一小时内吃光他们的谷物
otherwise the flock will strip their crop in an hour.

296
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:19,721
这场战争他是不可能胜利的
It's not a battle he can win,

297
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,021
他能做的只是尽量减少损失而已
it's about limiting his losses.

298
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,501
种子成熟的时候
As the seeds ripen,

299
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:32,571
这些迁徙的鸟群从来不会停在一个地方
these migrant flocks never stand still.

300
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:35,611
但它们有个致命弱点
But they do have an Achilles heel.

301
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,801
为了繁衍  它们必须停下来
In order to breed, the quelea must stop,

302
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:42,911
密密麻麻地编织无数的巢
weaving thousands of nests in tight colonies.

303
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:48,611
这是农民们报复的良机
This is the farmers' chance to strike back.

304
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,761
就在多数鸟都去觅食的时候
While most of the flock is away feeding,

305
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:03,061
他们放置了致命的陷阱
a deadly trap is laid.

306
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,281
黄昏来临时  鸟群回巢了
The birds return as dusk falls.

307
00:28:56,741 --> 00:28:58,901
迄今  在与害虫们的竞赛中
So far, we're one step ahead

308
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:01,231
我们占了先手
in the arms race with the pests.

309
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:05,131
我们驾驭草原的能力
And our ability to manipulate the grasslands

310
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:07,791
也越来越强大了
has gone from strength to strength.

311
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:14,281
我们有这些超大型的人造草原
We have supersized these man-made grasslands...

312
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,881
改造群山  砍伐森林
...sculpting mountains, felling forests

313
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:22,011
重新设计我们星球的每块表面
and redesigning the very surface of our planet.

314
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:29,651
七块草地可以养活几乎七十亿人
Seven grasses feed almost seven billion people.

315
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,841
它们供给我们所需糖类的四分之三
They supply three-quarters of our carbohydrates,

316
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,991
还有面包和意面  面条和粥
bread and pasta, noodles and porridge.

317
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:49,321
这些人造大平原正在制造野生草原
These artificial great plains are making wild grasslands

318
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,531
其中有地球上濒危的栖息地
amongst the most endangered habitats on Earth.

319
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,081
然而正是在这养育了
Yet it was on the wild grasslands,

320
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,441
大量畜牧的野生草原上
which support vast grazing herds,

321
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:04,741
我们获得了或许是最大的成功
that we achieved perhaps our greatest triumph...

322
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:08,441
按照我们的需要征服了这些动物
to subjugate these animals to our needs.

323
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:12,841
控制一种植物是一回事
Controlling a plant is one thing,

324
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:16,161
但要支配一种动物并符合其自由意愿
but dominating a creature with its own free will

325
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:19,601
则需要更高水准的驾驭能力
requires a far higher level of manipulation.

326
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:27,241
蒙古大草原是地球上最大的草原
The Mongolian steppe is the biggest grassland on Earth.

327
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,651
在这里奔跑着
There are more horses running wild here

328
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:32,931
世界上最多的马
than anywhere else in the world.

329
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,701
蒙古人高超的驯马能力
The Mongols' ability to tame horses

330
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:44,321
让这些游牧民成了大草原的主宰
has made these nomads masters of the steppe.

331
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,151
在一个牧马家庭里
And, in a family of horsemen,

332
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,441
乌拉纳是最出色的
Ulaana is the best.

333
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:55,641
他的骑术是流淌在血液里的
He's got riding in his blood.

334
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:57,481
他的祖先成吉思汗
His ancestor Genghis Khan

335
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,461
用马的力量建立起了一个帝国
used horse power to build an empire,

336
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,541
但今天
but today,

337
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:04,921
乌拉纳的家族面临着一个不同的挑战
Ulaana's family face a different challenge.

338
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,261
他们必须利用马的速度
They must use their horses' speed

339
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:16,421
和耐力去捕捉野生母马
and stamina to capture wild mares.

340
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,191
把野马群赶回蒙古包
Driving the wild herd back

341
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:27,821
只是一天的开始
to the ger camp is only the beginning of a day

342
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:31,681
乌拉纳敏捷和力量的极限将受到考验
that will test Ulaana's agility and strength to the limit.

343
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,501
我骑马的时候觉得很有活力

344
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:40,701
他的终极目标是马奶
Ultimately he's after the mare's milk,

345
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:43,001
但这并不容易
but it's not that straightforward.

346
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:57,081
这些野母马不会轻易地交出奶水
These wild mares don't give up their milk easily.

347
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,361
只有通过诱骗它们才行
They have to be tricked into it.

348
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:01,811
他的成功将取决于
His success will depend on

349
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:04,081
他与胯下的马能否默契配合
total partnership with his horse.

350
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:18,101
一匹善于追逐的马会知道我的目标

351
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,631
并紧紧跟在那匹马后

352
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,781
首先  乌拉纳要用套索套住小马驹
First, Ulaana lassoes the foals,

353
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:27,681
这样母马们就不会跑远
so the mares will stay close.

354
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:30,041
不过就算是小马驹也很倔强
But even the foals are feisty.

355
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:38,881
乌拉纳斜胯在马的一侧
Ulaana leans behind his horse,

356
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:40,941
利用它的力量和体重
using its strength and weight

357
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:42,821
来抵挡小马驹的牵拉
to resist the pull of the foal.

358
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:50,981
他必须在疾驰中
He must balance at a gallop,

359
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,851
仅靠双膝来保持平衡
using only his knees.

360
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,521
一旦他抓到一头小马
Once he's caught a foal,

361
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:12,551
他的表姐妹唐加立即给它戴上笼头
his cousin Tungaa must get a halter on

362
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:13,281
以防逃脱
before it escapes.

363
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:18,241
这是野马们第一次感受到人类的抚摸
It is the first time they have felt the touch of a human hand.

364
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,871
小马一旦被拴起来
Once they're tethered,

365
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:25,321
乌拉纳就可以追捕那些母马了
Ulaana can move on to the mares.

366
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,421
这时才是真正的战斗
This is the real battle -

367
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:32,601
母马的体重是他的五倍
mares are five times his weight.

368
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:43,221
给它逃走了  居然没抓住

369
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:53,051
不行  一头都捉不住

370
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:56,481
它们很善于逃出套索

371
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:00,681
古拉纳倾尽全力的同时
With Ulaana at full stretch,

372
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,181
大家也都伸出了援手
everyone lends a hand.

373
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:38,821
在几近精疲力尽的两小时后
After two exhausting hours,

374
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:41,291
人类终于开始占了上风
the men begin to get the upper hand.

375
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:53,561
这头母马被套上缰绳  腿也被捆了起来
Haltered and hobbled,

376
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:55,011
终于屈服了
this mare is finally subdued.

377
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:01,081
之后他们将小马驹还给它  以稳定情绪
Then they're left to calm down with their foals.

378
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:07,851
只有给小马喂奶时  母马才会释放乳汁
Only with the foal suckling will the mare let down her milk

379
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,031
这时唐加才能乘隙而入
and then Tungaa has a brief chance

380
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:12,071
为家里挤点马奶
to draw some off for the family.

381
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:23,531
不过蒙古人更喜欢再做些加工
But Mongolians prefer their milk with a twist.

382
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,331
他们的创新之处就在于
Their innovation has been to ferment

383
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,641
将这种甜甜的马奶发酵成奶酒
this sugary milk into airag,

384
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,401
就是一种含有少量酒精的酸奶
a slightly alcoholic yoghurt.

385
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:40,291
接下来换你来搅拌  然后换你  轮流来

386
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,771
乳酸菌把牛奶发酵成了
The yoghurt bacteria turns the milk

387
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:47,561
他们最有营养的夏日美味
into their most nutritious summer food.

388
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,851
搅拌得越多越好

389
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:05,051
这样才能做出新鲜冒泡的奶酒

390
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,231
你喝起来就像那些渴死的奶牛

391
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,761
只要不伤害这些动物
Without harming their animals,

392
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:29,711
乌拉纳家可以年年依赖它们
Ulaana's family can live off them year after year,

393
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,641
把野草转变成酸奶
turning the goodness of grass into yoghurt

394
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,311
但作为生活与食草牧群紧密相连的
but, having bound their lives to the grazing herds,

395
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,071
游牧民族
they are nomads,

396
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,641
他们要一直跟着牧群
following the herds on their perpetual search

397
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:42,201
不断寻找新的牧场
for fresh pastures.

398
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:53,111
动物们知道如何寻找到最肥美的草

399
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:57,901
这是它们的本能

400
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:03,661
所以我们就跟随它们的脚步

401
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,681
在其他文明中
In other cultures,

402
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:23,441
这种对于牧群的驾驭又上了一个台阶
we have taken this mastery a step further,

403
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,041
我们可以驯服并培育野生牧群
taming and breeding the wild herds,

404
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,851
让它们更加易于掌控
making them docile and easy to handle.

405
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,601
在非洲的大草原
In the African savannah,

406
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,481
牧民们把牛群看得很紧
herders keep their cattle close.

407
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,161
它们已经有了主人
They are owned now

408
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:38,261
和所有的私人财产一样
and, like property owners everywhere,

409
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,611
主人们会为保卫资产而战
men will fight to protect them.

410
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:46,711
在埃塞俄比亚南部的草原上
In the grasslands of southern Ethiopia,

411
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:50,321
苏里族人将这种捍卫表现到了极致
the Suri take this protection to extremes.

412
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:56,521
部落间甚至会为了牛群而大动干戈
Here, rival tribes even fight battles over cattle.

413
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,991
所以苏里族人必须个个都是战士
So Suri herders must become warriors.

414
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,471
为了捍卫自己的牲口
Shahuri will stop at nothing

415
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:10,131
希哈里可以不惜一切
to defend his herd.

416
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:17,111
我会为了我的牛群奋战到死

417
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:21,591
牛群就是我的全部

418
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:25,171
从儿时起就是这样了

419
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:31,041
在苏里族中  牛是通用货币
For the Suri, cattle are currency.

420
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,751
太贵重了  他们是不舍得屠宰的
Too valuable to kill,

421
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,981
而是尽心尽力地照顾它们
they care for them intimately.

422
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:40,651
我们给牛群生火取暖

423
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:46,921
每年希哈里都要参加一项传统的争勇比赛
Every year Shahuri must undergo a ritual trial of courage

424
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:50,361
来证明他够格当一名牛群斗士
to prove he's got what it takes to be a cattle warrior.

425
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,771
他直接饮用
He gets strength for the combat

426
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:58,081
自己奶牛身上的血
ahead directly from his cows

427
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,081
来获得格斗的力量
by drinking their blood.

428
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:02,101
也许这看起来有些残忍
It may look brutal,

429
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,561
但还不至于伤牛性命
but it doesn't kill them.

430
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,541
这些营养丰富的血液提供了希哈里
This rich blood gives Shahuri

431
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,361
很多重要的蛋白质和铁元素
essential protein and iron,

432
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:15,491
他那头珍贵的母牛也会很快康复
and his prize animal will recover quickly.

433
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,781
喝生血会让我们更强壮

434
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,801
这场名叫"当加"的传统比赛
The vicious ritual of Donga

435
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,281
对希哈里的牛仔声名而言
will make or break

436
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,681
成败就在此一举
Shahuri's reputation as a cowboy.

437
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:36,561
审判之日终于来临
It's the day of judgment.

438
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:38,921
几支苏里族的竞争部落
The rival Suri clans arrive,

439
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,061
兴奋地抵达赛场  各就各位
psyched up and ready for Donga.

440
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,661
这场竞赛要持续一天
It lasts a day.

441
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:53,481
你从邻村人中
You pick an opponent

442
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,551
选择一名对手对决
from the neighbouring village for a duel.

443
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:57,571
赢得的场次越多
The more victories you win,

444
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:59,541
就越能彰显你的勇气
the greater your courage.

445
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,521
希哈里走进格斗场地
Shahuri walks to the ring.

446
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:10,511
敢来参加比赛就已经要很大勇气了
Even taking part in this ritual takes serious guts.

447
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,111
而他甚至都没戴护甲
He has no armour.

448
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:16,321
仅有的防护就是他的幸运遮阳帽
His only defence is a lucky sunhat.

449
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,861
希哈里静候时机
Shahuri watches and waits.

450
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:47,221
"当加"比赛中的棍子长达两米
The Donga sticks are two metres long.

451
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:49,641
能引起严重的损伤
They can cause serious injury.

452
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,291
要赢的话
To win,

453
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,971
你必须连续抽打你的对手
you must thrash your opponent

454
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,041
直到他投降
until surrender.

455
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:07,901
终于  希哈里准备上场了
Finally, Shahuri is ready for battle.

456
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,171
他赢了  但说服力还不够
It's a victory, but not emphatic.

457
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,091
为了证明自己  他再次上场
To prove himself, he fights again.

458
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:42,401
突然他的对手退下场去
Suddenly his opponent backs down.

459
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,761
希哈里是最后的赢家
Shahuri is the champion.

460
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:59,911
他的同族们将他高高举起  庆祝胜利
Lifted high, his clan celebrate his victory.

461
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:06,381
我在"当加"比赛中非常英勇

462
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:08,771
在捍卫我的牛群时也很英勇

463
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:12,721
他的牛群终于有了守卫者
His cattle have their protector.

464
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:15,701
希哈里证明了自己是个够格的
Shahuri has proved he can be a cowboy,

465
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,441
"埃塞俄比亚牛仔"
Ethiopian style.

466
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:26,871
然而  在澳大利亚内陆
But in the Australian outback,

467
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,891
人们重新诠释了牛仔的含义
they've reinvented the cowboy big time.

468
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,581
这里的超级大农场
Here, supersized ranches

469
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:35,881
横跨全国  拥有三千多万头牛
across the country hold 30 million cattle.

470
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,481
这是人类对野兽彻彻底底的征服
This is the total mastery of man over beast,

471
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:43,721
体现了我们在草原上聪敏巧思的极致
our ultimate ingenuity in the grasslands.

472
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:50,481
在这里转上一圈曾经要一个月
Round-up used to take a month.

473
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,081
现在不会了
Not any more.

474
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,521
本・塔普是牧群领航员
Ben Tapp is a muster pilot,

475
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:09,421
他必须在五天内把他最好的
and he must bring in 2,000 of

476
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:13,021
两千头牛赶去卖掉
his best cattle in just five days to get paid.

477
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:17,481
他必须运用他所有的飞行技巧
He'll need all his flying skills,

478
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:19,331
以及读懂牛群心思的能力
his ability to read the cattle,

479
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,411
还有同伴兰金的帮助才能成功
and his mate Rankin, if he's to succeed.

480
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:32,841
如果你能理解牛群
If you can understand the cattle,

481
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:36,331
你就能预料到它们的动向
you can already anticipate what they're going to do.

482
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:37,941
如同一个优秀的牧牛人
Like a good cattleman,

483
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,901
你能认出每一头牛
you can identify every single beast,

484
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,201
每一头都不一样
and every single beast is different.

485
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:45,251
他的牛群就在不远处
His cattle are out there somewhere.

486
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:49,121
在空中侦察可以让本迅速定位
Scouting by air allows Ben to home in on them fast.

487
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:58,781
这条线上大概有六到七头牛
It appears there's about six or seven of them along the line.

488
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:01,341
当他们找到牛群时
When they find a group of cows,

489
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,741
他们会降低到"死亡高度"
they drop down to the "Death zone"

490
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,141
将它们驱赶出来
to flush them out.

491
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:07,951
只要刮到树木都将是致命的
Clipping any tree will be fatal.

492
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,181
别逼得太紧
Don't put too much pressure on them.

493
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,691
它们现在很紧张
They're fairly hot now.

494
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:19,771
跟紧那头掉队的就行
Just stick with that mob there.

495
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,281
让它们继续这样走
Keep them going that way.

496
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:26,921
你来跟紧它们  坏小子在这里
You stick with them. Oh, here's this mob here.

497
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:31,121
总是有那么些制造麻烦的牛
There are always some trouble-makers.

498
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,281
我们又有大概150头牛加入行列
We've got another...probably 150 coming in.

499
00:45:04,481 --> 00:45:07,261
摩托车也一同工作  帮助驱赶牛群
The choppers work together, pushing the growing herd,

500
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,351
不过他们还有五十公里要走
but they've got 50 kilometres and billabongs

501
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:12,211
在到达农场前  还要横渡洼地
to cross before they get to the ranch.

502
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,641
本的牛群实在不太喜欢游泳
Ben's cattle really don't like swimming.

503
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:26,851
只要它们准备好下水  无论哪里
Anywhere here, where they're ready to cross,

504
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,581
我们都直接让它们过河
we'll just let them go.

505
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,341
当心了
Oh, look out, look out!

506
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:44,151
每年都有约十名领航员坠地着火丧生
Every year, about ten muster pilots crash and burn.

507
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:49,491
稳住了
Just steady up there.

508
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:52,801
-它们正往前走  -是的
- They just work along... - Yeah.

509
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:54,551
还剩八公里时
From eight kilometres out,

510
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,081
地面人员也加入了驱赶的队伍
the ground crew joins the drive.

511
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:00,641
我想我们应该往南偏一点
I think we'll target a little bit southward.

512
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,841
往这边来  都到齐了吗
Come around. Everyone's here, right?

513
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:05,361
本还在发号施令
But Ben's still calling the shots.

514
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:08,601
摩托车跟上
Oh, the motorbike follows. Come on!

515
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:14,921
快点  摩托车赶快跟上
Come on, motorbike! Motorbike follow, come on!

516
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:19,801
快点  它们要往那边去了
Hurry up! They're going to go that way!

517
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:26,411
让它们继续保持这个方向前进
Keep them going the way they are heading there now.

518
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,521
如今  我们再也不用等待
Now, we don't need to wait

519
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:44,091
动物们的自然迁徙了
for the wildebeest migration,

520
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,081
我们可以自己创造
we create our own.

521
00:46:50,801 --> 00:46:55,001
草原使得我们可以主宰这个星球
Grasslands have allowed us to dominate the planet.

522
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,541
它们是人类勾勒出的
They are the landscape

523
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,161
美好的画卷
of phenomenal human achievement.

524
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:05,401
巩固了我们现在整体生存的状态
They underpin our present global existence.

525
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:11,601
这些牛群  生在印度  长在澳大利亚
These cattle, native to India, raised in Australia,

526
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:13,131
很快就会被运往全球各地
will soon be shipped out

527
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:16,151
满足各国对于牛肉的需求
to feed the international appetite for beef.

528
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,561
牧牛季过去后
And over the season...

529
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:21,641
它们会让本成为百万富翁
they'll make Ben a millionaire.

530
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:25,481
-你靠这些赚了不少钱吧  -是的
- Are you making much out of it? - Yeah.

531
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:28,161
大概有130万美金
About 1.3 million bucks.

532
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:30,201
为此整日操劳还是挺值的嘛
That's worth getting out of bed for!

533
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:31,481
没错
Yeah.

534
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:39,991
我们的匠心巧工  团队精神
Our ingenuity and teamwork,

535
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:41,441
还有无畏的勇气
intelligence and courage

536
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,381
都在草原上得到了充分的发扬光大
have all been refined in the grasslands.

537
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:52,161
正是这些人类独有的能力
And this uniquely human combination of skills

538
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,001
让我们征服了世界
has enabled us to conquer the world.

539
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:02,361
如果没有这些草原
Without the grasslands,

540
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:06,641
地球永远就不可能成为人类的地球
planet Earth would never have become the Human Planet.

541
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:11,141
人类星球
镜头背后的故事

542
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:17,131
要从非洲最凶猛的猎食者囊中
Trying to steal food from the

543
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:19,761
苟且地偷得一些食物
jaws of the most powerful predator in Africa

544
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:22,181
听起来像异想天开
may seem to us like lunacy,

545
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:25,321
但这项特别且危险的举动
but this extraordinary and dangerous feat

546
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:29,041
却在肯尼亚有着几千年的历史
has been practised in Kenya for thousands of years.

547
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,541
但是关于它的影像纪录前无古人
But it has never been filmed before,

548
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,111
可能也不再会有来者
and may never be filmed again.

549
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,101
多罗博族是一个
The Dorobo are an ancient tribe

550
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:49,801
生活在东非草原的古老部落
who live in the grasslands of East Africa.

551
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:56,521
欧金耶  肯尼亚

552
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,751
现在的草原保护法禁止了
Conservation laws now stop

553
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,931
他们的很多传统活动
many of their traditional practices

554
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,081
因此大大威胁到他们的生存
and so threaten their whole way of life.

555
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:04,011
为了纪录这个独特的事件
To record this unique sequence,

556
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,841
草原拍摄组需要找到一个人
the Grasslands team needed a man

557
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:10,161
要既懂狮子的习性又了解当地的多罗博人
who understands both lions and the Dorobo people who live here.

558
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,711
摄影组的导游杰克逊・卢赛亚
Jackson Looseyia, the crew's guide,

559
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:17,201
对这种生活方式有着深刻的理解
has a deep understanding of this way of life,

560
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,581
从小生长在附近的马塞马拉地区
having grown up nearby in the Masai Mara.

561
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:24,161
BBC剧组问我
When I was asked by the BBC

562
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,501
他们能否纪录这个故事时
if they are able to document this story,

563
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:30,241
我说  能啊  我就亲自干过那事
I said, yeah, because it's something that I've practised myself.

564
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:33,361
我成长过程中经常追赶狮子来夺取食物
I've chased lions from food when I was growing up.

565
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:34,681
我了解这种生活方式
I knew this lifestyle.

566
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:38,461
杰克逊・卢赛亚
导游

567
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,571
是完全可能的
It's possible,

568
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:39,401
只要BBC剧组手脚够快
it's just a matter of if the BBC are able to capture

569
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:41,761
就能抓拍到好东西
this before it is gone.

570
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:45,551
但肯定不容易
It won't be easy,

571
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:48,321
这里的狮子对车很陌生
as the lions here aren't used to cars,

572
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:50,681
所以很难接近
so they're difficult to approach.

573
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,241
它们一般在夜晚出没猎食
They mainly hunt at night

574
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,041
徒步接近的话太危险
when it's too dangerous to get close on foot.

575
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,641
难就难在如何找到拂晓捕猎的狮子
So the challenge is to find a lion kill at dawn,

576
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:02,981
从而让多罗博人
to enable the Dorobo

577
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:06,831
和摄影师华伦・塞缪尔能完成拍摄
and big cat cameraman Warren Samuels to do their jobs.

578
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:10,061
我们得坐等狮子来猎食
We've got to wait for the lion to make the kill

579
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:11,351
那个时机必须刚好
and it's got to be at a time

580
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:16,231
华伦・塞缪尔
摄影师

581
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,561
既要能保证安全
when we can still come out early morning

582
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:16,411
又要有足够的自然光把片子拍好
and still have enough light to film them on the kill.

583
00:50:17,191 --> 00:50:19,221
我们很期待能有好运气
We're hoping for a lot of luck.

584
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:24,281
第一缕光出现时  杰克逊加入了多罗博人
At first light, Jackson joins the Dorobo,

585
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:27,131
希望追踪一次鲜活的捕猎活动
in the hope of tracking down a fresh lion kill.

586
00:50:27,131 --> 00:50:29,091
你看  这就是狮子的脚印
You can see this is a footprint of a lion,

587
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:30,461
看得出这狮子很大
a very big lion,

588
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:34,361
还有  这个脚印是羚羊的
and you can see there's a footprint of a wildebeest.

589
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:37,681
瞧啊  这是一个非常大的狮群
Look here, you see, this is a very, very big pride,

590
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:39,611
看看足印的数量
looking at the number of footprints,

591
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:44,161
还有常常喜欢来喝水的地方
and the number of places that they like to drink.

592
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,581
狮子喜欢在破晓之时捕猎
Because lions often hunt just before dawn,

593
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:51,081
所以摄影组只好不分昼夜地守着
the team have to follow them both day and night.

594
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:57,841
在非洲  夜晚有着数不尽的故事
In Africa, night is everything.

595
00:50:57,841 --> 00:51:01,601
恐怖  可怕  但却充满生机
It's terrifying, it's scary. But it's so much alive.

杰克逊・卢赛亚
导游

597
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:10,321
看见它们了吗  那就是狮群
Do you see them? There are the lions,

598
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:12,081
我们找到了  仔细听
we've found them, listen.

599
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:14,351
和杰克逊一起值夜班的
Sharing the night shift with Jackson

600
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,741
是《人类星球》的学者  简・阿金斯
is Human Planet researcher, Jane Atkins.

601
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,681
我们遇到的是母狮和它们的八只小崽
We just came across lionesses with their eight cubs

602
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:23,251
对多罗博人居住的地区很熟络的样子
quite local to where the Dorobo guys live.

603
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,061
但是弊端在于
But the down side of that

604
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:28,081
简・阿金斯
《人类星球》的学者

605
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:27,891
当多罗博人目睹一次猎食行为时
is that when the Dorobo do come across a kill,

606
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:29,881
特别是狮群又在主场作战
if it's in this area with this pride,

607
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,301
这些母狮子们
these lionesses are going to be

608
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,801
会被激发起更强的攻击性和保护欲
a lot more aggressive and protective.

609
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:42,201
在夜晚努力想跟上这个狮群很是困难
The struggle to try and keep up with this pride at night

610
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:43,421
他们聚集在那边
is because they cross in places

611
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:45,181
机动车没法过去
that a vehicle would not be able to cross.

612
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:46,901
一旦跟丢了
Once you lose them, you know,

613
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:49,201
你就可能会错过它们的猎食行为
they do stuff behind your back.

614
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:52,321
所以得时刻紧紧跟着
So you are having to be on the go the whole time.

615
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:57,271
跟踪了狮群整整一晚
After following the lions all night,

616
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:59,381
他们还是未能看到狮子的猎食
they still haven't seen a kill.

617
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:02,481
值白班的华伦
Warren, on the day shift,

618
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:05,511
发现了其中的原因
discovers there's a very good reason why.

619
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,671
最理想的情况是
Ideally, the situation

620
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:09,001
有一大群羚羊供捕杀
we wanted here was big herds of wildebeest,

621
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,741
然后狮子大量地捕杀它们
we wanted to get lions making kills,

622
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,271
但是今年雨季来的有点早
but the rains have come a little early,

623
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:15,611
大部分的动物都迁徙到平原了
so most of the animals are up on the plains.

624
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:18,251
所以现在能见到的都是五六只的小群羚羊
All we've got now are small groups of five or six wildebeest.

625
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:19,311
我们非常希望
So we're really hoping

626
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:21,711
有一个狮群能幸运地遇到
that one of those groups of lions gets lucky

627
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:23,481
并且杀死其中一头羚羊
and that they manage to kill one of them.

628
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:25,201
没有别的羚羊群了
No more groups of wildebeest.

629
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:27,331
唯一一群就在你眼前
Just that one group you can see.

630
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:29,181
又过了四天
Four more days pass

631
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,391
还是没有目睹狮子猎杀羚羊
and no lion kills have been seen.

632
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:35,941
终于  他们走了一点点小运
Finally, they get a shred of luck.

633
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:38,911
目前有一大群羚羊
We've got a big herd of wildebeest

634
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:42,001
从地平线那头迁徙回来
going through the horizon heading to the crossings again.

635
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:45,201
我们有机会等到一次狮子的捕杀
We may have a chance again of a kill.

636
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:52,401
摄制组立刻跟上多罗博人的脚步
The crew head off on the heels of the Dorobo.

637
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:55,611
几小时的追随过后
But after hours of tracking,

638
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,201
还是未有狮子捕杀的迹象
again there's no sign of a kill.

639
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:04,291
又轮到简和夜巡组了
Jane and the night shift take over.

640
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,401
我们发现了正在觅食的一头母狮
We've just come across the lionesses

641
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:13,821
一头公狮  还有小崽们
and the male and all their cubs on a kill,

642
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:16,701
我们只有
and we are about...

643
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:20,341
大概五米远
five metres away.

644
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:23,881
那头公狮正在捕杀羚羊
The adult male is sitting now on a wildebeest kill.

645
00:53:26,451 --> 00:53:28,221
我们现在还不能拍
We are not going to be able to film this

646
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:31,161
因为  等天亮的时候
because, by the time it gets light,

647
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,011
它们早就完成了
they'll have finished it.

648
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:38,961
但能如此近距离地观察真是让人惊奇
But it's absolutely amazing to be able to see it so close.

649
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:45,911
摄制组的车被23头饥饿的狮子包围
The vehicle is now surrounded by 23 hungry lions.

650
00:53:53,391 --> 00:53:55,361
那是什么  就在车门外

651
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,401
天啊
Oh, God!

652
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,041
天哪
My God!

653
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,801
刚刚有一头狮子
We've just had a lion

654
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,891
在嚼我们的备用胎
chewing at our back tyre,

655
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:15,011
我着实吓了一跳
and I absolutely kacked myself!

656
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,141
打死我也不敢走上前去

657
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:28,151
或者偷走它们的食物

658
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:29,321
瞅瞅那模样
Look at them!

659
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,381
多罗博人可不这么想
Not the Dorobo.

660
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:32,721
他们一直都这样
They say they do it all the time.

661
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:35,161
我不知道他们怎么办到的
I don't know how they do it, I mean...

662
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:38,291
真的很可怕
...it's terrifying.

663
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:49,191
破晓时  狮群早已完成了猎杀
By dawn, the lions have finished the kill.

664
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:55,621
换班的时候  狮子的咬功才被发现
At the shift change, the power of the lion's bite is revealed.

665
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,061
看啊  真是不可思议
Look at that, it's amazing!

666
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:01,961
真是个亢奋的夜晚
Quite an adrenaline-filled night, really.

667
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:07,131
现在是早上八点  我刚值完夜班
It's eight in the morning, I've just finished my night shift,

668
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:09,491
尽管发现了在捕猎的狮群
and although we found lions on a kill,

669
00:55:09,491 --> 00:55:10,771
等到华伦出来
by the time Warren came out

670
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:13,071
光线适合拍摄的时候
and it was light enough for him to film,

671
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:16,351
但羚羊的残骸已消失殆尽
the carcass was pretty much ripped apart.

672
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:20,191
我们只剩几天了
You know, we've only got a few more days left.

673
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:26,561
最后他们终于等到了好消息
At last they get the news everyone's been waiting for.

674
00:55:26,561 --> 00:55:29,651
他们一直跟踪的那个狮群正在猎杀
The pride they've been following has made a fresh kill.

675
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:33,411
光线足够进行拍摄  多罗博人也蓄势待发
It's light enough to film, and the Dorobo are ready.

676
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:46,671
我们在物色一个绝佳之处
We are just trying to find a position

677
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:47,721
能够有一个清晰的视野
where we can get a clear view.

678
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:49,811
路上灌木丛太多了
There's too much brush in the way.

679
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:55,321
拍摄组还很担心多罗博人的安全
The crew are still worried about the Dorobos' safety.

680
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:59,221
它们可能会咬死我们

681
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:03,121
当你做这事时  你都想着他人而不是自己

682
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:07,471
你都想着他人而不是自己

683
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:10,821
摄制组这么担心我们

684
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:14,661
看起来是在劝我们放弃

685
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,231
好像我们是菜鸟一样

686
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:56,081
真不敢相信我们能拍到这个镜头
I didn't believe that we would get this shot.

687
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:58,761
我还以为狮子们会攻击他们
I thought the lions would attack these guys

688
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:01,001
尤其是当他们还要靠近小崽时
especially when they had their cubs.

689
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:04,401
突然  那只大公狮站起来开始跑
But all of a sudden, when the big male got up and ran,

690
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:07,301
我以为它是来攻击我们的
I was relieved, because I thought he would be

691
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,571
但它没有  一颗心就放下了
the one which will attack us,

692
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:14,661
但我真的很开心  好激动  哎呀呀
but I'm really, really chuffed. Great stuff! Ay-ay-ah!

693
00:57:17,961 --> 00:57:19,921
我和多罗博人在生活方式上
The special connection I've got with the Dorobo

694
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:21,731
建立了一种特别的联系
is the lifestyle.

695
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:26,591
想到这种联系就要失去了让人很感伤
It's pretty sad to know that it's about to disappear.

696
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:30,371
和他们在一起的这段时间
The time that I've spent with these guys,

697
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,481
实在是过得太快了
I think it's too short.

698
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:35,721
我意识到我失去了什么
I've realised how much I have lost

699
00:57:35,721 --> 00:57:38,291
也知道从和他们相处的两周里
and how much I have learnt so far

700
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,821
学到了什么
since I have been with them in the last two weeks.

701
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:44,461
我会很开心的
I would be very happy

702
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,081
要是这部片子可以留给我孩子们看
if this has been captured for my kids

703
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:50,641
留给多罗博人的子孙们看
and the rest of the generations of the Dorobo kids,

704
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:54,521
并且为我们的祖先  父辈  兄长们的
and be proud that our ancestors, our fathers, our elders

705
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:57,841
这些壮举而感到自豪
did practise this scary, scary experience.
