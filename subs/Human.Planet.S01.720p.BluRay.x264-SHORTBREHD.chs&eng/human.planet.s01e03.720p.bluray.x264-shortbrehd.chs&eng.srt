1
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:09,695
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:13,295
在地球的每一个角落留下了印迹
in every habitat on Earth.

3
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,535
那就是我们人类
That creature is us.

4
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:22,455
四海之内  我们仍运用自己的聪明才智
All over the world, we still use our ingenuity to survive

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,145
在荒野之地生存
in the wild places,

6
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,475
远离城市灯火
far from the city lights,

7
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:29,775
与原始自然面对面
face to face with raw nature.

8
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:50,785
在我们星球的最顶部
At the top of our planet lies

9
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,065
是地球上最渺无人烟的地方之一
one of the most remote places on Earth.

10
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:55,755
北极
The Arctic.

11
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:06,055
在冬季  这片区域连续数月
In winter, the region is frozen

12
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:07,815
被冰雪覆盖并笼罩在黑暗中
and dark for months on end.

13
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:19,575
那里没有树木  没有可以果腹的植物
There are no trees and there are no plants to eat.

14
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:26,145
上帝创造人类时
We humans weren't built to withstand

15
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:29,855
并没有想到我们要抵御如此恶劣的环境
a landscape as hostile as this.

16
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,465
但是  仍有四百万人居住在这里
And yet, four million people live here.

17
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,775
他们对这里了如指掌  依靠这点
Their survival relies upon an intimate knowledge of this,

18
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,665
才得以在地球最恶劣的环境中生存
the most hostile habitat on Earth.

19
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:13,305
北极

20
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:13,305
千里冰封下的生活

21
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,405
北极迎来了新的一年
The beginning of a new Arctic year.

22
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,105
经过数月黑暗的冬季
After months of winter darkness,

23
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,425
太阳终于重新照在这片白雪皑皑的土地上
the sun finally returns to this frozen land.

24
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,575
对于格陵兰岛撒图特的因纽特人来说
For the Inuit of Saattut, Greenland,

25
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,055
太阳再次普照大地
the sun's return

26
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:44,305
标志着狩猎季的开始
marks the beginning of their hunting calendar.

27
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,555
既然这些居民拥有充足的白昼
Now that the residents have enough daylight,

28
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,805
不可胜数的捕食机会在向他们招手
a world of opportunity opens up.

29
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:06,975
他们可以去远离城镇的地方探险
They can embark on expeditions far from town,

30
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:15,915
穿越数千公里的冰封海面
travelling across the thousands of kilometres of sea ice

31
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,895
到达他们的捕猎区
that lead to their hunting grounds.

32
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,575
多谢
这会很有用的

33
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,055
今天  阿莫斯・扬森
Today, Amos Jensen

34
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,335
和他的儿子卡尔弗雷德里克
and his son Karl-Frederik

35
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,945
要给他们的狗喂食
have to feed their dogs.

36
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,665
这些狗极其重要
Their dogs are essential.

37
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,665
每年这个时候  狗拉雪橇
At this time of year, the dogsled

38
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,955
是他们唯一的代步工具
is their only means of transportation.

39
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:55,165
这些狗对我非常重要...

40
00:03:55,165 --> 00:04:00,095
猎手的生存
依赖于这些健壮的雪橇狗

41
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:04,855
因为他们的捕猎旅程会花费一些时间
Because their hunting trip could take some time,

42
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:07,685
这对父子需要一些家的温暖
father and son will need a few comforts of home,

43
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:11,815
或者直接把家带走
or even home itself.

44
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,415
为了找到营养丰富的狗粮
To find the most nutritious dog food,

45
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,085
阿莫斯和卡尔弗雷德里克
Amos and Karl-Frederik

46
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:30,185
需要在冰封的海面上穿行十几公里
need to travel many kilometres across the sea ice.

47
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:39,685
他们的目标是一只真正的北极海怪
What they're after is a real-life Arctic sea monster,

48
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,165
格陵兰鲨鱼
a Greenland shark.

49
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,275
要支撑他们的重量
To support their weight,

50
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:04,295
冰层的厚度只需有五厘米
the ice only needs to be five centimetres thick,

51
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:05,775
大约两英寸
about two inches.

52
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,395
这里的冰层近一米厚
This ice is nearly a metre thick,

53
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,825
足以支撑起一架巨型喷气飞机
and it could support a jumbo jet.

54
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,455
阿莫斯知道
Amos knows that

55
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,675
格陵兰鲨鱼喜欢吃鲸鱼肉
Greenland sharks are partial to whale meat.

56
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,175
他也清楚鲨鱼生活在海底深处
And he also knows they live in the deepest waters.

57
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:45,635
现在
Now,

58
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:46,805
人和狗
both men and dogs

59
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,375
都只能等着鲨鱼上钩
have to wait for something to take the bait.

60
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,565
这些可怜的狗需要食物

61
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:02,465
我真希望明天能捕到什么

62
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,575
当气温骤降至摄氏零下35度
As temperatures plummet to -35 degrees Celsius,

63
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,125
对狗来说  厚厚的皮毛可帮它们保暖
the dogs' thick fur keeps them warm.

64
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,415
但如果没有小木屋
But without their hut,

65
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:31,435
阿莫斯和卡尔弗雷德里克会被冻死
Amos and Karl-Frederik would freeze to death.

66
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,495
来看看今天这些狗能不能吃上东西
It's time to check if the dogs will eat today.

67
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,705
我们捕到食物了

68
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,455
从鱼线上传来的震动来看
From the vibrations he feels on the fishing line,

69
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:02,475
他知道他们钓到东西了
he knows they've hooked something.

70
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,435
是个很大的家伙

71
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,595
把线拉上来后他们才能知道是否是条鲨鱼
But he won't know if it's a shark until they pull it up.

72
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,395
猎物在海底非常深的地方
It's down so deep

73
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,895
他们需要把鱼线
they have to stretch their fishing line

74
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:23,635
沿着冰面拉上几百米
along the ice in hundred-metre lengths.

75
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,615
他们把猎物向上拉了800米
They pull their catch up a staggering 800 metres,

76
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:37,875
这一惊人的数字近帝国大厦高度的两倍
nearly twice the height of the Empire State Building.

77
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,325
老天  太重了

78
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,305
让我看看...

79
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:01,385
居然这么大

80
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:18,255
如愿以偿  他们捕到了格陵兰鲨鱼
They've caught the Greenland shark they were hoping for.

81
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,045
我从没见过...

82
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,685
体型如此庞大的鲨鱼

83
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,005
看看这些鳍

84
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,725
这条鲨鱼真够大的

85
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:36,475
格陵兰鲨鱼
The Greenland shark is

86
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,695
是北冰洋里唯一一种土生土长的鲨鱼
the only native Arctic shark.

87
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:43,495
是海洋中体型最庞大的食肉动物之一
It's one of the largest predators in these seas.

88
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,955
研究人员在它的腹中
Researchers have found caribou

89
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,715
发现过驯鹿  甚至还有北极熊的残骸
and even polar bears in its stomach.

90
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:58,285
连鳍都没办法从洞里拿出来

91
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,575
这条鲨鱼恰巧
The shark has accidentally

92
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,615
被鱼线缠住了尾巴
wrapped the fishing line round its tail.

93
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:10,255
这种被捕的情况并不常见
It's not the normal way to land a shark,

94
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:11,865
但既然有收获就不用计较这些
but a catch is a catch.

95
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,385
它在洞口卡住了

96
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:18,215
我们需要把洞凿宽点

97
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,625
当心
那些牙齿很锋利

98
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,455
阿莫斯和卡尔仅靠自己无法把鲨鱼拉上岸
Amos and Karl can't lift the shark by themselves

99
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,875
所以得借助那些狗的帮忙
so they enlist the help of the dogs.

100
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:11,275
这条鲨鱼长四米  超过半吨重
This shark is four metres long, weighs over half a ton

101
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,675
是他们抓到过的最大的一条
and is the largest they've ever caught.

102
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,955
但仅够给那些狗提供两周的食物
But it will only feed their 20 dogs for two weeks.

103
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:33,525
对于格陵兰岛居民
For Greenlanders,

104
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,535
如果他们要继续狩猎捕鱼
it is essential to have well-fed dogs

105
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,065
拥有健壮的狗至关重要
if they're to continue hunting and fishing.

106
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:50,375
我不敢想象
没有这些狗的生活

107
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,585
他们对我非常重要

108
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:01,375
他们是我留给孩子们的遗产

109
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,385
在北极
Here in the Arctic,

110
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:07,405
人与狗之间的情感纽带举足轻重
the bond between man and dog is so important.

111
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,645
如果没有这些人类最好的朋友
It's unlikely we would have colonised

112
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:12,375
我们绝不可能征服这片土地
this habitat without our best friends.

113
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,975
日子一天天过去
As the year moves on,

114
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,775
人们对生存的探索仍毫不停歇
so does the quest for survival.

115
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,065
纵然现在是三月
Even thought it's March,

116
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:28,305
北冰洋仍沉睡在海冰之下
the Arctic Ocean is still dominated by sea ice.

117
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,805
四倍于美国国土面积的土地
An area four times the size of the United States

118
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:35,335
仍覆盖在冰雪之中
is frozen over.

119
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:41,475
这片冰层将欧洲与俄罗斯
The ice connects Europe to Russia,

120
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,515
俄罗斯和北美洲连接起来
and Russia to North America.

121
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:50,255
在加拿大的北极区域
And here in the Canadian Arctic,

122
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,145
对于冰层之下的事物
people have a unique insight into

123
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,925
人们有着独一无二的洞察力
what lies beneath the ice.

124
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,325
在加拿大东北部的康奇朱斯瓦克
In Kangiqsujjuaq, northeast Canada,

125
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:02,335
卢卡西・纳帕鲁克正在观察潮汐
Lukasi Nappaaluk is watching the tides.

126
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:06,415
明天  春分的时候
Tomorrow, the spring equinox

127
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:09,775
将发生一年中规模最大的潮汐
will create the most extreme tides of the year,

128
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:12,725
带来一次绝佳的捕食机会
and a spectacular opportunity for a meal.

129
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:17,055
因纽特人居住的土地上寸草不生

130
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:19,935
我们无法耕种

131
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:27,185
但我们因纽特人有自己的生存方法

132
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,855
这次小潮为冰层下的
The neap tide literally opens a door

133
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,805
海鲜园开启了一扇门
for a garden of seafood just below the ice.

134
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,825
你只需找到它的位置
You just need to know where to find it.

135
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:50,035
卢卡西和朋友们用雪地车代替狗拉雪橇
Lukasi and his friends prefer snowmobiles to dogsleds.

136
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,205
他们也无需把遮风挡雨的屋子带在身边
And they don't bother to bring along a shelter either.

137
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,925
为了保护自己  躲避暴风雪
Everything they need

138
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,695
他们所需要的所有材料
to protect themselves from the elements

139
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,325
就在自己脚下
is right beneath their feet.

140
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:14,625
老人们告诉我们
"一定要会建雪屋"

141
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,205
因为如果你离家捕猎...

142
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:23,805
但不会建雪屋
你会被冻死

143
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:32,175
即使屋外是摄氏零下45度
Even if it's -45 degrees Celsius outside,

144
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:36,925
雪屋内也能达到温暖舒适的零上16度
body warmth can heat an igloo to a balmy +16,

145
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:40,415
足足有60度的温差
a full 60 degrees warmer.

146
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:45,825
年轻的一代
已经忘记怎么建雪屋

147
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:49,465
...但我希望这种技能

148
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:53,205
...能重新流传下去

149
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,445
坐在温暖的雪屋内
Cosy inside their igloo,

150
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:00,105
卢卡西和朋友们必须静静等待
Lukasi and his friends must now wait.

151
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,225
在捕食之前
Before they can hunt,

152
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,355
会出现一些奇特的现象
something extraordinary has to happen.

153
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:17,575
在海冰之下
Underneath the sea ice,

154
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,015
潮水逐渐退去
the tide is going out

155
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:22,765
一点一点地
and out.

156
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:30,795
这片浮冰居然下沉了12米
The floating ice drops a staggering 12 metres,

157
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,385
约40英尺
nearly 40 feet,

158
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:34,955
露出了海床  也希望
exposing the seabed, and, hopefully,

159
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:37,795
会带来他们迫切需要的食物
the bounty they're after.

160
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:44,005
卢卡西和朋友们试着
Lukasi and his friends try to get

161
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,945
尽快下到冰层之下
under the ice as quickly as possible.

162
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,385
在潮水回流之前
They have just half an hour

163
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:51,905
他们只有半小时
before the tide comes back in.

164
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,685
我们做的最胆战心惊的事...

165
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,495
就是走下冰层

166
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,395
他们脚下的世界毫不牢固
The world beneath their feet is unstable.

167
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,895
巨大的冰块缺乏海水的支撑
The giant blocks of ice are no longer supported by water

168
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,895
可能会随时崩塌
and could collapse at any moment.

169
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,885
地球上只有这个地方
This is the only place on Earth

170
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:36,025
潮水涨退的落差极大
where the tides are extreme enough

171
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,875
让人们有胆量在海冰层下探险
to allow people to dare venture under the sea ice.

172
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:46,645
在这个不久前还充斥着海水的冰窖里
And in a chamber that moments ago was underwater,

173
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,515
他们找到了所需要的东西
they find what they're looking for.

174
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:52,445
贻贝
Mussels.

175
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,665
他们所期盼的也仅此而已
All they could hope for.

176
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:03,475
现在他们争分夺秒  尽可能多地捡贻贝
Now they have just minutes to gather all they can carry.

177
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:10,545
潮水涨起时  无人能阻止
The returning tide is an unstoppable force.

178
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:16,245
我们都了解贻贝捕食者的故事

179
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,715
...关于那些无法及时返回地面的捕食者

180
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:22,715
如果你没法脱身
你就会死

181
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,655
当海水逐渐回流
As the sea steadily flows back,

182
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:36,295
会托起千斤重的冰块
it lifts the huge blocks of ice over their heads.

183
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:41,345
大水来了  快走吧

184
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:46,135
就在他们撤退时  冰块就在他们身边浮起
Even as they escape, the ice shifts around them.

185
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:55,775
大海要收回它的神秘花园了
The ocean reclaims its secret garden.

186
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,055
卢卡西只能在大潮期这几天里
Lukasi can only harvest mussels

187
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:10,685
去捡拾贻贝
for the few days of extreme tides.

188
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,885
这些贻贝真不错

189
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:23,955
贻贝是我们冬日食物的重要来源

190
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,215
在终日以鱼和肉为食的冬天
Mussels are a delicious way to break up a diet

191
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:31,095
用贻贝来换换口味让人觉得美滋滋的
that during winter has been mainly seal meat and fish.

192
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:36,255
但夏日将至
But summer is on the way,

193
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,255
万物将变
and everything is about to change.

194
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:50,875
到六月  阳光使气温回升至零度以上
By June, the sun finally pushes temperatures above zero.

195
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,795
冰海将融
The sea ice begins to melt.

196
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,665
待到浮冰融化之时
And as it breaks apart,

197
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:02,605
一年一度的夏季迁徙就开始了
it triggers an annual summer migration.

198
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,535
远离海岸整整一个冬季的动物们
Animals that have spent the winter far offshore

199
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,905
开始追随着融冰向海湾进发
follow the melting ice into the bays and fjords.

200
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:23,485
这是北极猎人们千载难逢的机会
For Arctic hunters, this creates a unique opportunity.

201
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,095
马穆拉・克里斯蒂安森
Mamarut Kristiansen,

202
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,335
以及他的兄弟米克莱和葛迪恩
and his brothers Mikele and Gedion,

203
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,785
是北格陵兰岛的因纽特人
are Thule Inuit from northern Greenland.

204
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:47,575
他们急着奔赴狩猎行程中
They're rushing to keep the most important appointment

205
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,875
最重要的约会
in their hunting calendar.

206
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:52,405
他们必须得准时
They must be punctual.

207
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:54,795
几周后  他们所踩覆的冰块
In just a few weeks, the sea ice

208
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:56,665
就会消失殆尽
they're travelling on will melt away.

209
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,775
他们的目标是北极最珍稀的食物
Their goal is the most precious food in the Arctic.

210
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,105
独角鲸
Narwhal.

211
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:20,395
这些传奇般的鲸也向海湾行进
These legendary whales are looking for a way into the bay.

212
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:25,025
这是一种神秘的生物
This is a mythic creature...

213
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,055
但却富含着北极最稀有的维生素
...but it is also a source of the rarest vitamin in the Arctic.

214
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:38,995
维生素C
Vitamin C.

215
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:51,505
在这片果蔬贫瘠的土地上
In a landscape with so few edible fruits or plants,

216
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,875
因纽特人别无选择
the Inuit don't have alternatives.

217
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,765
他们在那儿

218
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:13,695
它们不想靠近冰缘...

219
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:15,575
独角鲸难能一见
Spotting narwhal is hard enough.

220
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:18,495
即便科学家也很少见到它们
Even scientists who study them rarely see them.

221
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:22,215
但若米克莱想抓住一条
But if Mikele is going to catch one,

222
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:25,365
这些独角鲸得再游近些了
the narwhal will have to swim a great deal closer than this.

223
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:31,405
我看不见它们了...

224
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,095
它们会回来的

225
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:44,405
好几周后  三兄弟才再次看见了独角鲸
It could be weeks before the three brothers see narwhal again.

226
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:50,765
他们仍得保持警惕  还有很多准备要做
But they have to stay alert, and there's plenty to prepare.

227
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:55,115
这里的法律规定
In this region, the law states

228
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,985
猎人们只能采取传统方法
that hunters can only use traditional methods.

229
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,615
也就是得划着独木舟
This means travelling in kayaks,

230
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:05,535
一种因纽特人千年沿袭下来的船
a craft the Inuit invented thousands of years ago,

231
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:07,755
还要用Avatak[一种捕鱼工具]
and using the avatak,

232
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,605
一种用环斑海豹皮做成的浮标
a buoy made from the skin of a ring seal.

233
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:20,965
给我讲个睡前故事吧

234
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:25,205
别再睡过头了

235
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:28,235
也别老打呼噜

236
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,335
即便午夜时分  阳光依旧灿烂
Even though it's midnight, the sun still shines.

237
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:37,955
六月的太阳在天空盘旋
In June, the sun simply circles the sky,

238
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,975
从不落下
never dipping below the horizon.

239
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,075
我要睡觉了...

240
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:47,885
你会一直看着的吧

241
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,465
真舒服...

242
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:57,735
要保持始终有一人守卫  这很关键
It's vital that one of them stands guard at all times.

243
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:01,605
但葛迪恩不只要找寻独角鲸
But Gedion isn't just looking for narwhal.

244
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,695
他还要观察冰面
He's watching the ice.

245
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:16,555
冰层已经薄到快裂开来了
Already it's thinning and breaking apart.

246
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:21,885
一不小心
If they're not careful,

247
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,435
三兄弟很可能会发现
the brothers could find themselves

248
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:26,125
自己置身于漂浮的融冰之上
adrift on a melting piece of ice.

249
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:35,645
这些年来
这些冰块一直是我们心头之患...

250
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:42,735
他们融的太快了
我们想要靠近独角鲸...

251
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:45,605
变得更难了

252
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:55,655
但一旦真来了的话...

253
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,995
你得做好准备

254
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,115
马穆拉和葛迪恩知道绝不能慌张
Mamarut and Gedion know not to panic.

255
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:45,165
独角鲸相当的谨小慎微
Narwhal are extremely skittish,

256
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:49,455
所以他们小心翼翼地涉入水中
so the hunters enter the water with care.

257
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:54,105
哪怕一丁点错误

258
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:58,865
哪怕是划桨时动作大了一点
他们都会立刻察觉到

259
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,575
兄弟齐心
The three brothers work as a team.

260
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,855
他们仅以某只独角鲸为目标
They're after just one whale.

261
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,585
他们采用埋伏战略
It's an ambush.

262
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:27,165
独角鲸离米克莱只有50英尺远[15米]
The narwhal pass within 50 feet of Mikele

263
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:32,535
但他们仍按兵不动
but still all three hunters wait.

264
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,345
太早行动
If he strikes too soon,

265
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:39,975
只会满盘皆输
the whole pod will dive.

266
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,625
他瞄准了殿后的那条鲸
His eye is on the stragglers bringing up the rear.

267
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,725
尤其在这最后关头
Especially in the final approach,

268
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:17,605
米克莱必须静静地跟随着猎物
Mikele must be silent and directly behind his prey.

269
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:30,885
全家的温饱都肩负在他们身上
Their success will benefit the whole community.

270
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:35,825
一条独角鲸即使不能满足一家成月的需求
The single narwhal will feed their families for weeks,

271
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,485
也能管饱几个星期
if not months.

272
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:45,075
我们的祖先物尽其用

273
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:45,075
所有动物都有价值

274
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:48,575
而我们也继承了他们的衣钵

275
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,245
独角鲸最值钱的部位是它的皮
The most prized part of the narwhal is the skin.

276
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,515
他们称之为鲸脂
They call it muktuk.

277
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:56,885
这是他们最主要的维生素C来源
It's their primary source of vitamin C.

278
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:00,445
独角鲸中  维生素C的含量
Ounce for ounce, narwhal skin contains

279
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,975
几乎和橘子一样多
almost as much vitamin C as oranges.

280
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,075
味道不错

281
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:12,785
没有这些独角鲸  很难想象
Without narwhal,it's doubtful

282
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:16,415
因纽特人怎样在北极大陆上存活下来
the Inuit would have survived in this part of the Arctic.

283
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:25,675
时值六月  太阳赢得了胜利
It's now July, and the sun finally wins its battle.

284
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:30,905
冰面融化成广阔的海洋
The sea ice melts into open ocean.

285
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:39,275
要想找到食物  人们将目标转向大陆
To find food, man turns his attention to the land.

286
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:48,535
位于格陵兰岛的西奥拉帕卢克
Siorapaluk, Greenland,

287
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,485
是地球上最北的原始居留地
is the northernmost native settlement on Earth.

288
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:54,515
每年
Every year,

289
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:57,705
马恒咖・欧师马都有幸一睹
Maassannguaq Oshima is treated to a spectacle.

290
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:02,475
成千上万的海雀迁徙之景
Millions of little auks on migration.

291
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,105
它们来这里的悬崖繁衍后代
They come here to breed on the cliffs.

292
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,215
对捕食者来说
And for predators,

293
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:15,985
这里满天飞舞的食物让它们垂涎三尺
there's a mouth-watering supply of protein whizzing overhead.

294
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:20,405
问题是得够得着
If you can reach it.

295
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:08,395
千年前  马恒咖的祖先
Thousands of years ago, Maassannguaq's ancestors

296
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:11,845
用浮木与动物蹄筋制作出了捕鸟网
worked out how to make nets out of sinew and driftwood.

297
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:17,535
并发现了这处他正藏身与其中的捕猎之所
And they created the same hiding spots he uses today.

298
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:22,595
我们等这些海雀
等了一年了

299
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,585
他们是夏日的美味

300
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,995
天气好的话  马恒咖能捕到将近500只
On a good day, Maassannguaq can gather up to 500 birds.

301
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,025
但他却不急着吃
But he won't eat them now.

302
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:46,705
他要向他的动物伙伴学习
He'll take his cue from a fellow hunter.

303
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,855
北极狐经常把一些鸟埋起来
Arctic foxes often stuff a few birds underground,

304
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:53,335
这样没东西吃的时候
so that when times are lean,

305
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,175
他们就有备粮了
they'll have food to fall back on.

306
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:02,135
为了熬过寒冬  充分准备是很必要的

307
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:08,935
要想活下来  你需要储备好食物

308
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:13,025
这些鸟会被用来做成Kiviak[一种发酵食物]
The birds can be used to make kiviak,

309
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:16,095
一种为雨天而储备的食物
a dish that you save for a rainy day.

310
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:20,825
其烹饪方法有数千年的历史
The recipe is thousands of years old,

311
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,425
具体是这样做的
and it goes like this.

312
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:26,415
取一张海豹皮
Take one seal skin.

313
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:33,055
往里面塞尽可能多的海雀
Stuff as many little auks inside it as you can.

314
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:38,335
至少500只
At least 500.

315
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,335
把它缝起来
Sew it up.

316
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:45,215
确保排出所有空气
Make sure you press all the air out.

317
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:52,405
海豹的脂肪可以驱蝇
Seal fat repels flies,

318
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,025
所以缝合口尽量多涂抹点
so be generous when coating the seams.

319
00:30:55,695 --> 00:31:00,775
最后盖上大石头  确保没有空气进入
And finally, use a big rock to make sure no more air gets in.

320
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:11,655
马恒咖的这份Kiviak得等上三个月
Maassannguaq's kiviak won't be ready for three months,

321
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:14,895
不过冰冻的大地是天然的冰箱
but the frozen ground is a natural refrigerator.

322
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:18,555
冬天来时
Come winter,

323
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:21,565
他和他的家人就有充足的食物了
he and his family will have a vital supply of food.

324
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,375
现在到了九月份
It's now September.

325
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:38,845
日照变短  气温骤降
Days are getting shorter and temperatures are plummeting.

326
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,635
那些在北极短暂的夏日里
The few plants that have managed to grow

327
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:45,465
长出来少数植物  变得蔫蔫一息
over the short Arctic summer are dying back.

328
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:52,435
这是挪威北部亚挪岛上
This is exactly what is happening on Arnoy island,

329
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,835
人们生活的真实写照
northern Norway.

330
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,895
三千只驯鹿在此吃了一个夏天的草
3,000 reindeer have been grazing here all summer.

331
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:08,735
但如今  它们得走了
But now they have to move,

332
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:11,425
因为它们冬天的食物来源  地衣
because their winter food source,lichen,

333
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:15,215
要到450千米远外才能找到
can only be found 450 kilometres away.

334
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,825
为了觅食  它们必须横渡
And to get to it, they'll have to cross this,

335
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:21,755
亚挪海峡
the Arnoy strait.

336
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,655
艾莉埃莱尼・斯里的职责
Elle-Helene Siri is in charge

337
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,085
就是带领这些驯鹿过河
of leading these reindeer across the water.

338
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,725
先带这么多吧...

339
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:37,745
她来自一个放养驯鹿的萨米人家庭
She belongs to a family of Sami reindeer herders.

340
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:48,425
迁徙之前
Before the migration begins,

341
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,305
艾莉把鹿分成小组
Elle helps split the deer into smaller groups

342
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,505
这样他们才能给驯鹿喂药
so they can give them vital medicine.

343
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,795
这项工作很危险

344
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:05,115
驯鹿是一种有着锋利茸角的野生动物

345
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:11,245
从艾莉出生那天起
On the day she was born,

346
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:13,555
她就负责照顾这一群驯鹿
Elle was given a portion of this herd.

347
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:21,895
如今20岁的她毕业于挪威驯鹿学院
Now aged 20, and a recent graduate of Norway's reindeer college,

348
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:24,675
她要确保这些驯鹿
it's up to her to make sure they all survive

349
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,895
在接下来的征途中存活下来
the perilous journey ahead.

350
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:33,265
让这些鹿乖乖地迁到冬季牧场
It will take nearly a month for these deer

351
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:35,695
要花近一个月的时间
to migrate to their winter pastures.

352
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:42,015
但今天是最困难的一天
But today is the toughest day of all,

353
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:45,905
因为鹿群要游到2.5千米外的对岸
because the deer have to swim 2.5 kilometres across the channel.

354
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:03,555
刺骨的北冰洋此时的水温刚过冰点
These chilly Arctic waters are only just above freezing.

355
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:09,535
即使对于成年驯鹿  这也是一次漫长的旅行
Even for adult reindeer this is a long swim.

356
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:17,085
对于今年才出生
But for this year's calves,

357
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:19,775
从未下过水的小仔们
which have never been in the water before,

358
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,585
这将是一场马拉松
it's a marathon.

359
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:30,485
在整场大迁徙中...

360
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:35,545
最危险的部分就是横渡海峡

361
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:47,955
很多地方都有可能出问题...

362
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:51,935
尤其是小鹿

363
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:55,465
加油  继续游

364
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:05,075
当年轻的幼崽游到一半时
As the young calves approach the halfway point,

365
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,645
已然疲惫不堪
exhaustion sets in.

366
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,305
对于艾莉而言  此时决不能掉以轻心
For Elle, it's a tense moment,

367
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:20,515
因为一旦有一头小鹿打道回府
because if one calf turns around and swims back,

368
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:21,845
其余的都可能紧随其后
the rest could follow.

369
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,475
在过去  共有150小鹿...

370
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:33,815
...因为害怕而回头

371
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:38,245
你必须时刻盯紧它们

372
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:46,815
一头小母鹿遇到了麻烦
A baby female is in trouble,

373
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:49,175
突然  她掉转了方向
and suddenly, she turns back.

374
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,665
艾莉必须马上阻止她
Elle must stop her

375
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:53,685
否则整场迁徙都可能前功尽弃
or the whole migration could derail.

376
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:14,145
来吧  继续游

377
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:17,145
她做到了
She's done it.

378
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:20,355
大迁徙一切正常
The migration remains on track.

379
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:46,975
经过了一个小时艰难的横渡之行
After an hour of hard swimming,

380
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:50,215
艾莉和她的驯鹿终于到达了对岸
Elle and her reindeer reach the mainland.

381
00:36:50,695 --> 00:36:53,575
真高兴它们成功横渡了海峡

382
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:57,365
我也算卸下了肩头重担

383
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,705
我非常高兴

384
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,975
不久以后  艾莉的驯鹿就能吃到
It won't be long before Elle's deer will be grazing

385
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:11,605
它们在寒冬赖以为生的地衣了
on the lichen they need to get them through the winter.

386
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,875
不仅仅是动物
And it's not just animals

387
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,115
此时为了觅食而出动
looking for a meal at this time of year.

388
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,955
在格陵兰岛  马恒咖和他父亲
In Greenland, Maassannguaq and his father

389
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:29,895
也准备动用他们夏天储存的
are already breaking into the caches of little auks

390
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:31,485
食物海雀了
they stored up in the summer.

391
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:38,695
鸟儿现在已经发酵完毕
The birds have now fermented and have become

392
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:42,335
成了因纽特人的一道美食  Kiviak
the Inuit delicacy known as kiviak.

393
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:45,805
通过气味可以轻松分辨
It's easy to tell

394
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,135
你的Kiviak是否发酵好了
if your kiviak is ready by the aroma.

395
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,895
闻上去应该有些刺鼻
It should sting the nostrils.

396
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:59,265
这就是为什么最好在室外吃Kiviak
This is why it's polite always to serve kiviak outdoors.

397
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,225
它的味道
The flavour should resemble

398
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:10,015
就像重口味的戈贡佐拉奶酪
extremely intense Gorgonzola cheese.

399
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:17,055
一丁点都不能浪费  都是可以吃下去的
Nothing is wasted. Everything is edible.

400
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,605
装了新假牙后...

401
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:22,755
我又可以咬碎骨头了

402
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,055
格陵兰岛北部的
The Inuit of northern Greenland

403
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,215
因纽特人非常喜爱Kiviak
love kiviak so much

404
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:29,765
更是将它奉作生日和婚宴的首选
that it's the dish of choice for birthdays and weddings.

405
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:33,015
而它所富含的营养物质
And it's nutritious,

406
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:34,255
维生素以及矿物质
full of vitamins and minerals

407
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:37,335
可以支撑人们度过严冬
that will sustain people over the winter months ahead.

408
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:47,375
随着九月将尽  十月来临
As September gives way to October,

409
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,825
冬天又重新回到北极地带
winter returns to the Arctic.

410
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,805
海洋再次千里冰封
The ocean ices over once again.

411
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:05,455
最先结冰的地区中  就有哈得逊湾
One of the first places to freeze lies along Hudson's Bay

412
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:08,295
靠近马尼托巴省[加拿大]的丘吉尔港
near the town of Churchill, Manitoba.

413
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,195
每年  这里的一千多个居民
Every year, the 1,000 human residents

414
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:15,135
都不得不与
must share their town

415
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,165
世界上为数不多的经常会猎杀人类的
with one of the few predators on Earth

416
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,205
掠食动物共处一方
that actively hunts human beings.

417
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:31,135
从九月到十一月
From September to November,

418
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,065
将近300多头饥肠辘辘的北极熊
as many as 300 ravenous polar bears

419
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,785
会在回冰原猎食的路上
descend on Churchill

420
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,455
涌入丘吉尔市
on their way back to hunt on the sea ice.

421
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:45,415
鲍勃・温沙负责保护居民安全
Bob Windsor is in charge of protecting the residents.

422
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:48,415
他是"北极熊示警队"
He belongs to a special task force -

423
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,775
特别工作组的成员
the Polar Bear Alert team.

424
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:54,235
北极熊是地道的捕食性动物
Polar bears are pure predators,

425
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:56,295
它们以猎杀其他动物为生
so they kill other animals to eat.

426
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:57,615
这是它们的生存方式
That's how they survive.

427
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:01,295
也就是说  面对北极熊要非常谨慎
Knowing that, you have to give them a little more respect

428
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:03,965
因为你也很可能成为它的盘中之餐
because you could also be a potential meal for them.

429
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:13,175
这里是190[呼叫代码]
This is one nine zero.

430
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:14,445
通知大家
Just to let everybody know

431
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,125
目前正有一头熊向镇上靠近
that there's a bear coming towards town.

432
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,025
作为第一道防线
As a first line of defence,

433
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:26,055
鲍勃试图将这头熊吓回荒野
Bob tries to frighten the bear back into the wilderness.

434
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:37,865
但这样的遭遇战不会就此结束
But this skirmish isn't necessarily over.

435
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,985
由于急需食物充饥
Desperate for something to eat,

436
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:44,275
北极熊经常会在夜色的掩护下重返小城
bears often return in the cover of darkness,

437
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:55,135
对于鲍勃来说尤其糟糕
which is bad news for Bob,

438
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,435
因为今晚  相比平时
because tonight, more than any other night,

439
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,185
更加需要戒惧
fills him with dread.

440
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:01,655
万圣夜对我们来说可能是
Halloween is probably the busiest night

441
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:03,775
一年之中最忙的一个晚上了
of the yearthat we work,

442
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,835
因为这天晚上会有大量居民
just by the sheer number of people

443
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:08,365
会外出活动
out and about that evening.

444
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,455
所以  发生意外的可能性
So, the potential for something bad

445
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:17,895
是显而易见的
to happen is definitely there.

446
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:31,425
当"不给糖就捣乱"的孩子们走街串巷时
At the same time as the trick-or-treaters hit the streets,

447
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,335
人们聚集在皇家协会酒吧
people at the Royal Legion gather for

448
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:35,755
参加每周一次的肉类抽奖活动
their weekly meat raffle.

449
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,615
奖品是上等的加拿大牛肉
The prize for winning is prime Canadian beef.

450
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:43,795
下一位幸运者
Next ticket...

451
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:47,295
440号
number 440.

452
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:02,045
这样单独行动看起来有些不够小心
This may seem cavalier,

453
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:05,465
但是丘吉尔市的居民拒绝活在恐惧之中
but the residents of Churchill refuse to live in fear.

454
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,765
而且有北极熊示警队员的巡逻保护
And the protection of the polar bear patrol

455
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:12,485
他们也非常放心
makes them feel safe.

456
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:16,515
然而  在过去
However, in the past,

457
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,945
北极熊曾在主街上
bears have mauled and killed people

458
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:21,385
袭击并杀死了居民
right here on Main Street,

459
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,275
所以鲍勃再怎么警惕都不为过
and Bob is all too aware of the risks.

460
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:27,785
你总是祈祷
You always hope and pray

461
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,665
不要发生任何意外
that nothing bad is gonna happen.

462
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,995
保持警惕
Keep your eyes open,

463
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:37,755
注意周围一举一动  并时刻想着
be aware of your surroundings and always be thinking

464
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,585
附近可能就有一头熊
that there could be a bear nearby.

465
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:45,355
它们会四处走动  但你察觉不到
They'll move around. You won't hear them.

466
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,555
不给糖就捣乱
Hi! Trick or treat!

467
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:50,435
有时我们称它们为幽灵
We kind of refer to them sometimes as ghosts,

468
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:51,925
因为它就在你眼皮底下消失了
cos they'll just disappear on you.

469
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,005
又在另一处出现  然后呢  会去哪里
They'll be there, then, "Where did it go?"

470
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:58,815
这样想还挺惊悚的
A little spooky that way.

471
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:05,665
它们的速度出奇地快  动作敏捷
They're amazingly fast, amazingly agile,

472
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:07,445
而且悄无声息
and amazingly stealthful.

473
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:11,725
不给糖就捣乱
Trick or treat!

474
00:43:16,035 --> 00:43:19,365
-你们好  怎么样  -玩"不给糖就捣乱"呢
- Hi, guys! How you doin'?  - Trick or treat.

475
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:20,235
在要糖吃
Trick or treat?

476
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,805
有北极熊出没吗
Have you seen any bears?

477
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:23,035
没有  今夜很太平
No, it's been good tonight.

478
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,125
早些时候是有一头出现在镇上
There was a bear in town earlier today.

479
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,625
但今晚一切平安无事
But there's been nothing tonight at all.

480
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,225
听到了吗  我们很安全
Did you hear that? We're safe.

481
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:30,715
祝你们玩得愉快
You have a good night tonight, OK?

482
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:34,085
要对北极熊保持警惕  好不好
Keep your eyes open for polar bears too, OK?

483
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:35,385
-谢谢  -再见
- Thank you, guys.  - Bye-bye!

484
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,915
-万圣节快乐  -回见  小灰熊
- Happy Halloween!  - See you, little bear!

485
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,115
万圣节快乐呦
Happy Halloweenie!

486
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:48,795
今晚  丘吉尔市的居民安然无恙
Tonight, the residents of Churchill are safe,

487
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:53,525
但他们并不知道刚好逃过一劫
but it was a closer call than many of them realised.

488
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:57,795
捕熊陷阱内的情况即可证明
Inside this bear trap is proof

489
00:43:57,795 --> 00:43:59,495
要糖的人们并不是
trick-or-treaters weren't the only ones

490
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:01,885
昨晚唯一在街上晃悠的
on the streets last night.

491
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:05,635
被海豹肉诱捕进笼的这头熊
Lured into the cage by seal meat,

492
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:08,295
是头雄性北极熊  重达半吨
this male weighs over half a ton.

493
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:17,565
打了镇静剂后被运往
This bear is sedated and will be flown

494
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:20,205
60公里以外远离城镇的郊外
at least 60 kilometres outside of town.

495
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,385
在以往
In the past,

496
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:32,095
平均每年有75头入侵的北极熊
an average of 75 bears per year

497
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:34,085
被运出丘吉尔市
have been transported out of Churchill.

498
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:41,065
不过近年来
But in recent years,

499
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:43,515
这个数字已经减少了一半
the number of invading bears has halved

500
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,445
因为在北极的这片地区
because in this part of the Arctic,

501
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:47,305
北极熊数量正逐年下降
polar bears are in decline.

502
00:44:58,265 --> 00:44:59,795
他们计算了镇静剂的用量
They have timed the sedative

503
00:44:59,795 --> 00:45:02,565
这样着陆后不久  北极熊就会苏醒过来
so that it wears off soon after they land

504
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:07,195
这样做是为了保护它
This is done so that bears can protect themselves

505
00:45:07,195 --> 00:45:09,375
不会受到同地区其他北极熊的伤害
from other bears in the area.

506
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:11,225
对温沙警官而言
For Officer Windsor,

507
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,285
这意味着在熊完全醒来前
it means working fast

508
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:15,935
要迅速完成任务
before this bear fully wakes up.

509
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,545
否则这样一头雄性北极熊的一巴掌
A single swipe from a male

510
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:21,635
也可能是致命的
this size could be fatal.

511
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:30,315
把它们放生的感觉很好
It's a great feeling cos here it is, you're letting them go.

512
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:33,805
你不禁会好奇它接下来会去哪里
You can't help but wonder where's it going to be going,

513
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:35,095
如何生活
how is it going to make out.

514
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:40,795
看到一头熊再爬起来
Very satisfying to see a bear

515
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:42,835
继续它的道路  这种感觉很满足
actually get up and go on its way.

516
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:50,925
希望它一切都好
Wish 'em well, hope for the best,

517
00:45:50,925 --> 00:45:52,635
也希望不要再在镇上看到它
and hope to never seem 'em again in town.

518
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:05,075
随着海面迅速结冰
With the sea ice forming fast,

519
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:07,675
这头北极熊很快就能在
it won't be long before this polar bear

520
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:10,515
宽广的冰面上悠哉觅食了
can roam far and wide in search of food.

521
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:16,945
但对于北极周围居住的人类而言
But for people, moving around the Arctic

522
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:19,495
却更为危险了
is about to get a lot more treacherous,

523
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:22,045
因为太阳正渐渐离他们而去
because the sun is deserting them.

524
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:26,855
现在是十一月  格陵兰岛的伊卢利萨特
It's November in Ilulissat, Greenland,

525
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:29,775
太阳将不再从海平面上升起
and the sun no longer rises above the horizon.

526
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:35,795
接下来的54天  人们看不见日光
The residents won't see daylight for another 54 days.

527
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:40,655
他们努力做到和平时一样
They try to live their lives as normal.

528
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:42,785
依旧打渔捕猎
They still hunt and fish.

529
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:46,425
大人们去工作
Adults go to work.

530
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:50,585
孩子们去上学
Children go to school.

531
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:56,165
但这一切都笼罩在黑暗之中
But it's all under the cover of darkness.

532
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:04,995
当黑暗的日子绵延不止
As the dark days drag on,

533
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:09,095
每个人都渴望阳光的再次降临
everybody yearns for the sun to come back.

534
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:24,135
终于  在1月13日
Finally, on January 13th,

535
00:47:24,135 --> 00:47:25,715
他们的愿望实现了
they get their wish.

536
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,235
所有人都出门庆贺
The entire community comes out to celebrate

537
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:31,535
迎接新年的第一缕阳光
the first sunrise of the new year.

538
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:39,445
生生不息的太阳

539
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:43,305
...照亮了黑夜中的灵魂

540
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:48,405
...普洒大地的阳光

541
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:47,665
每一次黎明的到来  都逐渐让北极变暖
With every new sunrise, the Arctic is warming up.

542
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:54,425
...驱散了内心的寒冷

543
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:54,955
而在未来的几年中  由于季节变迁
And the seasonal opportunities that have made life possible

544
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,865
人们赖以生存的自然条件也许会不复存在
may not be here in years to come.

545
00:48:00,455 --> 00:48:04,365
但是北极圈的居民们生而顽强
However, the people of the Arctic are born survivors.

546
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:09,285
如果说有谁能够适应即将来临的变化
If there's anyone who can adapt to the changes on the horizon,

547
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,325
那便是他们
surely it's them.

548
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:17,205
人类星球

549
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:17,205
镜头背后的故事

550
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:23,325
对于北极小分队来说
For the Arctic team,

551
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:26,235
捕猎独角鲸的挑战不小
the narwhal hunt was always going to be a challenge.

552
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,445
捕猎通常在春天进行
The hunt happens in the spring,

553
00:48:30,445 --> 00:48:34,055
但那时海面冰层最为脆弱危险
when the sea ice is at its most fragile and dangerous.

554
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,445
尽管知道有风险  但没有人能预计到
Even knowing the risks, no-one could have foreseen

555
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,125
在这变幻莫测的土地上
quite how much drama

556
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:53,185
他们会得到怎样戏剧性的际遇
they would face in this treacherous place.

557
00:48:54,935 --> 00:49:01,405
格陵兰  卡纳克
北纬77°28’48” 西经69°21’36”

558
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,035
冰雪上的第一天
Day one on the ice,

559
00:49:03,035 --> 00:49:06,895
经验丰富的摄制组和极地摄影师道格・艾伦
and the experienced crew, including polar cameraman Doug Allan,

560
00:49:06,895 --> 00:49:08,875
都忙于将行装搬运到雪橇上
are busy loading the sleds.

561
00:49:09,245 --> 00:49:13,085
这就是六个人在冰天雪地要度过两周
This is what you need to take six people onto the ice

562
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:15,505
道格・艾伦
摄影师

563
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:14,825
所需的全部行装
for a fortnight.

564
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:16,575
东西真挺多的  是吧
It's a hell of a lot of stuff, isn't it?

565
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:21,235
我们六人有共计约400公斤的行装
We've probably got about 400 kilos between six people.

566
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:25,575
西蒙・福瑞斯特
录音师

567
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:24,415
所以  要说我们是轻装上阵
So, to say we're travelling light is possibly

568
00:49:24,415 --> 00:49:26,195
是有点夸张了
a little understatement!

569
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:28,995
每辆雪橇上坐一个人和一部分行装
With the kit and a person on board,

570
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:32,435
因此每辆的负重约在100公斤左右
each dogsled is having to carry about 100 kilos of freight,

571
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,935
这对于12条雪橇犬来说实在有些重
which is quite a lot, really, between 12 dogs.

572
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:42,195
但饲养它们就是为了派上这个用场
But this is what these dogs are bred for,

573
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:44,095
它们做起来也得心应手
and they're in their element.

574
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:47,465
他们动身穿越27公里的冰面
They set off across 27 kilometres

575
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:49,245
抵达无冰的海面
of sea ice to open water.

576
00:49:50,785 --> 00:49:54,045
马穆拉  葛迪恩和米克莱三兄弟
Three brothers, Mamarut, Gedion and Mikele,

577
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:56,735
应邀带领着摄制组去捕独角鲸
lead the crew on their quest for narwhal.

578
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:06,075
仅仅几个小时以后
After only a couple of hours,

579
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:09,275
探险队就看到了第一个危险讯号
the expedition encounters their first sign of danger.

580
00:50:11,235 --> 00:50:14,245
你可以清楚地看到这里的冰层在移动
You can quite distinctly see the movement here.

581
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,665
此处隆起是由无冰海域的海水涌进引起的
The swell's coming in from the open ocean

582
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:17,395
它使得冰层开始破裂
and it's breaking it up.

583
00:50:17,395 --> 00:50:18,935
此处小裂痕
And this little crack here,

584
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:20,815
能容纳一指宽度
which you can put your finger down,

585
00:50:20,815 --> 00:50:24,135
也许是15分钟前形成的  且还会扩大
maybe 15 minutes from now, it's going to be this wide.

586
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:27,185
再过半小时  它就会宽到跨都跨不过了
Half an hour, it will be too wide to cross.

587
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:29,065
必须得小心应对
You have to be careful.

588
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:30,635
这片冰层时时刻刻都在移动
This ice is on the move all the time.

589
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:35,115
因纽特猎人们认为冰层太不稳定
The Inuit hunters decide the ice is too unstable

590
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,245
探险被迫折返到安全的陆面上
and the expedition is forced back to the safety of land.

591
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,595
经历五个半小时
After five and a half hours of travelling,

592
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:45,205
我们已经穿过了海湾口
we've come all the way across the...the inlet.

593
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:47,435
但冰层仍不稳定
The ice edge is still unstable

594
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:49,095
因此我觉得我们得在这过夜
so I think we'll wait the night out here

595
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:51,195
明天看看情况如何再做决定
and then maybe have a look-see tomorrow.

596
00:50:53,155 --> 00:50:54,595
次日早晨
The next morning,

597
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:57,995
他们小心地跨过冰缝走向雪橇
they pick their way across broken tidal ice to the sleds,

598
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:00,075
去查探情况如何
to check out the situation.

599
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:03,385
我很庆幸猎人们昨日做出了明智的决定
I'm pleased the hunters made the decision they did,

600
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:04,465
因为昨晚
as overnight,

601
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:08,585
冰架塌陷了近三四公里
we've lost three or four kilometres of the ice shelf,

602
00:51:08,585 --> 00:51:12,065
而且那个方向的冰层仍在继续迅速消失
which is now disappearing rapidly in that direction.

603
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:15,585
随着我们进入峡湾
As we were coming into the fjord,

604
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:18,405
我们实际上又与来路交叉了
we actually crossed our tracks,

605
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:20,965
但来路已经融化成了海洋
and they disappeared into the water,

606
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:22,535
想起来实在是后怕
which was quite a sobering thought.

607
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:26,835
当他们真的到达冰层尽头时
When they do reach the edge,

608
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,355
他们简直不敢相信自己运气这么好
they can't believe their luck,

609
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:30,915
因为马穆拉很快就看到了一些独角鲸
as Mamarut quickly spots some narwhal.

610
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:36,235
我们在远处的冰层边缘看到了一些独角鲸
We've just seen some narwhal further along the ice edge,

611
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:39,565
大伙们都开始去准备独木舟了
so the guys are getting the kayaks ready

612
00:51:39,565 --> 00:51:41,415
独角鲸一旦靠近
because if the narwhals come close,

613
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:43,045
他们就会试图捕捉
they might try to hunt them.

614
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:48,605
道格已经准备好捕捉那一刻了
Doug's ready to capture the action.

615
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,975
但正当葛迪恩要落下鱼叉时
But just when Gedion is in position to harpoon,

616
00:51:53,975 --> 00:51:56,205
独角鲸下潜了
the narwhal dives.

617
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:04,245
他们等待着  期望鲸鱼再度浮出水面
They wait and hope for the whales to resurface.

618
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:08,075
现在是凌晨一点钟
It's now one o'clock in the morning.

619
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:10,605
我们已在此蹲点十二个小时了
We've been here for about 12 hours.

620
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,905
独角鲸已离去
The narwhal have gone

621
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:17,235
但猎人们坚信它们还会再回来的
but the hunters are still sure that they're going to come back,

622
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,035
我们依然在等待
and we're still waiting,

623
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,715
并且开始变得非常疲惫
and we're all getting very tired.

624
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:28,745
全日不休的阳光融化了表层的冰
24-hour daylight melts the ice from above,

625
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,905
海浪不停地在冰下鼓动着
and ocean swells stress the ice from beneath.

626
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:35,715
在这里扎营并不安全
It's not the safest place to camp,

627
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:39,045
但他们必须在冰层边缘等待独角鲸归来
but they must wait at the edge for the narwhals' return.

628
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:43,475
等待由以天计变成了以周计
The days start to run into weeks

629
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:46,095
摄制组不得不延长拍摄计划
and the crew have to extend their shoot.

630
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:51,915
我们在此已停留了三周之久
It's almost three weeks now that we've been on location

631
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,445
而这就是问题所在
and this...this is the problem

632
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:55,555
冰
ice.

633
00:52:56,775 --> 00:53:00,075
这下面肯定有独角鲸
And somewhere under here are the narwhals.

634
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:01,835
这真叫人沮丧
It's really frustrating.

635
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:08,515
现在  天气也对他们不利了
Next, it's the weather that turns against them.

636
00:53:09,475 --> 00:53:13,555
真是祸不单行啊  是吧
It's just one thing after another, isn't it?

637
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,475
我要告诉你我无聊到了什么程度
I'll tell you how bored I am.

638
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:24,675
什么程度
How bored are you?

639
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:26,515
我今早把我的帐篷移了位
I moved my tent this morning.

640
00:53:26,515 --> 00:53:29,555
这是我这三天内做过最有意思的事情了
That was the most exciting thing I've done in three days.

641
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:31,635
我把它移动了六英尺
And I moved it six feet.

642
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:35,475
我有种成就感  终于感觉自己做了点事
It gave me a sense of satisfaction, cos I'd done something!

643
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,825
日子一天天过去  气温升高冰层变薄
As the days pass, the temperature rises and the ice thins,

644
00:53:42,825 --> 00:53:45,245
风险也增加了
increasing the chance of something going wrong.

645
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,375
浪头越来越近...

646
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:54,135
我们也许得拔营回寨了

647
00:53:56,395 --> 00:53:58,835
听到了吗  听到了吗  快听
Did you hear it? Did you hear it? Oh, listen, listen!

648
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:03,845
尼古拉斯・布朗
《人类星球》导演

649
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:03,455
冰层在破裂  我们脚下的冰层在破裂
It's cracking... It's cracking right underneath us right now.

650
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,855
因为有雪覆盖因此你们看不到
You can't see it cos there's snow on top of it.

651
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:08,655
就像有声音  "E啦"
There was like, "Crunch!"

652
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:14,355
这是捕鲸的最好时机  完美的光线
It's perfect narwhal conditions, perfect light,

653
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:16,095
完美的一切
perfect everything,

654
00:54:16,095 --> 00:54:18,155
现在有涌浪
and what's happening, we've got swell.

655
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:21,995
涌浪能使任何地方的海冰破裂
The swell can fracture the sea ice literally anywhere.

656
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:23,935
这可不是好消息
That's not good news.

657
00:54:23,935 --> 00:54:27,345
所以现在得快点离开  去安全地带
So, it's time to leave here and head to safer ground.

658
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:31,995
平时闲散的因纽特人加快了脚步
The normally laid-back Inuit up their pace,

659
00:54:31,995 --> 00:54:34,995
摄制组也意识到了情况的严重性
and the crew realise the situation is serious.

660
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:36,995
走  快走
Go! Go!

661
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:39,745
必须要走了
Gotta go.

662
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:51,835
我们和卡纳克之间的路段...

663
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,595
...情况看起来不妙啊

664
00:54:53,595 --> 00:54:55,905
有处裂缝宽达100码[90米]左右...

665
00:54:55,905 --> 00:54:58,715
...它将在二三十分钟内彻底裂开

666
00:54:59,615 --> 00:55:03,305
他们现在是真正的如履薄冰
They are all now cast adrift on an ice floe.

667
00:55:03,535 --> 00:55:06,455
贝唐・埃文斯
《人类星球》研究组成员

668
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:06,335
我不知道我们到底要怎样才能离开这
I don't know how the hell we're going to get off this now!

669
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:10,105
现在情况紧急
They're facing an emergency

670
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:12,595
大家的关注点都变为  如何险中求生
and everyone's focus turns to survival.

671
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:15,915
别拍了  拜托
Stop this, please.

672
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:23,425
整个探险队正以惊人的速度撤离
The whole expedition is now floating away at an alarming rate.

673
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:29,555
全队共计有十三人  五十四只狗
There are 13 people, 54 dogs

674
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,955
六架雪橇的行装等待被转移至安全地带
and six sleds of kit to get to safety.

675
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:37,975
葛迪恩已爬进了他的小独木舟
Gedion has got into his canoe

676
00:55:37,975 --> 00:55:42,675
正带着一根结实的引线  拼命划过冰缝
and is paddling furiously across the lead with a very fine trace wire,

677
00:55:42,675 --> 00:55:45,455
看起来他们会用一根更粗的绳子
onto which, by the looks of it, they will put a much thicker rope,

678
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:48,235
在另一边来牵引雪橇过去
to physically haul from the other side the sleds across,

679
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:51,235
这办法很聪明  因为雪橇浮力不错
which is very clever, cos they float - amazing.

680
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:54,995
速度很重要
Speed is of the essence,

681
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:58,235
因为风把队伍吹得离陆地越来越远
as the wind blows the team further and further from land.

682
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:03,755
此处海水的温度会把人冻死
The sea temperature here can kill in minutes.

683
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,965
小心行驶不翻船是值得的
It pays not to rock the boat.

684
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:13,315
把重要的东西放上来
Get the important stuff on!

685
00:56:13,755 --> 00:56:16,515
大家伙做得好
Well, the guys have done great.

686
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:20,185
很好  别拍打  他们知道该怎么办
Very impressed. No flap. They knew what to do.

687
00:56:22,135 --> 00:56:24,335
经过四小时的运输
After four hours ferrying,

688
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:27,205
行装和摄制组都安全抵达对岸
the kit and crew reach the other side safely.

689
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:33,445
但不通水性的五十四只狗仍在对岸
But that still leaves 54 water-shy dogs.

690
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:51,235
而在对岸的那些  回家依然遥不可及
On the other side, they're still far from home

691
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:53,955
所立之冰层又正在破裂
and on ice that's breaking up around them.

692
00:56:56,395 --> 00:56:58,195
这是在和时间赛跑
It's a race against time,

693
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:01,965
他们离安全的村庄仍有十公里以上的距离
as over 10km before they reach the safety of the village.

694
00:57:04,195 --> 00:57:05,755
家乡近在眼前
Within sight of home,

695
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,355
一群缺乏经验的狗犯了个严重的错误
an inexperienced dog team makes a serious error.

696
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:23,655
一条被忽视的裂痕在离村庄数米处出现
An unseen crack has opened up just metres from the village.

697
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,845
裂缝再大一点 这满载物资的雪橇
Any wider and the fully laden sledge

698
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:28,875
就会直沉海底
would sink to the bottom,

699
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,915
且会一并拖下拉车的狗
dragging the dogs under.

700
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:36,195
有条狗被困在雪橇下了
There's a dog trapped under the sledge

701
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:40,955
但它却奇迹般地没有受伤
but, miraculously, even this one emerges unharmed.

702
00:57:42,915 --> 00:57:45,485
道格和摄制组其他人看到这幕
Doug and the rest of crew spot the problem

703
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:47,185
便避开了那条道
and find a better route home.

704
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:53,085
在冰层重新变得足够安全
It was another week before the ice was safe enough

705
00:57:53,085 --> 00:57:56,255
能拍摄捕鲸之前  他们又等了一周
for the crew to film the full narwhal hunt sequence.

706
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,315
在这里  生存与否全凭对环境的了解
This shoot, more than any other,

707
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,435
与其他拍摄过程相比  这次经历
highlights the importance of the complete trust

708
00:58:03,435 --> 00:58:07,155
尤其证明了《人类星球》摄制组
between the Human Planet crew and the local Inuit,

709
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:12,075
与因纽特人间的互相信任  至关重要
in a place where knowing your environment is the key to survival.
