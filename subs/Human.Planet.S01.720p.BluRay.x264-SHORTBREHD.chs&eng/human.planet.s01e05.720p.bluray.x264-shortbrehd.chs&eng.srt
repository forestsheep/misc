1
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,779
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,009
在地球的每一个角落留下了印迹
in every habitat on Earth.

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,869
那就是人类
That creature is us.

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:19,009
天地悠悠
All over the world we still

5
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:23,379
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

6
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:25,739
远离文明开化的城市
far from the city lights,

7
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,099
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

8
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,339
绵延的山脉是地球上最为恶劣的环境之一
Mountains are among the most brutal environments on earth.

9
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,589
天气可以在数小时之内由酷热变为极寒
Weather here can shift from tropical to arctic in just hours.

10
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,359
海拔越高的地方  环境越为恶劣
And the higher you climb, the tougher it gets,

11
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,709
直到连氧气都消失殆尽
until even oxygen is stripped away.

12
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:18,689
然而  数百万人口居住于此
But millions of people live in the mountains,

13
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:26,359
或在困境中求得一席之地
either seeking refuge from conflict

14
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,999
或开发特有资源
or exploiting resources found nowhere else.

15
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,869
因此  他们不得不采用
And to survive they have had to adapt

16
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,509
令人惊叹并充满智慧的生存方式
in the most surprising and ingenious ways.

17
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,789
这就是他们的故事
These are their stories.

18
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:17,659
山区

19
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,659
空气稀薄之地的生活

20
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,289
阿尔泰山位于蒙古境内
The Altai mountains in mongolia

21
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,379
是世界上最为偏僻的地区之一
are among the most remote on earth.

22
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,999
对于生活在这个贫瘠之地的人们来说
And for the people who live in this barren landscape,

23
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,849
捕猎几乎是不可能的
hunting is nearly impossible.

24
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,589
除非你有帮手
Unless you have help.

25
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,769
塞劳・扎迪克和他儿子贝瑞克是哈萨克族人
Sailau Jadik and his son Berik are Kazakhs.

26
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,709
今天他们要寻找一个最佳捕猎搭档
And today they're in search of the ultimate hunting partner.

27
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,619
一只金鹰
A golden eagle.

28
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,209
有一只鹰当搭档的话...

29
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:11,789
就可以捕捉到任何猎物

30
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,329
它是地球上的最佳猎手

31
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,889
小鹰们已为离巢做好准备
These young birds are almost ready to leave the nest.

32
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,349
如果十六岁的贝瑞克能抓到一只小鹰
If 16-year-old Berik can collect one,

33
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,699
在成为他父亲那样的哈萨克猎手之路上
he will take his first step towards becoming a Kazakh hunter

34
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,449
就迈出了第一步
like his father.

35
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,549
这可是意义非凡的第一步
It's a big first step.

36
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,819
小心点

37
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:13,599
别踩到小鹰

38
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,699
自从大约二百年前
Ever since the Kazakhs fled

39
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,079
哈萨克族人逃到这片山区以来
into these mountains nearly 200 years ago,

40
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,969
他们就一直在窃取雏鹰
they have been stealing baby eagles.

41
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:35,299
鹰的视力比人类的强很多
Eagles have eyes many times more powerful than a human's

42
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,079
能看到两公里以内的猎物
and can spot prey two kilometres away.

43
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,259
贝瑞克如果能驯化这只鹰为他捕猎
If Berik can teach this eagle to hunt for him,

44
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,839
他就能加入哈萨克族为数不多的猎手行列
he will join the few hundred Kazakhs left who can still do this.

45
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:57,649
干得好贝瑞克  这只鹰非常好

46
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,959
贝瑞克给这只小鹰取名为巴拉潘
Berik calls his new eagle Balapan.

47
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:13,269
如果训练得好  巴拉潘会成为他的捕猎搭档
If he gets it right, Balapan will become his hunting partner.

48
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,339
但是要训练上五个月
But training her will take five months.

49
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,729
五个月后
It's five months later,

50
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,649
是贝瑞克和羽翼丰满的巴拉潘
and time for Berik and a fully grown Balapan

51
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,009
一起去首次捕猎的时候了
to go on their first hunt together.

52
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,129
他们正在追赶一直蒙古狐狸
They're after a Mongolian fox,

53
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,299
这种动物难以追捕
an animal so elusive,

54
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,389
只有老鹰有机会抓住它
only an eagle stands a chance of catching it.

55
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,589
为了让巴拉潘捕捉到这只狐狸
But for Balapan to catch the fox,

56
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,639
贝瑞克首先要把她带到高地
Berik first has to take her to high ground.

57
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:09,949
在这里  她有一个最佳的视角
Here she'll have the perfect

58
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,009
任何细微的移动都无法从她眼中逃脱
vantage point to spot the slightest movement.

59
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,699
仔细看  我觉得狐狸藏在那边

60
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:25,059
在那些岩石里面

61
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,519
听我的指示  让鹰做好准备

62
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,819
当她看见鹰的时候  立刻放开她

63
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:46,949
贝瑞克希望巴拉潘的猎捕本能发挥作用
Berik now hopes that Balapan's hunting instinct will take over.

64
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,049
准备

65
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,509
巴拉潘失败了
Balapan has failed.

66
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,049
对于贝瑞克而言  这让他担忧
For Berik, this is worrying.

67
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,679
她有没有当猎手的潜质呢
Does she have the killer instinct?

68
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,029
一般来讲  哈萨克族猎手
Traditionally, Kazakh hunters

69
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,599
和他们的鹰会朝夕相处长达七年
pair up with their eagles for seven years

70
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,379
然后让它们回归自然
before setting them free,

71
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,499
但此刻贝瑞克产生了怀疑
but Berik now has his doubts.

72
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,979
不要担心

73
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:18,849
她从未见过那样跳跃的狐狸

74
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,719
明天就会成功的

75
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,109
破晓时分  父子二人再次来到了这个山头
As day breaks, father and son return to the mountains.

76
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:48,369
如果巴拉潘抓不到狐狸
If Balapan can't catch a fox,

77
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:52,339
贝瑞克只能将她放走  再找一只鹰来训练
Berik may have to let her go and find another eagle to train.

78
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:01,969
巴拉潘抓到了狐狸  就如平时训练的那样
Balapan has caught the fox, just as she was trained to.

79
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,779
现在她要奋力困住狐狸
She's now locked in a fight to the death.

80
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:39,849
塞劳以最快的速度杀死狐狸
Sailau kills the fox as quickly as he can.

81
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,729
按照哈萨克族的传统
According to Kazakh tradition,

82
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,949
巴拉潘可以食用狐狸的内脏
Balapan gets the fox's lungs.

83
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,889
狐狸的皮毛可以用来做冬衣
The fox's thick coat will be used for winter clothing.

84
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:06,159
贝瑞克证明了自己是名优秀的哈萨克猎人
Berik has proved himself to be a successful Kazakh hunter.

85
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,859
恭喜你  我的儿子

86
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:15,939
我为你骄傲

87
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:20,509
你现在是一个真正的哈萨克人了

88
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,189
只要哈萨克人居住在阿尔泰山地区
As long as they have lived in the Altai Mountains,

89
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,009
他们就要依靠鹰来生活
Kazakhs have relied on eagles.

90
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,909
然而  不是所有山区人民
However, not all mountain people

91
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,409
都要依靠野生动物生活的
get help from wild animals.

92
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,629
在东非大裂谷边缘地带
On the edge of Africa's Great Rift Valley,

93
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,559
地质变动造就了埃塞俄比亚瑟门山脉
geological upheaval has created Ethiopia's Simien mountains.

94
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,079
在这里  巨大的悬崖形成了一个天然屏障
Here, giant cliffs form a natural fortress

95
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:58,529
为这里受战争影响几个世纪的人们
where for centuries people

96
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,199
提供了一个庇护所
have sought refuge from conflicts below.

97
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,239
盖比村是上百个位于
Getabit village is one of

98
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,379
高地的村庄中的一个
a hundred perched in a landscape so vertical

99
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,239
村民们只能在
that the residents can

100
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,959
悬崖边缘的小块土地上
only grow their crops on tiny strips of land

101
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,079
种些农作物
along the edges of cliffs.

102
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,729
七百英尺高的悬崖并不是他们最担心的事
But 700-foot precipices are the least of their worries.

103
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,929
今天正是每年的丰收时节
Today their annual harvest is under way,

104
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,169
他们要保护粮食远离敌人贪婪的魔掌
and their grain is under attack from a ravenous enemy.

105
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,869
敌人就是狮尾狒狒
These are gelada monkeys

106
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,469
他们喜偷农民的粮食
and they love stealing the farmers' grain.

107
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,549
六百多只狒狒潜伏在盖比村附近
Troops of up to 600 prowl the cliffs surrounding Getabit village,

108
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,619
由雄性狒狒带领  其獠牙长于狮子
led by males with fangs larger than a lion's.

109
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,589
他们是狡猾的窃贼
They are cunning thieves.

110
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,389
为了抵御狒狒的攻击
To defend their crops against the monkeys,

111
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,979
农民们让孩子来保护粮食
the cliff farmers depend on their children,

112
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,879
比如  这个十二岁的德杰
such as 12-year-old Dereje.

113
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:20,799
狒狒的力气很大

114
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,059
它们杀死过很多羊

115
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,839
很多人都被它们伤过

116
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,319
滚开

117
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:40,609
我非常讨厌它们

118
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,519
由于这里靠近国家公园
Because the area is next to a national park,

119
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,249
所以狮尾狒狒是受保护的
the gelada are protected.

120
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,519
滚开

121
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:59,169
杀一只狒狒就要坐七年牢

122
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,069
所以只能吓跑它们

123
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:12,099
夜幕降临  狒狒停止进攻
As night approaches, the geladas stop raiding.

124
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,089
而德杰家的粮食正在等待收割
But Dereje's crops are ripe for harvest,

125
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,409
他明白
and he knows that tomorrow

126
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:25,579
明天狒狒的攻击会比以往更加激烈
the monkeys will attack even more aggressively than before.

127
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:30,979
所以他和兄妹们在地里守夜
So, with his two sisters and brother, he camps by his fields.

128
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,689
它们今天吃了很多粮食

129
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,159
如果它们来一大群怎么办呢

130
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,129
大的我来搞定

131
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,259
你必须勇敢面对

132
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,499
赶走它

133
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:58,789
晚上  气温骤降到零下
At night, temperatures plummet below freezing.

134
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,459
虽然有着厚厚皮毛的狒狒适应这样的温度
While the thick-furred geladas have adapted to the cold,

135
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,279
但人类不得不抱作一团相互取暖
the humans must huddle together for warmth.

136
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,709
黎明时刻  狒狒来袭
At dawn, the geladas attack.

137
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,009
第一次进攻有几只大的雄性狒狒
The first strike comes from a few large males,

138
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,279
目标就是德杰看守的干草堆
who target Dereje's haystacks.

139
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,209
德杰赶走了它们
He drives them off,

140
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,359
但狒狒是如此狡猾
but the geladas are cunning

141
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,549
这几只只是声东击西的诱饵
these males were only a decoy.

142
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,269
德杰家土地的另一边在视野之外
Out of sight at the other end of Dereje's fields,

143
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:45,969
大部队来临  一场真正的掠夺开始了
the main army launches the real attack.

144
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,979
这么多的狒狒几分钟就能将作物消灭干净
A big troop like this can strip a field in minutes.

145
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,759
看着点  狒狒正在偷吃

146
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,589
它们在庄稼地里

147
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,969
从哪边来的

148
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,189
在另一边偷吃粮食

149
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,039
德杰要迅速赶到
If Dereje doesn't hurry,

150
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,789
否则他家过冬的粮食就没了
the food his family needs to get through the winter will be gone.

151
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,069
德杰成功了  他赶走了狒狒
Dereje's done it. He's seen off the gelada.

152
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,319
终于  他们满载而归
Finally, his crops are harvested.

153
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:20,809
粮食安全了  我很高兴

154
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,549
现在能在家里睡觉了

155
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,409
德杰生活在瑟门山区
Dereje lives in the Simiens

156
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,249
是因为几百年前他的祖先逃难于此
because his ancestors sought refuge here centuries ago.

157
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:40,409
然而  在世界的某些角落  人们定居山区
But in some parts of the world, people settle in mountains

158
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:44,779
是因为这里有他们极为想得到的东西
because this environment has something they desperately want.

159
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:56,269
大陆板块的撞击诞生了山脉
Mountains are born when continental plates collide.

160
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,629
这种地质巨变
This massive upheaval

161
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,009
通常会迸发出丰富而珍贵的矿物质
often exposes a wealth of valuable minerals.

162
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,219
尤以印度尼西亚而闻名
Nowhere more so than here in Indonesia,

163
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:13,199
这是地球上活火山最多的国家
home to more active volcanic mountains than any nation on Earth.

164
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,529
在这里  人们冒着生命危险
Here, people risk their lives

165
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:29,269
开采一种很多重要工业都需要的矿物质
for a mineral vital to several important industries.

166
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,739
那就是硫磺
Sulphur.

167
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,749
哈图姆和苏莱曼是硫磺的开采者
Hartomo and Sulaiman are sulphur miners.

168
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,929
今天  他们要前往极少数人才敢去的地方
Today, they're going where few others dare.

169
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,719
进入一座活火山的腹地
Into the heart of an active volcano.

170
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,989
这里有很多高山  但是只有一座有硫磺

171
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,579
这里是夷真火山口  地球上毒性最强的地方
This is Ijen crater, one of the most poisonous places on Earth.

172
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,269
在其中心  湖水中充满了
At its centre, a lake filled with

173
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,069
二百五十万吨的酸
two-and-a-half million tonnes of acid.

174
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:34,719
散发到山外的的有毒气体
And out of the depths of the mountain pour toxic gases

175
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:39,279
在过去四十年中已经令七十四名矿工丧命
that have claimed the lives of 74 miners in the past 40 years.

176
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:57,059
火山所散发的气体很危险

177
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:04,579
这能令人昏死过去

178
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:13,769
每当我们来这里  家人就会担心

179
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:20,339
这些矿工吸进的硫化氢
The hydrogen sulphide that these men must breathe in

180
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,869
是安全限度的四十倍
is 40 times the safe level.

181
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,309
久而久之  他们的肺部会受到损害
Over time, it destroys their lungs.

182
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,609
这气体很熏眼睛...

183
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,489
而且会伤到喉咙和肺部

184
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:12,429
当他们采到足够的硫磺
Once they have enough sulphur,

185
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:15,359
哈图姆和苏莱曼就将这些东西
Hartomo and Sulaiman have to carry it

186
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,339
直接运到二百米外的火山口边缘地带
200 metres straight up to the crater rim.

187
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:28,469
每个人负重九十公斤
Each man hefts 90 kilos,

188
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,109
几乎是正常负重的一倍半
nearly one-and-a-half times their own body weight.

189
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,499
这种工作在矿工的身体上留下沉重的代价
This work exacts a heavy price on the miners' bodies.

190
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:51,609
他们说在这里工作会缩短寿命

191
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:58,359
我为了养活妻儿不得如此

192
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,289
别的工作都不如这个挣得多

193
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,269
苏莱曼和哈图姆每次能获得五美元
Sulaiman and Hartomo are paid five dollars per load.

194
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,909
矿工们的生活通常很艰苦
The lives of miners have always been hard.

195
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,159
但这艰苦的生活并不仅限于矿工
But it's not just miners who have it tough.

196
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,729
一些山区的居民  寻找食物甚至成为问题
For some mountain dwellers, just finding food can be a challenge.

197
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:39,369
我们来到位于南太平洋的
In the South Pacific lies

198
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,609
世界第二大岛  新几内亚岛
the world's second largest island, New Guinea.

199
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,319
从生物学角度来讲  这是地球上
This is one of the most

200
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:51,369
最为富饶的山区之一
biologically rich mountain landscapes on Earth.

201
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:57,269
这里丰富的水资源和森林保护区
With plenty of water, and thousands of protected valleys,

202
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,039
孕育着这里的生命
these mountains brim with life.

203
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,349
但是  猎取食物却十分困难
Yet hunting for food, and particularly meat,

204
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:08,139
尤其是肉质食物
is surprisingly difficult.

205
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,679
马库斯  安德鲁和乔治是
Marcus, Andrew and George are hunters

206
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,789
央格鲁博肯族的猎手
from the Yangoru Boiken tribe.

207
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,259
他们和家人
They and their families

208
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,869
已有两星期未吃到新鲜的肉食了
haven't eaten any fresh meat for two weeks.

209
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,869
今天  他们想改善一下伙食
But today they plan to solve the problem.

210
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:40,539
他们希望能够捕捉到狐蝠
They hope to trap giant fruit bats.

211
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:52,349
如果能抓到蝙蝠  家人们就有吃的了

212
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:01,379
孩子们常问我  爸爸  你能给我带些蝙蝠肉吗

213
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:06,679
捕获狐蝠需要做一个巨大的陷阱
But to catch a giant bat requires a giant bat trap.

214
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:12,739
这三人正在进行一项浩大的工程
So these men are doing something radical.

215
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,969
他们改造着这里的地貌
They're changing the shape of the landscape itself.

216
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:27,169
沿着山脊  开辟出宽七十英尺的门道
Along this ridge, the men create a 70-foot wide doorway.

217
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:31,689
一条小路通往远处的果树林
A shortcut through the mountains to the fruit trees beyond

218
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,139
这是捕捉蝙蝠的绝佳之地
and a perfect place to ambush the bats.

219
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:47,169
祖先们教我如何捕猎

220
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:54,299
教我如何设置陷阱和网

221
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,189
像蜘蛛一样  他们织了一张巨大的网
Like spiders, the men spin a gigantic web.

222
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,049
黑夜  蝙蝠是不会察觉到
In the dark, this 130-foot

223
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,819
这张一百三十英尺高的大网的
high net cannot be detected by the bats.

224
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,419
现在只剩两件事
Only two things now remain.

225
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,019
那就是  安置蝙蝠报警信号
Add the bat alert signal

226
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,879
和祈祷蝙蝠的到来
and pray the bats fly into their trap.

227
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,749
捕捉蝙蝠需要耐心
Catching bats requires patience.

228
00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:00,829
以前  马库斯曾经在森林中等待数星期
In the past, Marcus has spent weeks on the mountain

229
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,949
却空手而归
and come home empty-handed.

230
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:08,529
但如果他能抓到几只蝙蝠
But if he does manage to catch even a few,

231
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,789
所作出的努力还是值得的
the effort will be worthwhile.

232
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:17,459
一只蝙蝠配上些大米
可以供给十二个人

233
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,729
有蝙蝠  有蝙蝠

234
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,039
在网里  快点儿

235
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:47,089
逃走前先杀了它

236
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,769
这只大的公蝙蝠够几个人吃的了

237
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:01,539
这是个好的开始  但是家中连月的口粮
It's a good start, but with all the mouths to feed at home,

238
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:04,079
需要更多的蝙蝠
they're going to need more than one bat.

239
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:13,849
时间一点点过去  他们继续捕捉蝙蝠
As the hours roll on, their trap continues to catch bats.

240
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:24,559
夜里  他们共捕到十五只蝙蝠
In the course of the night, the men catch a total of 15 bats.

241
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,099
现在煮熟了两只  余下的被保存起来
They cook two now and save the rest.

242
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,729
这些收获能够提供给家人们
Their haul will provide their families

243
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,299
两星期的蛋白质了
with enough protein for two weeks.

244
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,759
这肉的味道好极了

245
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,039
蝙蝠的每个部位都可以吃
Every part of the bat is edible,

246
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,229
甚至是翅膀上的皮
down to the leather on the wings.

247
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,009
对于安德鲁  马库斯和乔治来说
For Andrew, Marcus and George,

248
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,469
只有熟知他们所生活的每寸土地
knowing every inch of their mountain habitat

249
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,949
才能够养活家人
enables them to feed their families.

250
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,789
然而  严寒地带  熟知每寸土地
But in colder climes, knowing every inch of your mountain

251
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,609
却是生死一线的转机
can mean the difference between life and death.

252
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,799
在瑞士的阿尔卑斯山脉  全年降雪达十米厚
In the Swiss Alps, ten metres of snow can fall in a year.

253
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,559
对于几百万的滑雪爱好者来说
And for millions of skiers,

254
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,989
这是个圣地
this is a brilliant reason to come here.

255
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,609
但是暴雪也能构成生存威胁
But heavy snowfalls can also pose a deadly threat.

256
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:56,559
雪崩
Avalanches.

257
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,449
速度快于高速列车
Travelling faster than a bullet train,

258
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:17,719
雪崩所到之处  一切化为虚无
a major avalanche annihilates everything in its path.

259
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,419
过去的每个冬季
In any given winter,

260
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,089
仅在阿尔卑斯山脉就有三万场雪崩
there can be 30,000 avalanches in the Swiss Alps alone.

261
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:50,189
巡视员马丁・麦斯是一位雪崩观测员
Ski patrolman Martin Mathys is an avalanche spotter.

262
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,189
今天  他发现了一个问题
And today he has a big problem.

263
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,759
在他的家乡格林德瓦
In his hometown of Grindelwald,

264
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,909
已降雪多天
there has been a massive snowfall.

265
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:03,079
极有可能发生雪崩
The risk of avalanche is now extreme.

266
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:10,709
雪崩能毁灭汽车和火车

267
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,179
掩埋公路...

268
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:20,449
...和村庄

269
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:31,489
我的工作是在雪崩发生前将其制服

270
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,539
在格林德瓦之上  矗立着一千米高山峰
Towering 1,000 metres above Grindelwald

271
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:41,329
那便是耸人听闻的黑角山
is the notorious Black Horn ridge.

272
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,009
被积雪覆盖  马上就会爆发一场灾难
Packed with snow, it's a disaster waiting to happen.

273
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:52,209
在更多的积雪覆盖之前
So Martin must set off a controlled avalanche now

274
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,329
马丁必须立即采取措施
before any more snow falls.

275
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:05,289
紧急情况时  我们使用直升飞机

276
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:09,819
只有这样  才能安全地靠近

277
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,409
为了控制雪崩
To set off a controlled avalanche,

278
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,969
需要大量炸药
you need dynamite, plenty of it.

279
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:23,699
马丁带了五十公斤炸药  足够炸毁几个街区
Martin is taking 50 kilos, enough to blow up several city blocks.

280
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,239
这么多的雪令我的工作忙碌起来

281
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,189
我感到肾上腺素分泌

282
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:45,779
...但并不害怕

283
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:03,959
马丁到达黑角山的峰顶
Martin reaches the summit of the Black Horn ridge,

284
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,349
准备好炸药
and sets a charge.

285
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:32,029
他引发了一场微型雪崩  转移十多吨雪
He triggers a mini avalanche, shifting over ten tonnes of snow.

286
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:35,679
但这远远不够  他需要再次引发
But it's not enough. He needs to go again.

287
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,009
这一次  马丁成功了
This time, Martin succeeds.

288
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,249
这场人工雪崩令山区人民处于安全之中
This is the avalanche he needs to make the mountain safe.

289
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:21,999
大自然的力量非常强大...

290
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,639
雪崩是我们生活的一部分

291
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,509
我们时刻准备着

292
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,269
生活在阿尔卑斯山的人们已经学会
High in the Alps, mountain people have learnt

293
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,619
用现代科技对抗雪崩带来的威胁
to control the threat of avalanches with modern technology.

294
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:42,809
但是在另一些山区中
But there are mountains

295
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,839
大自然的力量是无法抗拒的
where the forces of nature cannot be tamed.

296
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:56,059
喜马拉雅山是地球最高山
The Himalaya is the highest mountain range on Earth.

297
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,499
数百座世界高峰均聚于此地
The world's tallest hundred mountains are all here.

298
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:13,539
在这些高峰之中  居住着七千万人
And within these peaks live 70 million people,

299
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
较高的海拔
many at altitudes that

300
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,739
对人体造成了伤害
pose a threat to the human body.

301
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,859
在尼泊尔的多兰巴地区
In the Doramba region of Nepal,

302
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,189
人们正面临不可见的威胁
the residents face an insidious threat.

303
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,329
危险的高强度紫外线
Dangerously high levels of

304
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,669
穿过稀薄的高山空气
harmful UV rays pierce the thin mountain air

305
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,589
会灼伤人们的眼睛
and burn people's eyes.

306
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:49,769
在这里的巴劳村
And here in the village of Balau,

307
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:53,999
六十五岁的特缇妮付出了沉重的代价
65-year-old Teteeni has paid a heavy price.

308
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:56,709
她已经瞎了
She's blind.

309
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:04,609
三年前  看东西开始模糊

310
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:12,059
后来我就彻底瞎了

311
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:21,189
但是哭并没有用

312
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,499
特缇妮决定
Teteeni is determined not

313
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:28,099
不能让失明妨碍到她的生活
to let blindness interfere with her life,

314
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,379
但是一些简单的工作
but simple tasks,

315
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,639
比如打水  就得花更多的时间
such as fetching water, now take longer

316
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:34,189
并且还很危险
and can be treacherous.

317
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,209
她的失明是由白内障引起的
Her blindness is caused by cataracts,

318
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,769
眼球内的晶状体
a fogging of her lenses exacerbated

319
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,659
由于高海拔处强烈的阳光照射而变得混浊
by the intense mountain sun.

320
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:55,849
此处位于喜马拉雅山脉  地处偏僻
But isolated here in the Himalaya,

321
00:35:57,019 --> 00:36:00,049
特缇妮无法接受医学治疗
Teteeni has no access to medical treatment.

322
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:07,139
幸运的是  她心心念念的
Fortunately, an answer to

323
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,899
祷告即将得到回应
her prayers may be just around the corner.

324
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,429
加德满都[尼泊尔首都]的桑多克・鲁特医生
From Kathmandu, Dr. Sanduk Ruit

325
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,819
开创了一种新的眼部手术方法
has pioneered a method of eye surgery

326
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:20,639
并把这种技术带到喜马拉雅山偏远的村落
that he brings to the remote corners of the Himalaya.

327
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:30,049
他的流动诊所为成千上万人带来希望
His mobile clinic brings hope to thousands.

328
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:40,789
今天  特缇妮也要前往参与治疗
And today, Teteeni is setting off to join them.

329
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,969
在这山脉之间
She has arranged for the only transportation

330
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:52,569
她只能采用一种交通方式
available to her in these mountains.

331
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,559
一位朋友愿意背着她
A friend has offered to carry her

332
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:58,529
送她到十公里外的多兰巴诊所
ten kilometres to the Doramba clinic.

333
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,099
尽管鲁特医生的手术成功率很高
While Dr Ruit's success rate is high,

334
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:10,909
但特缇妮的眼睛仍可能
there is still a strong chance

335
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:14,389
因为失明太久而无法恢复
that Teteeni's eyes are too far gone to be saved.

336
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,079
他无法做出保证
He makes no promises.

337
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,699
多兰巴的学校
Doramba's schoolhouse

338
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,349
现在成为了临时手术室
is now an improvised operating theatre.

339
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,249
鲁特医生只用了半个小时
It takes Dr Ruit just half

340
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,109
就取出了特缇妮眼中混浊的晶状体
an hour to remove Teteeni's fogged lenses.

341
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,519
取而代之的是他自己制造的
He then replaces them

342
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:58,499
人工合成晶状体
with a synthetic lens he manufactures himself.

343
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:03,169
在西方国家
In the West,

344
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,429
这样一个手术要花费八千美元
this operation could cost 8,000 dollars.

345
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:10,349
不过有了慈善机构的资助
But, funded by charity,

346
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:14,039
鲁特医生不会收病人们一分钱
Dr Ruit doesn't charge his patients a single rupee.

347
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:22,349
手术结束后  特缇妮能做的只有等待
With surgery now complete, Teteeni can only wait.

348
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:39,749
二十四小时之后
Just 24 hours after her operation,

349
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,419
特缇妮和其他上百名病人一起
Teteeni joins hundreds of patients

350
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,829
等待着绷带被揭去的那一刻
waiting to have their bandages removed,

351
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,779
希望能重见天日
hopefully with her sight restored.

352
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:55,009
来看一下

353
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:57,959
对于特缇妮而言
For Teteeni,

354
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,299
这将是最关键的时刻
this is the moment of truth.

355
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,919
看着我

356
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:05,919
看这里

357
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:06,569
看得见吗

358
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,789
看得见  先生

359
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,289
告诉我你看见什么了

360
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,949
我看到你的鼻子还有嘴

361
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,659
我竖了几根手指

362
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,229
五根  先生

363
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,319
现在呢

364
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,599
两根

365
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,899
用你的手摸一下我鼻子

366
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,299
这里

367
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:25,209
是吗

368
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,309
再摸一下我的脸颊

369
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:32,349
轻轻的抚摸

370
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:36,299
-感觉怎么样  -非常好

371
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:46,049
这是三年来特缇妮第一次看清了世界
For the first time in three years, Teteeni can see.

372
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,609
愿上帝保佑鲁特医生

373
00:39:55,849 --> 00:40:04,219
之前我什么也看不见  现在可以了

374
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:17,129
我的问题终于解决了

375
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,999
我的内心充满光明

376
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,639
在喜马拉雅山脚
In the Himalayan foothills,

377
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,369
现代医学正在帮助
modern medicine is helping prolong

378
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:33,869
这里的人们延长他们的寿命
the lives of the people who live here.

379
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:44,099
然而  当你攀越海拔越来越高时
But, as you climb higher in these mountains,

380
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:47,479
如何处理人类的死亡就成了一个难题
it's how to deal with death that poses a problem.

381
00:40:57,579 --> 00:40:59,669
海拔四千多米之处
At over 4,000 metres,

382
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:03,599
多特拉是地球上最高部落之一
Dho Tarap is one of the highest communities on Earth.

383
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:13,289
这里的佛教徒几乎与世隔绝
Buddhists live here in almost complete isolation.

384
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,499
在这样的高海拔处  如果有人死亡
And when someone dies at this altitude,

385
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:24,719
处理尸体则是一个真正的挑战
dealing with the corpse is a real challenge.

386
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:32,459
昨天晚上  村里有人去世了
Last night, there was a death in the village.

387
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,199
七十岁的诺比拉刚刚过世
70-year-old Nombe-la passed away,

388
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:42,479
现在他的家人正在包裹尸体
and now his family are preparing his body

389
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:44,019
准备一场佛教葬礼
for a Buddhist funeral.

390
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:55,269
葬礼的主持人是神圣的朗杰喇嘛
The man in charge of this funeral is Holy Lama Namgyal.

391
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:05,389
诺比拉是一个很好的人

392
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,189
他工作勤奋...

393
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:14,459
教子有方

394
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:23,109
朗杰喇嘛必须马上举行葬礼
Lama Namgyal needs to hold the funeral soon

395
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,159
因为诺比拉的尸体
because Nombe-la's corpse

396
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,709
会引来食肉动物  还可能传播疾病
could attract predators and spread disease.

397
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:33,529
可是如果你生活在世界的屋脊
But when you live at the roof of the world,

398
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,869
选择就非常有限了
your options are limited.

399
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,949
佛教徒没有土葬
Buddhists don't bury their dead.

400
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,449
在这样的海拔下寸草不生
And at this altitude no trees grow,

401
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:49,669
因此也没有木料以供火葬
so there is no wood for a cremation.

402
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,679
唯一的办法是一种神圣的宗教仪式
The solution is a sacred ritual

403
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,769
比佛教本身更为悠久
older than Buddhism itself.

404
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:05,689
天葬
A sky burial.

405
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:12,649
天葬是这里的特殊习俗

406
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,059
为举行天葬
To conduct the sky burial ritual,

407
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,429
朗杰喇嘛需要专业人员的协助
Lama Namgyal needs the help of a specialist.

408
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:30,749
巴尔玛・福巴是送葬人
Bharmay Furba is the undertaker.

409
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,659
作为非佛教徒  他是唯一一名
As a non-Buddhist, he is the only one

410
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:40,169
可以执行这项艰难任务的人
who is allowed to carry out this most difficult task.

411
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:44,829
喇嘛没法做我的工作

412
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:53,869
我参与过很多次天葬

413
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,849
但仍需要喝些酒

414
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:17,469
送葬的队伍
The funeral procession

415
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,399
要行进一个半小时
heads an hour-and-a-half up into the mountains

416
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,949
才能到达山里举行天葬的神台
to a sacred ledge where sky burials have been performed

417
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,029
在那里  天葬已有一千多年的历史
for over 1,000 years.

418
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,639
他们将与这崇山之中
Here, they will rendezvous

419
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,939
最为高效的食腐动物会合
with the most efficient scavengers in these mountains.

420
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:40,459
秃鹫
Vultures.

421
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,039
数千年来
For millennia,

422
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,799
这里的佛教徒们就是依靠
Buddhists in these mountains

423
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:53,749
山里的秃鹫和髭兀鹰
have relied on the griffon vulture

424
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:57,309
来帮助他们处理尸体的
and the lammergeier to help them dispose of their dead.

425
00:45:02,149 --> 00:45:04,149
这些鸟类可以在疾病传播之前
These birds swiftly consume

426
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,929
迅速消灭掉尸体
a corpse before it can spread disease.

427
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,039
佛教徒们认为这样的行为非常神圣
Buddhists see this as a sacred act,

428
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:14,869
是赐予他们的恩惠
an offering that will sustain

429
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:16,909
让他们以另一种方式延续生命
the life of another being.

430
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:24,199
对他们而言
For them,

431
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,199
诺比拉的尸体现在就是一个空容器
Nombe-la's corpse is now an empty vessel.

432
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:32,549
他的灵魂已经去了另一国度
His soul has already migrated to another realm.

433
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:49,119
诺比拉的儿子们最后一次向父亲行礼
Nombe-la's sons pay their final respects to their father.

434
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:53,739
但他们不愿意
But they don't wish to

435
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:56,569
目睹接下来即将发生的事
be present for what is about to take place.

436
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:58,989
为了让秃鹫尽快
Because in order for the vultures

437
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,899
处理诺比拉的尸体
to consume Nombe-la's corpse quickly,

438
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,069
巴尔玛必须为它们提供方便
Bharmay must make it easier for them.

439
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:33,019
诺比拉的尸体现在已被消耗殆尽
Nombe-la's corpse is now gone

440
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:34,539
不会再传播疾病了
and cannot spread disease.

441
00:47:55,459 --> 00:48:00,349
山上所有的生命...

442
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:04,029
都是相互依存的

443
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:10,499
诺比拉的血肉为秃鹫提供了食物

444
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:20,089
这是善业

445
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:30,039
为了在高山间生活下去
To survive in the mountains,

446
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,729
你必须理解他们
you have to understand them.

447
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:42,619
山野间的生活环境十分残酷
Mountain habitats can be brutal

448
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,009
但是只要动用聪明才智和果敢的决断力
but if you use your ingenuity, determination,

449
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:50,599
随机应变并鼓起勇气
resourcefulness and courage

450
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:54,199
在世界的屋脊
it is possible to make a life here

451
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,009
同样可以打造人生
at the roof of the world.

452
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:11,079
人类星球
镜头背后的故事

453
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:16,629
《人类星球》山区摄制组
When the Human Planet mountains

454
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:19,269
在拍摄蒙古鹰猎人时
team filmed the Mongolian eagle hunters,

455
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:21,209
在雪原上寻找狐狸
their search for a fox

456
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,299
就好比是海底捞针
was like finding a needle in a haystack.

457
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,189
在广阔的蒙古平原上
Keeping up with the hunters

458
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:27,549
要跟上猎人的步伐
also proved near impossible

459
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,389
更是难上加难
in the vast Mongolian landscape.

460
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,629
蒙古  阿尔泰山脉
北纬48°58′01″  东经89°58′01″

461
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:38,149
摄制组要跟拍塞劳和他的儿子贝瑞克
The team are here to film Sailau and his son Berik

462
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,729
带着猎鹰巴拉潘出猎的情景
hunting with their eagle, Balapan.

463
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,719
摄影师基思・帕特里奇
Cameraman Keith Partridge

464
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,049
上一次见到贝瑞克和他的小鹰
last met Berik

465
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,929
还是在六月份
in June with his newborn chick.

466
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:51,829
现在已是十一月份  天气很冷
It's now November and bitterly cold

467
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,449
是打猎的理想时节
an ideal time for hunting,

468
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:55,779
这时  狼  狐狸和兔子
when wolves, foxes and rabbits

469
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,729
都换上了厚厚的皮毛
all have thick winter coats.

470
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:00,759
与野生动物不同
Unlike the wildlife,

471
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:04,529
老式俄罗斯卡车并不适合天寒地冻的环境
the old Russian trucks are not well adapted to the cold

472
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,649
所以司机们想出了一个聪明的办法
so the drivers devise a novel solution.

473
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:12,419
凯斯选择了另一种交通工具
Keith opts for a different ride.

474
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:13,879
事实上
The fact is

475
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:17,109
我从未在黑泽海滩[英国的游乐场所]骑过驴
that I haven't even ridden a donkey across Blackpool beach.

476
00:50:14,709 --> 00:50:18,269
基思・帕特里奇
摄影师

477
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,529
但现在却要骑马
And we've now got to go up there

478
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:20,979
前往山顶
on one of these.

479
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:22,529
我的马儿有名字吗
Does my horse have a name?

480
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:23,739
蒙古的马都没有名字

481
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:24,769
没有名字吗
They don't have names?

482
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:27,479
我们就根据它们的毛色叫名字

483
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,769
蒙古人光是形容马的毛色
The Mongolians have more than 300 words

484
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,549
阿吉・玛卡斯姆
剧务

485
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:33,499
就有三百多个词
just to describe the horse colours.

486
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,479
要让马走起来
You know that to make it go,

487
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:40,289
你得轻轻踢它的肚子  然后喊"驾"
you slightly kick and you should say, "Shu!"

488
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:41,959
好的  我们跟着阿吉好吗
OK, shall we follow Agii?

489
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,019
谢啦
Thank you.

490
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:44,549
就是这样
That's it.

491
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:54,089
终于  凯斯找到了窍门  顺利前行
Eventually, Keith finds the gears and off he goes.

492
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,729
三小时之后  卡车终于赶上来了
After three hours, the trucks catch up,

493
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:03,969
凯斯无比高兴能够离开马背了
and Keith's only too happy to leave his horse behind.

494
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:07,729
他觉得怎么样
What does he think?

495
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:11,919
骑得很好  马更棒一些

496
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,679
你这人除了鼻子之外都挺不错的

497
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:17,339
我的鼻子吗
Except my nose?

498
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:19,709
是太大了吗
Is it too big?

499
00:51:19,879 --> 00:51:21,069
没错

500
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:25,079
鼻子上会生冻疮的

501
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:27,789
你看  这样就不会冻了
There you go, no frostbite!

502
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:34,559
凯斯着手去测试小型鹰载摄像头
Keith heads off to test a small "Eagle-cam",

503
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,119
塞劳还特制了安全带
for which Sailau has made a harness.

504
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:42,709
别的摄像头可能图画效果更好一些
There are cameras that might give us a better picture quality

505
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:44,149
但是要比这个大得多
but they're much bigger

506
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:47,529
所以我们一直在可行性和图画质量
so we're playing this trade-off game all the time

507
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:50,049
之间权衡
between practicalities and quality.

508
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:51,929
不管怎样  我们看看这个效果如何
Anyway, we'll see how it goes.

509
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:57,469
看起来  塞劳的鹰
Sailau's eagle seems

510
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:00,629
背着那个摄像头飞得很欢
to fly quite happily with the eagle-cam on her back.

511
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:02,739
受第一次试验的鼓舞
Encouraged by the first test,

512
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,669
剧组换上了一个重一些且更清晰的摄像头
they use a heavier high-definition camera.

513
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,239
如果这个能成功就太棒了
This will be amazing if this works.

514
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,799
我们不知道它能不能承受得住这个重量
We don't even know if the bird will take the weight.

515
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:14,859
好比飞机超载了
We might have overloaded the plane, so to speak.

516
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:24,169
鹰翱翔的姿态很优美
The eagle flies beautifully.

517
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,379
凯斯和剧组人员回到基地
Keith and the team head back to base,

518
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,519
和导演尼克・布朗一起查看拍摄效果
joining director Nic Brown to view the results.

519
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:31,149
真是个紧张时刻
It's a very tense moment.

520
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:34,029
当地人也想看看俯视效果
The locals join in for a bird's-eye view.

521
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,609
他们从未从这种角度看过自己的鹰
They've never seen their eagles quite like this before.

522
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:40,119
-眼罩拿掉了  -没错
- The hood's off! - Hood's off.

523
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:42,779
开始了
Off we go.

524
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:47,559
-真小啊  上帝  真有意思  -看它的头
- How small, my God. Really wild! - Look at his head!

525
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,399
看它头部周围的雪堆
Look at that banking round with the head.

526
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,389
太有趣了  是吧
That's pretty wicked, isn't it?

527
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,189
第二天
The next day,

528
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:03,659
剧组跟着贝瑞克和
the crew follow Berik and

529
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:06,229
他的小鹰第一次出门狩猎
his young eagle on their first fox hunt.

530
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:08,909
狩猎者紧随驱逐者
The hunters shadow sweepers-

531
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,569
就是负责把狐狸赶到空旷地面的人们
men who flush the foxes out into the open.

532
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:16,419
剧组必须不停从一个山头移到另一个山头
The team must constantly move from peak to peak

533
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,009
为了给鹰一个最佳视野
to give the eagles the best chance of seeing a fox.

534
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:21,769
塞劳认为狐狸应该就藏在
Sailau thinks that the fox might be hiding

535
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:25,819
这些电话线后面的小山头里
over these small mounds just behind these telegraph lines.

536
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,019
他想去其中一个山头等等看
He would like to go to one of those hills and wait there.

537
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,929
也就是说我们得赶去那边
It seems to make sense that we've got to head there.

538
00:53:33,979 --> 00:53:36,089
你最好快点  伙计  他已经出发了
Well, you'd better be fast, mate, cos he's just gone.

539
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:36,959
他去那了
There he goes.

540
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:44,179
摄影组迅速打包  紧追猎人的步伐
After packing up quickly, the film crew race after the hunters.

541
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,359
正当凯斯开始摄影时
But as soon as Keith starts filming,

542
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:50,749
计划似乎又被打破了
the plans seem to change yet again.

543
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,979
塞劳现在又转移了  所以  我们也得转移
Sailau's now moved off again so, er, time to go.

544
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:56,419
我们才在这里待了两分钟
We've only been here for two minutes.

545
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,099
这就定下了今天的基调
This set the pattern of the day.

546
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:04,079
塞劳和贝瑞克从一个山头赶往另一个山头
As Sailau and Berik move from peak to peak,

547
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:05,949
剧组也一样  马不停蹄
so do the team, constantly

548
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:09,139
在高海拔处缺氧的状态下玩你追我赶游戏
playing catch-up in the thin, high-altitude air.

549
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,759
最后  精疲力尽之时  他们遇到一个新问题
Finally, near exhaustion, they face a new problem.

550
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:18,129
塞劳在哪儿
Where is Sailau?

551
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:21,389
他们呼叫导演
They call the director.

552
00:54:22,379 --> 00:54:24,709
尼克  尼克  这是凯斯  听得见吗  完毕
Nic, Nic. This is Keith, do you read? Over.

553
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:26,849
收到  你们进展如何
'Hi, yeah, how are you?'

554
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:28,489
今天已经跑了三个山头了
We're on our third mountain

555
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:31,059
但是任务还没有完成
range of the day so far and still no luck.

556
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:34,089
你们现在在哪座山  完毕
'Which mountain range are you on now? Over.'

557
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:38,479
我们要是知道就好了
If only we knew!

558
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:41,799
我们身后的山顶峰没有积雪
Behind us are the really big peaks with no snow on.

559
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:44,249
说实话  这里一片荒芜
The terrain here is pretty wild, actually,

560
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,629
如果要藏什么东西
and if anything's going to be lurking about,

561
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,869
我觉得就这附近最好了
I think I'd want to hide around here somewhere.

562
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:52,379
电线杆前面有东西  是狗吗
Something's in front of that telegraph pole. Is that a dog?

563
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,909
我们装上镜头看看
Let's get the lens on it.

564
00:54:59,459 --> 00:55:01,259
不是狼  是头牛
It's not a wolf, it's a cow!

565
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:05,029
祖宾・萨罗
录音师

566
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:04,589
我又没说是狼  我只说是个活物
I never said it was a wolf, I said it was moving.

567
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:05,619
那可没错
That is very true!

568
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,019
今天在爬第三个山头时
Do I get the sense that delirium

569
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:10,989
我怎么感觉有些发晕呢
is beginning to set in on the third mountain range of the day?

570
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:13,979
吃点儿巧克力棒吗
Would you like some chocolate bars?

571
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:19,509
阿吉  每当我们快晕过去的时候...
Agii, every day, just at the point where we are about to faint...

572
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:23,869
你咬咬看
You bust your teeth on them!

573
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,389
阿吉  我想说
I could ask you, Agii,

574
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:28,339
你就不能把它们放在稍稍暖一点的地方吗
if you could keep them somewhere slightly warmer!

575
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:36,649
他们又出发了
They set off yet again.

576
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:38,859
凯斯和剧组
Keith and the team are

577
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:41,269
开始对摄制狩猎情景绝望了
beginning to wonder if they'll ever film a hunt.

578
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,189
然后  好消息来了
But then, good news.

579
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,059
我们看见了一只狐狸
We have seen a fox.

580
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:49,409
沿着那个雪坡迅速逃窜
It scarpered really fast down that snowy slope.

581
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,499
他俩就在这附近
The guys are over there at the moment,

582
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:54,019
等着它停下来
trying to see where it's hunkered down.

583
00:55:54,929 --> 00:55:57,109
你能轻松地在雪中看到它们
Once they're out on the snow, you can see them pretty easily

584
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:59,299
因为那是个小黑点  拼命逃窜
cos it's a little black dot, scarpering like hell.

585
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,539
但是  你看看这地方
But, um, apart from that, you see this place.

586
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:03,679
非常广阔
It's utterly vast.

587
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:05,519
捕猎就像海底捞针一样困难
It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

588
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:10,109
突然  前面山谷传来了喊声  狩猎开始了
Suddenly, there's a call from the valley and the hunt is on.

589
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:14,089
请不要挡住镜头
Everybody clear the front of frame, please.

590
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:15,629
开始
Now!

591
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:37,089
这狐狸逃得真是快
I think the fox has made a hasty escape.

592
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,489
巴拉潘和剧组人员在第一次捕猎中
Both Balapan and the crew

593
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:41,979
都积攒了宝贵经验
have learned a lot on their first hunt.

594
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:48,289
剧组仍需拍摄一组成功狩猎的画面
Still...the team have yet to film a successful hunt.

595
00:56:49,249 --> 00:56:51,199
数天过去  一无所获
After several frustrating days,

596
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,219
压力越来越大
the pressure to deliver is intense.

597
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:00,439
快没时间了  但效果都不是很好
We're fast running out of time, it hasn't been looking very good.

598
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:03,929
正当剧组人员准备投降时
Just when the crew are resigned to failure,

599
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,079
他们听到了喊声
a call is heard.

600
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,999
儿子  那有只狐狸

601
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:13,529
凯斯深知这是他和巴拉潘成功的大好机会
Keith knows this is his and Balapan's big chance to succeed.

602
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:42,849
巴拉潘成功了
The bird got it!

603
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:48,279
当所有的呐喊声沉寂之后
When all those whoops go off,

604
00:57:48,389 --> 00:57:49,989
仅仅数秒之内  拍摄进度
things just go from nought to a million miles

605
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:52,609
从颗粒无收变成了一日千里
an hour in two or three seconds.

606
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:55,739
做这种事情的时候心跳会加速
Your heart races when you are doing this sort of stuff,

607
00:57:55,979 --> 00:57:58,469
你需要用一种积极的方式去回应
and you just have to respond in a kind of a positive way.

608
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,099
努力尝试
You know, just try and stay

609
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,009
全身心投入到工作中去
totally focused on what you are here to do.

610
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:05,599
当肾上腺素分泌时  很容易就分神了
When that adrenaline kicks in, it's easy to get distracted,

611
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,349
但你得想想
but you have to just think,

612
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,429
好了  现在是我上场的时候了
"Right, now is the time I've got to up my game,

613
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:14,229
沉下心来认真工作  完成拍摄任务
knuckle down and focus on getting the shot and making it work."

614
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:17,099
并且试图与你的工作伙伴
And also trying to build some form of relationship

615
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:19,199
建立良好的合作关系
with the people that you are working with as well.

616
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:21,219
只有这样他们才能信任我们
So that they trust us

617
00:58:21,449 --> 00:58:25,059
敞开双臂欢迎我们走进他们真实的生活
and welcome us into what's quite an intimate part of their lives.
