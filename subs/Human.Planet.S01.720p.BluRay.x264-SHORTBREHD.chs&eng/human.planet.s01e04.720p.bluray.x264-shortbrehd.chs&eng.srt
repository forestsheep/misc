1
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:07,618
只有一种生物
Only one creature

2
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:09,508
在地球上的每一处栖息地
has carved a life for itself

3
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,528
都能繁衍生存
in every habitat on Earth.

4
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:16,408
这种生物就是我们人类
That creature is us.

5
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,358
纵观世界
All over the world

6
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:21,228
今天我们仍在发挥聪明才智
we still use our ingenuity

7
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:26,418
在远离城市的蛮荒之地  顽强求生
to survive in the wild places, far from the city lights,

8
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,618
直面原始的大自然
face to face with raw nature.

9
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:53,718
丛林是最富生机  最错综复杂
The jungle is nature at its most vigorous, complex

10
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,408
和最富神秘感的存在
and mysterious.

11
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,288
它或许看上去广袤富饶
It may appear bountiful,

12
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,768
但是对人类来说
but for humans,

13
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:04,578
这里的环境却惊人地恶劣
this is a surprisingly hostile environment.

14
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,078
不过回溯历史
Though, through history,

15
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,558
人类的伟大文明曾发祥于此
great civilisations have arisen here,

16
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,348
却没能经受住时间的考验
none have stood the test of time.

17
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:37,128
丛林就是这样桀骜不驯
The jungle refuses to be tamed

18
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:40,888
惩罚着不守自然法则的人们
and it punishes those who don't live by its laws.

19
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,028
然而今时今日
Yet even today,

20
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:53,078
有些人却掌握了在原始世界生存的秘密
there are some who guard the secrets of surviving in this wild world.

21
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,308
本片将介绍那些以雨林为家的人们
These are the remarkable stories

22
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:59,138
非同寻常的传奇故事
of the people who call the rainforest home.

23
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:24,978
丛林

24
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:24,978
树林生存者

25
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:32,218
热带雨林仅仅覆盖了地球表面的2%
Tropical rainforests cover just 2% of the planet's surface,

26
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:37,128
但地球上一半的物种皆栖息于此
but they're home to half of all species on Earth.

27
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:41,288
可问题是
The problem is,

28
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:44,138
很多动物生活在树梢之上
much of this life is in the tree-tops,

29
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,658
让我们难以触及
a world way out of our reach.

30
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:58,158
要想从地面采获树上的丰富资源
Exploiting the canopy's riches

31
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,968
是极富挑战的
from the forest floor is so challenging,

32
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,708
每天要获得充足的食物都来之不易
getting enough protein is a daily struggle.

33
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,268
巴西的马蒂人捕猎本领高超
The Matis of Brazil are highly skilled hunters

34
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:22,178
但在过去的几周内
but for the past week

35
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,968
他们猎来的食物只是勉强够分
there's been barely enough meat to go round.

36
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:32,438
本宁饿着肚子  所以他下决心
Benin is hungry and he's determined

37
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:34,808
今天的狩猎必须收获更多
today's hunt will be more successful.

38
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,678
他把树蛙的毒素
Administering tree-frog toxin

39
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:47,618
注入血流当中  促使他的身体
into his bloodstream purges his body,

40
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,588
为狩猎做好准备
preparing it for action.

41
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,838
毒素能使我们更加强壮和迅速

42
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,838
...这样我们就能追上逃跑的动物了

43
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:10,848
马蒂人还在眼睛里滴入一种有毒的树汁
The Matis also drop a noxious plant juice into their eyes

44
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,028
来刺激自己的意识
to sharpen their senses

45
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:15,208
把注意力集中在狩猎上
and focus their minds on the hunt.

46
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,018
小鸟飞得快...

47
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:26,008
野鸡跑得快...

48
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,978
野鹿跑得快

49
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,628
本宁和其他人借此召唤动物的精髓附身
Benin and the others summon the power of the animal spirits.

50
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,368
从地面捕捉树上的动物
Hunting canopy animals from the ground

51
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,768
需要借助强大的火力
requires formidable fire power,

52
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,328
一根4米长的吹管
a four-metre long blowpipe,

53
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:58,618
经过了几千年的精密加工和打磨
precision-made to a design honed over thousands of years.

54
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:04,068
我们继承了族人的狩猎技术...

55
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,608
这些来自我们的先辈们...

56
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:12,518
我们花上好些年来掌握

57
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:20,648
要在茂密的植被中寻找猎物是很艰难的
Spotting animals in the dense vegetation is so hard,

58
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:24,368
马蒂人只能依靠听觉来确定猎物的位置
the Matis rely on hearing to locate prey

59
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:36,038
用模仿来引诱它们进入狩猎范围
and use mimicry to lure them into range.

60
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:40,348
他们能模仿森林里
They can imitate all ten

61
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:43,258
全部数十种猴子的叫声
species of monkey found in these forests.

62
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,518
一只吼猴在应和
A howler monkey responds.

63
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,288
在30米高的地方
30 metres up,

64
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:08,418
猴子们在一颗无花果树上进食
monkeys are feeding in a fig tree.

65
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,498
用食人鱼的牙齿打磨飞镖
Scoring the darts with piranha teeth

66
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:24,318
能确保有毒的箭头刺穿猎物的身体
ensures the poisoned tip breaks off in the victim's body.

67
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:32,598
与猎枪不同  吹火管几乎无声
Unlike guns, blowpipes are near silent

68
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,458
发射时不会惊动到猴子
and can be fired without spooking the monkeys.

69
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,338
本宁射中第一枪
Benin makes the first hit,

70
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:43,018
现在猴子们仓皇而逃
and now the monkeys scatter.

71
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:49,688
一旦射中  箭毒便发挥作用
Once shot, the monkeys must be tracked

72
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:52,428
猴子就一定能被追踪到
as the curare-vine poison takes effect.

73
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,118
这只猴子已经很虚弱了
This monkey's already weak,

74
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,918
它仍躲藏着  但必然被驱赶出来
but it's hiding, and must be flushed out.

75
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,358
他们又射了一枪
They shoot again.

76
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,798
它被一根树藤缠住了
It's stuck in a vine now,

77
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,148
他们只有爬上去取它下来
and there is no choice but to go and get it.

78
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:30,228
第一只收入囊中  但这只是开始
One down, but it's just the beginning.

79
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,888
作为最敏捷的猎手之一
As one of the swiftest hunters,

80
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:45,238
抓获逃脱的猴子是本宁的职责
it's Benin's job to pick off any escaping monkeys.

81
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,458
他射向了另一只  但没射中
He shoots another, but misses.

82
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,448
本宁又发了一枪
Benin fires again,

83
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,558
这一次命中目标
this time on target.

84
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:19,088
这只猴子终于停了下来
The monkey finally stops

85
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,168
本宁瞄准最后一只
and Benin takes aim one last time.

86
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,478
8只猴子
Eight monkeys.

87
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,158
今天是满载而归的一天
It's been a good day.

88
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,058
但其实他们经常空手而归
But all too often they return empty-handed.

89
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:44,968
这让我非常高兴...

90
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:49,518
能把肉食带回去给家人

91
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:54,608
高空捕猎是非常困难的
Hunting in the canopy is so difficult,

92
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:58,398
因此大部分的食物  必须在地面寻求
people must find most of their food closer to the ground.

93
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,938
可单单靠地面上的猎物谋生
But scratching a living on the forest floor

94
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,608
也不会容易到哪去
is hardly any easier.

95
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:11,718
这个神秘的世界  本就错综繁复
The complex nature of this mysterious world

96
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,848
难以驾驭
is so hard to master,

97
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,378
这一点  必须尽早明晰
the lessons have to start early.

98
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:27,648
奥兰多  来自委内瑞拉皮亚拉奥部落
Orlando's from the Piaroa tribe of Venezuela.

99
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:30,328
他和其他的孩子一样
He's like any other kid,

100
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:32,068
在丛林里的朴素生活
only life in the jungle

101
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,798
已经迫使他学会自谋生计
has already forced him to fend for himself.

102
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:39,308
如果家里没有食物了...

103
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:44,358
我就得去打猎

104
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,518
但是这样的童年冒险经历
But this childhood adventure

105
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:51,638
带他们进入到丛林深处
takes them deep into the jungle underworld.

106
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:02,688
由于只有2%的阳光能够到达地表
As only 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor,

107
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,148
因此只有极少数的植物生长与此
surprisingly few plants grow

108
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,648
这也意味着  极少的动物在此活动
and this means few animals.

109
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:15,498
这里的食物甚至比沙漠地区还要少
There's less protein here than in the desert

110
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:19,248
并且很多还是有毒的
and much that is here is poisonous.

111
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,358
这里什么也没有

112
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:31,528
区分有毒食物是一项必需的生活技能
Distinguishing dinner from danger is an essential life skill.

113
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:37,208
这里看起来不错

114
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:41,178
几乎没有什么生物
Few creatures have a more

115
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:44,368
比他们寻找的  更令人望而生畏
sinister reputation than the one they seek.

116
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,448
这种巨大的狼蛛
The goliath tarantula,

117
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,038
和餐盘一样大
the size of a dinner plate,

118
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:11,778
是世界上最大的蜘蛛
the largest spider in the world.

119
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:21,548
这样的晚餐  简直让人倒胃口
It's hard to imagine a less appetising meal,

120
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,928
但挑食的人  是无法在丛林里存活的
but picky eaters don't last long in the jungle.

121
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,058
把树叶给我

122
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,758
何况  奥兰多说它们很美味
Besides, Orlando says they're delicious,

123
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:37,278
捕捉这样危险的动物  也是分区域的
and handling dangerous animals comes with the territory.

124
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,048
大概从五岁起
From about five years old,

125
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:49,358
皮亚拉奥部落的孩子就知道该去哪捉蜘蛛
Piaroa children know exactly where to hunt for spiders

126
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:54,768
而且几个小时内就能抓到足够一餐的数量
and in a couple of hours can catch enough for a decent meal.

127
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:08,208
但是他们必须小心蜘蛛巨大的毒牙
But they have to be careful of both the huge fangs

128
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,548
和它们向侵犯者喷发的体毛
and of the hairs they kick towards any attacker.

129
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:17,788
小心点  不然这些毛会刺到我们

130
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,548
如果这些毛接触到肌肤或者被吸入体内
If they contact the skin or are inhaled,

131
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:22,328
会令人痛苦难忍
they cause a nasty reaction.

132
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,958
我被刺到了

133
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,318
抓住它

134
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:31,498
奥兰多不幸被刺
Orlando's come off worst.

135
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,758
我痒极了

136
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,228
但是在这个丛林里长大
But growing up in the jungle,

137
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,048
他早就适应了这种微小的不适
he's used to a little discomfort.

138
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,928
我们把它吃了然后就睡觉去

139
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:49,888
狼蛛最适合烤着吃  尝起来像棉花糖
Tarantulas are best served toasted, like marshmallows.

140
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:50,888
棉花糖是一种生长在非洲的植物

141
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,508
所有的毛发必须烤至脱落
All the hairs must be singed off

142
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,498
这样就不会卡在喉咙里
so they don't catch in the throat.

143
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,938
随着关节部位被渐渐烤干
And when they start squeaking,

144
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,488
它们会发出甑南焐
which is just air escaping from the joints,

145
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,028
他们快弄好了
they're almost done.

146
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:07,978
烤蜘蛛总是发出这样的声音

147
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,168
我的已经好了

148
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,478
狼蛛吃起来有点像螃蟹
Tarantulas taste a bit like crab

149
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,868
而且  加上一点佐料  将会十分美味
and, with a little seasoning, they go down a treat.

150
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:26,568
罗索娜  把辣酱递给我

151
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,568
奥兰多和他的朋友们能够生存下来
Orlando's and his friends' survival

152
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:38,728
在于他们能把握住森林中每一次机会
depends upon embracing every opportunity in the forest.

153
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,558
居住在丛林里的人们十分依赖周边的环境
Jungle people rely so heavily on their surroundings,

154
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:58,128
他们已经融入成为森林的一部分
they become a natural part of the forest

155
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,188
并于大自然建立了非同寻常的联系
and form extraordinary bonds with nature.

156
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,138
很少会有人比亚马逊东部的阿毋瓜嘉人
Very few people live more intimately with animals

157
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:19,208
与动物更亲密
than the Awa Guaja of the eastern Amazon.

158
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:26,688
他们饲养了一系列的来自森林的生物
Nurturing a wide range of creatures from the forest,

159
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:30,078
痴迷地喂养宠物
the Awa are obsessive pet keepers.

160
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:40,728
有一些动物比另外一些更受珍惜
And there are some animals they cherish above any others.

161
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:48,848
与马蒂人一样  猎猴对阿毋人的生存极为重要
Like the Matis, hunting monkeys is vital to the Awa's survival,

162
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,328
这为他们提供将近一半的食物
providing nearly half their protein.

163
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:57,448
但是  这种关系远不止是提供食物
But this relationship provides far more than food.

164
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:03,728
恩维不仅仅吃猴子
Emwi not only eats monkeys,

165
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,028
她深爱着它们
she loves them.

166
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,518
我喜欢养猴子

167
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,218
如果杀死一只母猴...

168
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,128
我会把它的孩子养作宠物

169
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,108
宠物并不好吃

170
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:27,558
我们只吃从森林打回来的猴子

171
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,168
几乎所有的阿毋家庭
Almost all Awa families

172
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:35,268
都会饲养一些猴子作为宠物
keep a number of monkey pets.

173
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,508
在村落里有8个不同的种类
There are eight different species in the village.

174
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:45,388
阿毋人对猴子表现出特别的温柔
The Awa show extraordinary tenderness for the little monkeys,

175
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,888
他们更相信它们是人类的一员
believing they're more human than animal.

176
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:55,188
恩维是个尽职的母亲
Emwi is a devoted mother,

177
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,708
不论是对她的孩子还是猴子
both to her children and her monkeys.

178
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,628
这就像用母乳喂养一个小孩

179
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:10,368
它不会伤害你  因为它已经被驯服了

180
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,928
对恩维和其他的阿毋人来说
For Emwi and the other Awa,

181
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:17,498
用母乳喂养猴子
breastfeeding monkeys

182
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,418
只是帮助有需要的孤儿的
is simply a natural way

183
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,308
一种天然的方式
to help an orphan in need.

184
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,208
如果我不哺育它...

185
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,638
它就会死的

186
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,588
对一种经常捕杀的动物
Caring so intimately for an animal

187
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,768
给予如此细微的照顾
they regularly kill

188
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,688
可能听起来自相矛盾
may appear contradictory,

189
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:41,528
但是阿毋人相信  他们从雨林里索取什么
but the Awa believe for everything they take from the forest,

190
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,488
就得归还什么
they have to give back.

191
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,678
当我们的生活与动植物
When our lives are so deeply entwined

192
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,848
如此紧密地纠缠在一起
with animals and plants,

193
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:01,338
它们就必然成为伟大灵感的来源
they inevitably become a great source of inspiration.

194
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:07,128
效仿自然最为壮观的文化案例
Perhaps the most spectacular case of culture imitating nature

195
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:10,078
也许就发生在巴布亚新几内亚
is found amongst the people of Papua New Guinea.

196
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:25,408
丛林深处
Deep in the forest,

197
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,988
一只极品雄性天堂鸟
a male superb bird of paradise

198
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:31,118
向一只土土的雌鸟展示自己华丽的羽毛
struts his stuff for a rather drab female

199
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,878
但她却不是唯一的观众
but she isn't the only one watching.

200
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:46,378
葛林是天堂鸟捕手
Geling is a bird of paradise hunter,

201
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:49,728
他想要的是价值极高的羽毛
and it's the highly prized feathers he's after.

202
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:15,388
多美的羽毛啊

203
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,248
真是一只极品鸟

204
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:23,018
这些令人垂涎的羽毛被一代代传递下去
These coveted plumes are passed down through generations

205
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,648
但是偶尔损坏的需要用新的替代
but occasionally damaged ones need replacing.

206
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,968
然而  天堂鸟极其难捕获
Birds of paradise are so hard to hunt, however,

207
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,018
因此葛林需要援手
that Geling's enlisted help.

208
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:43,358
佩卡相中的是公主长尾风鸟的长尾羽
Peke is after the long tail feathers of the Princess Astrapia,

209
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,368
他用水果引诱它们现身
and he's using fruit to lure them in.

210
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:16,878
明天可是葛林的大日子
Tomorrow is a big day for Geling.

211
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,428
他的族人将在晒晒大会上表演
His clan will be performing at a Sing Sing,

212
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,708
他的声望及全村荣誉的评判标准
where his reputation and the honour of his village

213
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,818
都在于他羽毛收藏的优劣
will be judged on the quality of his feather collection.

214
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:37,018
晒晒大会比的就是
Sing Sing events are all about competing

215
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:39,328
谁穿着最佳
to see who's the best-dressed,

216
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,878
葛林知道漂亮的羽毛必不可少
and Geling knows not a plume can be out of place.

217
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:49,938
羽毛让人引人注目...

218
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:54,238
这次我一定是最夺目的

219
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:57,688
在鸟类和人类当中
In both birds and humans,

220
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:01,238
最吸引人眼球的那位  得到最多的关注
it's the most eye-catching who gets the most attention,

221
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,798
尽管葛林可能高估了他的战利品
though Geling might be overstating his conquests.

222
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,098
晒晒大会上会有六七个娘儿们追着我

223
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:13,858
我都无从选择...

224
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,328
是一次全上...

225
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:21,158
还是每晚上一个轮一周

226
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,248
海根山区的晒晒大会
The Mount Hagen Sing Sing

227
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:39,528
是世界上最大的丛林主题的盛装派对
is the world's largest jungle-themed fancy-dress party.

228
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:45,648
有几百个部落参加
Attended by hundreds of tribes,

229
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:48,998
是新几内亚全国最大的盛事之一
it's one of New Guinea's biggest national events.

230
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,898
穿梭人流之中
Amidst the mayhem,

231
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:00,188
葛林给自己的服装添上最后的点睛之笔
Geling's putting the finishing touches to his outfit.

232
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,938
戴着我的头饰...

233
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,098
让我整个人感觉自豪又富有

234
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:10,128
在新几内亚  男性的虚荣是可炫耀的
In New Guinea, male vanity is something to flaunt.

235
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,708
尽管每个部落都有自身的风格
Though each clan has its own style,

236
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:24,448
但几乎所有人都加入了
almost all wear bird of

237
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,138
天堂鸟羽毛  为头冠增光添彩
paradise feathers as their crowning glory.

238
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:37,228
他们的着装  甚至求爱舞蹈
In their looks, and even their courtship dances,

239
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,978
人类和鸟类的一致特征一目了然
the parallels between man and animal are unmistakable.

240
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,328
他们是戴着羽毛的鸟类
They're birds of a feather.

241
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,748
两者都用珍贵的羽翼来展示健康和美丽
Both use these precious plumes to display fitness and beauty.

242
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:02,328
站上中央舞台  是葛林炫耀的时候了
Taking centre stage, it's Geling's turn to show off.

243
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,288
要花好多年头才能攒下这么多羽毛呢...

244
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:14,038
会被认为是部落里有身份的人

245
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:15,728
这种和天堂鸟之间密切的联系
This deep connection with

246
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:20,578
始于4万年前
birds of paradise began 40,000 years ago

247
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:24,088
却没有一点式微的迹象
and it shows few signs of fading.

248
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,888
葛林有点兴奋
Geling's getting on a bit,

249
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,438
而他的仰慕者们
and his female admirers

250
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,668
并不像过去的那么多
aren't quite as plentiful as they used to be,

251
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,788
但他还是一心展示他的羽毛
but he's not going to let that ruffle his feathers.

252
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,848
热带雨林的多样性特质
The diverse nature of the rainforest

253
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:50,768
在方方面面都影响着居住其中的人们
influences the people who live here in endless ways

254
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:54,228
并且经常带来令人赞叹的结果
and it often leads to breathtaking results.

255
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:01,928
对于非洲刚果盆地的巴亚卡部落来说
For the Bayaka tribe of Africa's Congo basin,

256
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:05,308
丛林的声音对他们的启发最大
it's the sounds of the jungle that most inspire them.

257
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,508
要么把河流当成架子鼓
Whether using a river as a drum kit,

258
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:44,718
要么配合动物的鸣叫合唱工作小曲儿
or incorporating animal calls into their work songs,

259
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,948
巴亚卡人把音乐
the Bayaka consider music

260
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:53,958
当作雨林最大的赐予
to be their greatest gift from the forest.

261
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,698
但是这里还有一种东西
But there's something else

262
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,948
让巴亚卡人趋之若鹜
found here the Bayaka prize just as highly.

263
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:15,138
其价值之高以至于他们愿意用生命去交换
So highly they're prepared to risk their lives for it.

264
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:22,558
特特和蒙公杰去狩猎了
Tete and Mongonje are on the hunt,

265
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:25,358
但他们并不是奔着肉食去的
but it's not meat they're after.

266
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:31,268
蒙公杰  看啊  那里有个蜂窝

267
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:34,118
蜜蜂们都冲这边来了  在那根树枝上

268
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,678
就在那根树枝上

269
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:40,388
-可是实在太高了
-但我老婆好久没吃过蜂蜜了

270
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:42,858
她生气了吗

271
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,008
是啊  火大得很

272
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,918
蜂蜜对巴亚卡人来说就是液体黄金
Honey is liquid gold to the Bayaka,

273
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:51,128
他们不畏高度去采集蜂蜜
and they go to extraordinary lengths to gather it.

274
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,348
凭借一根特制的藤条
Using a special vine,

275
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:57,258
特特用它作为辅助
Tete makes a harness to help him

276
00:24:57,258 --> 00:25:00,238
爬上这棵高达40米的树
get to grips with this 40-metre tree.

277
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:13,198
像他这样爬树需要技巧  力量和耐力
Climbing like this requires skill, strength and stamina,

278
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:15,498
特别是在热带炎热的天气下
especially in the tropical heat.

279
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,898
特特爬树时
While Tete climbs,

280
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,478
蒙公杰燃起了一大堆树叶
Mongonje prepares a bundle of smoking leaves

281
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:24,748
来安抚蜜蜂们的不安
to help pacify the bees.

282
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:37,008
一个小时过去了  特特已经爬到很高了
An hour's passed and Tete's making impressive progress.

283
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:02,078
但是他还有一大段距离
But he's still got a way to go.

284
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:14,068
发现蜂蜜的消息传得很快
News that honey's been found has spread quickly,

285
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:17,148
特特的妻儿都前来围观
and Tete's wife and kids come to watch.

286
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,958
爬树的时候...

287
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:27,098
必须把脑子里的害怕全部清空

288
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:32,928
特特终于到达了树冠
Tete's finally made it to the crown of the tree

289
00:26:32,928 --> 00:26:34,488
但是为了更前一步
but to go any further

290
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:37,308
他必须离开藤条的保护
he'll have to leave the security of his vine.

291
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:48,578
你越害怕  越是容易掉下去

292
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:55,738
很多朋友们都是这样摔死的

293
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:04,038
特特清楚地知道采集蜂蜜的危险
Tete's fully aware how dangerous honey gathering is,

294
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:08,008
但是巴亚卡人认为无勇气  不男人
but the Bayaka believe it's bravery that makes the man,

295
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,848
雨林里能找的甜食如此稀少
and sugar is so scarce in these forests

296
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:16,248
蜂蜜已是特特能为家里提供的最好的营养品
that honey is the best nutrition Tete can provide for his family.

297
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,528
我家特特最棒了

298
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:31,178
孩子们一点也不担心他

299
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,778
只有自豪

300
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,458
他们会说  瞧老爸多棒

301
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:56,298
远在40米的高空  完全没有保护措施
40 metres up, and unattached,

302
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,568
特特每一步都要很谨慎
Tete can't put a foot wrong.

303
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:02,918
现在蜜蜂们开始袭击他了
And now the bees are beginning to attack.

304
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:10,158
他已经到达了蜂窝
He's made it to the hive,

305
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:16,008
但他必须赶在蜜蜂大批袭来之前取到蜂蜜
but he's got to get at the honey before being overcome by bees.

306
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:27,408
烟雾有点效果  但是特特还是被蛰了
The smoke helps, but Tete's still being stung.

307
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:40,448
终于  特特采到了珍贵的蜂蜜
Finally, Tete strikes gold.

308
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,048
收获真不错...

309
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:49,618
好多蜂蜜呢

310
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:58,668
特特的家人收到了第一篮蜂蜜
The first basket goes down to Tete's family

311
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,728
几千只愤怒的蜜蜂们
and even thousands of angry bees

312
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:05,368
也影响不了这顿美味
can't stop the feast.

313
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,898
蜂蜜可好吃了

314
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,698
...非常好吃

315
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:22,128
我老公心肠很好

316
00:29:24,168 --> 00:29:28,418
他经常给我采蜂蜜吃

317
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:33,498
特特并不着急下树  品尝着自己的胜利果实
Tete takes time to savour his success.

318
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:37,048
他做的够多了  让老婆孩子甜了嘴
He's done enough to keep his wife sweet, treat his children

319
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:39,568
并且还赢得了族人的尊敬
and earn respect from his tribe.

320
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,598
对雨林人民来说
For forest people,

321
00:29:57,598 --> 00:30:00,728
简单的东西也有着巨大的价值
simple things can hold extraordinary value,

322
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:03,748
但是正是这些树木本身
but it's the trees themselves

323
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:06,688
在世界范围内需求巨大
that are most in demand around the world.

324
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,808
伐木是全世界雨林地区
Logging is one of the greatest threats

325
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:22,998
面临的最大威胁之一
facing the world's rainforests.

326
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:25,228
但也有少数地区
Yet there are a few places

327
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:27,978
伐木带来的破坏力并不那么大
where its effects are far less destructive.

328
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:36,658
印度和缅甸交界处的雨林木材
The jungles bordering India and Burma are harvested

329
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:39,888
就是用最环保的方式开采的
using one of the most forest-friendly methods of all.

330
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,628
它借助了雨林中最强大生物的
And it involves harnessing the raw power

331
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,058
原生态力量
of the mightiest creature in the jungle.

332
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:56,958
这是兰普萨
This is Ramprasad -

333
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,568
一头重达5吨半的雄性亚洲象
five-and-a-half tonnes of bull Asian elephant.

334
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:05,008
这是苏米尔  他的主人
And this is Sumir, his mahout.

335
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:08,098
干得不错哟  兰普萨

336
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,598
天黑之前  他们需要将2吨重的原木
Before nightfall, they have to drag a two-tonne log

337
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,418
搬出林子外三公里的地方
three kilometres out of the forest.

338
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,108
兰普萨是队伍里最强大的一头象
Ramprasad is the mightiest elephant in the camp,

339
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,698
但这任务依旧是
but it's still a mammoth test

340
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:24,088
对蛮力和彼此交流的巨大考验
of brute strength and communication.

341
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:32,688
苏米尔通过100多种口令指挥兰普萨
Sumir steers Ramprasad with over 100 different commands.

342
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:36,678
右边点  再右点  行了

343
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:43,798
他可以听得懂北印度语  阿萨姆语
He can be operated in Hindi, Assamese

344
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,488
甚至还懂一点点英语
and he even understands a little English.

345
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,078
苏米尔也是驾驭大象的老手了
And Sumir's pretty fluent in elephant too.

346
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,338
我能通过他的肢体语言...

347
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,538
了解他的情绪

348
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:03,328
你这头老象  别跟孩子一样

349
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:10,518
不可思议的强壮  加上令人吃惊的灵活性
Unbelievably strong and surprisingly nimble,

350
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:12,278
在这种复杂的地形区
elephants are far superior

351
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,258
大象是搬运木材的最佳选择
to logging machines in this tangled terrain.

352
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:19,548
更重要的是
Most importantly,

353
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:22,248
没有必要为了运送几棵选好的木材
the forest doesn't have to be completely cleared

354
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:25,328
就清出一大片森林开道
just to access a few selected trees.

355
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:34,248
要是把大机器开进来...

356
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:38,788
会完全毁了这片林子

357
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,288
直走

358
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:50,578
完全没有必要更换昂贵的零件
There's no need for expensive spare parts,

359
00:32:51,978 --> 00:32:54,888
大象们百分百低碳环保
and elephants run on 100% green fuel.

360
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:01,078
但是  和机器不一样的是
But, unlike a machine,

361
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,948
兰普萨有自己的思想
Ramprasad has a mind of his own

362
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,008
他需要受到敬重
and must be treated with respect.

363
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:10,768
大象们可是强大得很呐

364
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,158
很多人因此丧命...

365
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,298
正是因为不理解他们的象

366
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:22,788
在让大象工作前  将它们驯化至关重要
It's essential to break elephants in before they're put to work,

367
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,008
但他们内心仍然狂野
but they're still wild at heart,

368
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:29,568
而掌控好这样的原始动物  讲究的是
and keeping control of such raw might is a fine balancing act

369
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:31,458
命令它们与怜惜它们的微妙平衡
of command and compassion.

370
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:50,868
苏米尔和兰菩萨及时到达了采集地
Sumir and Ramprasad make it to the collection site in good time

371
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:52,568
还帮助卡车装卸木头
and help load the trucks.

372
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,928
将原木运输到锯木厂
Transporting logs to the sawmill

373
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:02,448
是全过程唯一要用到机械的地方
is the only mechanised part of the entire process.

374
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,338
但他们还没法走出森林
But they're not out of the woods yet.

375
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:22,218
又一次  在这丛林环境下
Once again, under jungle conditions,

376
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:25,058
大象的作用超过了机动车
elephants out-perform engines.

377
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:37,358
工作完成  该好好洗个澡
Job done, time for a well-earned wash.

378
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:47,208
东印度和缅甸的丛林
The jungles of East India and Burma

379
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,888
形成了亚洲最大的雨林地带
form the largest area of rainforest left in Asia

380
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,828
为最后一小群健康的亚洲象
and provide sanctuary for the last healthy population

381
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,308
提供了庇护所
of Asian elephants.

382
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:04,928
兰菩萨和其他大象已经失去了自由
Ramprasad and these other elephants have lost their freedom,

383
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:09,048
但这种伐木方式保全了它们物种的未来
but this way of logging helps secure the future of their species

384
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,168
以及它们的家园
and their home.

385
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:17,198
正是靠这种与自然合作的关系
It's through partnerships with nature

386
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,758
人们才能在不破坏丛林的前提下
that people manage to live within the jungle

387
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,778
生存下去
without destroying it.

388
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:28,848
但是在大多数热带雨林区
But in most areas of tropical rainforest,

389
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:31,168
画面并不这样和谐
the picture is not so harmonious.

390
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:43,708
在短短50年里
In just 50 years,

391
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,098
地球上一半的热带雨林已被砍伐殆尽
half the planet's tropical forest has been cleared.

392
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:55,218
每天有多达一百个雨林物种走向灭亡
As many as 100 rainforest species go extinct every day,

393
00:35:57,048 --> 00:36:00,018
许多还未被人类发现
often before they've even been discovered.

394
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,248
我们失去的不只是动植物
And it's not just animals and plants.

395
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,358
那些我们一无所知的人类文明
We're also losing human cultures

396
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:14,988
也包括在内
that we know almost nothing about.

397
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:22,128
即便是在21世纪
Even in the 21st century,

398
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:23,708
仍有一些人
there are still people who

399
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,738
隔绝于其他人类而独立存在着
exist in isolation from the rest of humanity,

400
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:30,668
并且基本全都住在丛林里
and virtually all live in jungles.

401
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:37,158
这些广阔的  未经勘探的森林
These vast, unexplored forests

402
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:39,308
是地球上唯一一个能让整个部族
are the only places left on Earth

403
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:42,578
安居并不被发现的地方
where entire communities can live undetected.

404
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:49,008
巴西是70多个原始部落的聚集地
Brazil is thought to be home to around 70 isolated tribes,

405
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:52,128
占到世界总数的三分之二
around two-thirds of the world total.

406
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,968
琼斯・卡洛斯・梅尔雷斯在FUNAI工作
Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI,

407
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:01,888
一所专门保护巴西土著居民的政府机关
a government agency that protects Brazil's indigenous people.

408
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:07,028
今天  他希望能遇上某个原始部落
Today, he's hoping to encounter one of these uncontacted tribes.

409
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,878
你现在必须转身

410
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,578
快掉头

411
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:15,118
他要赶在别人之前找到他们
He needs to get to them before others do.

412
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:20,528
我们的职责是监管好这片区域...

413
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:27,298
确保没人来打搅他们...

414
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:32,568
让他们能过着安宁的生活

415
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,808
伐木业和采矿业正蚕食着这些森林
Logging and mining are encroaching on these forests

416
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,758
还有人极力否认
and there are some who want to deny

417
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,668
有原始部落居住在这
that uncontacted tribes live here at all.

418
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:50,108
这些部落可能会被铲平...

419
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:53,568
就跟拍死一只蚊子一样轻而易举...

420
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:57,308
没人会注意到

421
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:02,878
可以了  差不多到了

422
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,368
梅尔雷斯需要证据
Meirelles needs evidence.

423
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,588
保护这些人民的斗争
The fight to protect these people

424
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:12,658
需要证明他们的存在  并公之于众
depends upon proving and publicising their existence.

425
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,818
一张他们的照片...

426
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:18,118
就能胜过千言万语

427
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:23,558
眼见为实

428
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:31,358
这绝对是第一个
This is the very first

429
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,698
对原始部落的航拍镜头
aerial footage of an uncontacted community.

430
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:44,688
这些人生活在21世纪...

431
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:49,578
简直太不可思议了

432
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:55,838
他们的生活方式以及
Very little is known about their way of life

433
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,498
他们的语言我们都知之甚少
or even their language,

434
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:01,388
而梅尔雷斯宁愿他们永远保持原状
and Meirelles would rather it stays that way.

435
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:09,138
他为保护原始部落不受外界干扰
He's dedicated 40 years to protecting

436
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,688
贡献了自己四十年的光阴
isolated tribes from the outside world,

437
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:15,478
但这可不像由他们自生自灭那么简单
but this isn't as simple as just leaving them alone.

438
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:22,688
他们的未来由不得自己

439
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:26,248
而是取决于我们  我们的企图

440
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:31,138
如果非法矿工和伐木工遇到了这些人...

441
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,328
他们不会对他们拍照...

442
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:36,008
而是会扣动扳机

443
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:39,368
使用稳定的变焦镜头
Using a stabilised zoom lens,

444
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:42,408
就可以在一公里外进行拍摄
it was possible to film from a kilometre away,

445
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:44,438
来减小对他们的打扰
minimising disturbance.

446
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:48,448
梅尔雷斯认为  越多人知道
Meirelles believes the more people are aware

447
00:39:48,448 --> 00:39:50,158
这些部落的存在
these tribes are here,

448
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:53,568
保护他们生存方式的斗争  就越有效
the more effective the fight to preserve their way of life.

449
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:06,888
人类中有这群人的存在是很重要的

450
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:11,248
他们时刻提醒着我们...

451
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:15,778
人可以有不同的活法

452
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:26,318
他们是地球上最后一群不受约束的人

453
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:36,808
这些人靠融入森林的本领得以生存
Humans have survived here by becoming part of the forest,

454
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,008
但正是这种对森林的依赖性
but it's this specialisation

455
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:42,718
让他们在这变幻莫测的时代显得如此脆弱
that leaves them so vulnerable in these changing times.

456
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,998
这些人掌握着
These people are the guardians

457
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,608
能让人类在大自然中谋得生路的
of a wealth of knowledge and skill

458
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:01,888
难得的知识和技能
that enable humans to forge a life within the natural world.

459
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:10,008
像遥远的西巴布亚部落那样
And there are very few whose existence remains

460
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:12,928
与雨林关系紧密的原始人
as intimately connected with the rainforest

461
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,728
已经寥寥无几了
as the remote tribes of West Papua.

462
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:29,928
科罗威部落完全适应丛林生活
The Korowai are so adapted to life in the jungle,

463
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:31,888
他们以树木为生
they've taken to the trees.

464
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:40,808
这个部落正在建造一座新房子...
This clan is building a new house...

465
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:49,968
但绝不是一座普通的房子
...but it will be no ordinary one.

466
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:55,698
所有物料都是就地取材
All materials must be sourced on site,

467
00:41:56,528 --> 00:42:00,758
砍伐中大量使用的仍是石器时代的工具
and much of the cutting is still done using Stone-Age tools.

468
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:07,218
这是个雄伟的工程
It's an ambitious project.

469
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:10,878
计划是在一棵35米高的树上
The plan is to build their new home

470
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:13,518
建造他们的新家
in a tree 35 metres up.

471
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:20,768
幸好他们选中了一棵铁木
Just as well they've chosen an ironwood,

472
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:23,788
是森林中最结实的树木
the strongest tree in the forest.

473
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,768
第一步是要建一副直达树冠的梯子
The first step is to build a ladder to its crown.

474
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:45,908
这是世上唯一几个住在树屋上的部落
These are the only tribes in the world who live in tree houses

475
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:51,588
他们这么做也是事出有因
and they do so for a number of reasons.

476
00:42:55,168 --> 00:42:57,488
它可以抵御洪水来袭
It's an escape from the floods

477
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,378
和森林地表咬人的昆虫
and the biting insects on the forest floor.

478
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:04,048
它保护他们不受敌人攻击
It offers protection from enemy attack,

479
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,698
但最重要的是
but most of all,

480
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:08,818
这是他们超凡的丛林技艺的体现
it's a display of their jungle prowess.

481
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:13,138
对科罗威人来说  房子越高
For the Korowai, the higher the house,

482
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:14,868
威望就越高
the greater the prestige.

483
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:29,558
科罗威人的技艺也许是独一无二的
The Korowai's skills may be exceptional,

484
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,728
但世界上的建筑工人都大致相同
but builders are the same the world over.

485
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:34,848
能休息一下感觉真好

486
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:39,118
让我们抽根烟吧  谁有火

487
00:43:39,488 --> 00:43:40,898
别闹了

488
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:42,878
万一我们掉下去  那必死无疑啊

489
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:45,528
作为部落中最强壮的攀登者
As one of the clan's strongest climbers,

490
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:49,518
卫欧作为监工  监督着最危险的工作
Wayo is the foreman overseeing the most dangerous jobs.

491
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,918
我们把这绑起来

492
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:55,948
把这枝和那枝砍掉

493
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:58,608
小心点

494
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:02,658
这树太高了  我们最好当心点

495
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:04,258
削掉树枝能让
Thinning the branches keeps

496
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:06,748
房子在刮风时不被吹散
the house from shaking apart in the wind.

497
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:15,378
掉下去就意味着必死无疑
A fall would mean certain death,

498
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:20,868
但在树顶站稳是科罗威人的第二天性
but teetering in tree-tops is second nature to the Korowai.

499
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:27,948
我就知道一个人...

500
00:44:28,138 --> 00:44:32,628
从树屋上掉下来摔死了

501
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:43,448
在搭建房屋的进程中
As the house goes up,

502
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:45,648
更多树倒了下来
more trees come down.

503
00:44:53,828 --> 00:44:56,428
但它们必须从正确的方向倒下去
But they have to fall in the right direction.

504
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:09,718
施工活动紧锣密鼓地进行
Activity on the building site is intense.

505
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,788
雨季很快就要来了
The rainy season is fast approaching

506
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:14,988
还需要加盖屋顶
and the roof still needs to go on.

507
00:45:21,688 --> 00:45:24,678
每个人都在为完成进度竭尽全力
Everyone's pulling their weight to complete on schedule.

508
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:29,738
当我们建造树屋时...

509
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:34,498
我们的邻居都会来帮忙

510
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:36,188
当然...

511
00:45:36,188 --> 00:45:38,478
我们会给与回报

512
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:43,248
房顶是用西谷椰子的树叶平铺加盖的
The roof is tiled with sago-palm leaves

513
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:46,928
地面和墙面用树皮绉做成
and rolls of tree bark make the floor and walls.

514
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:54,058
就算很重也没问题  我壮着呢

515
00:45:54,058 --> 00:45:56,758
我不会掉下去的

516
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:06,158
两周的时间  42个人
In two weeks, with 42 workers,

517
00:46:06,158 --> 00:46:07,808
砍倒了数不清的树
countless felled trees,

518
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,778
用了30捆棕榈叶
30 bundles of palm leaves,

519
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:13,538
16捆树皮和5千米长的麻绳
16 rolls of bark and 5 kilometres of twine,

520
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:15,608
新家完工了
the new home is complete.

521
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:20,968
是时候搬进去了
It's time to move in.

522
00:46:36,688 --> 00:46:39,518
和往常一样  严格的准入政策
As always, modesty dictates

523
00:46:39,518 --> 00:46:41,338
反映了原始人的朴质
a strict entrance policy.

524
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,288
女人总是第二个进去...

525
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:47,718
这样男人就不能看到她们的裙底

526
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:56,008
每样东西都要搬进去  包括宠物
Everything must be carried up, even family pets

527
00:46:56,008 --> 00:47:00,368
要是忘带了什么  下去一趟可够你受的
and it's a long way back down if you forget something.

528
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:11,258
乔迁仪式是点起第一把火
The first fire is ceremonially lit,

529
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,498
对于木质树屋来说
an interesting way

530
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,368
真是个有趣的祈福方式
to bless a wooden tree house,

531
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:17,328
但健康和安全常识
but health and safety regulations

532
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:19,538
还没有普及到这些地区
have yet to reach these parts.

533
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:31,038
孩子们在新家危险的攀爬
Parents are surprisingly relaxed

534
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:34,298
竟没有引起家长们丝毫的担心
as their children explore their limits in the new home.

535
00:47:48,948 --> 00:47:54,888
屋内火焰燃烧  屋外风景怡人...

536
00:47:54,888 --> 00:48:00,438
住在这个美丽的森林里  我们十分满足

537
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:05,968
凭借知识  技艺和创新
Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity

538
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:09,648
雨林居民们已经适应了他们的生存环境
rainforest people have mastered their environment.

539
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:15,768
他们与环境和谐融洽
They live in tune with their surroundings

540
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,678
表现出对自然的尊重
and show it a respect

541
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:19,368
在许多其他地方已不复存在
that's being lost elsewhere.

542
00:48:23,328 --> 00:48:25,458
他们不寻常的生活
Their remarkable lives

543
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:29,348
提醒着我们  没有自然就没有我们
remind us that we are nothing without nature.

544
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:46,868
人类星球
镜头背后的故事

545
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,848
记录巴布亚人建造树屋
Documenting the Papuan tree house build

546
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:58,618
是丛林拍摄组最富挑战的工作
was the most challenging shoot for the Jungles team.

547
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:03,338
为了在树顶拍摄  他们准备了两周
They came prepared for two weeks filming in the tree-tops,

548
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:05,638
但进展不顺时
but when things went wrong,

549
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:07,978
都是科罗威人挽救了大局
it was the Korowai who saved the day.

550
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:18,818
拉哈雨村庄  巴布亚岛
南纬05°30′51″  东经139°17′17″

551
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:22,908
为了拍摄这段影像  摄影师嘉文・瑟斯顿
This shoot took cameraman Gavin Thurston,

552
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:25,818
研究员瑞秋・金丽和制片人汤姆・修琼斯
researcher Rachael Kinley and producer Tom Hugh-Jones

553
00:49:25,818 --> 00:49:28,898
深入到世界上几乎未被开发过的丛林
to some of the least explored jungles in the world.

554
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:32,598
路上大概需要五天
We're about five days into the trip,

555
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:33,778
我们刚刚顺利飞抵这里
we had a safe flight in,

556
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:35,548
嘉文・瑟斯顿
摄影师

557
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:35,648
我们受到了当地人热情的欢迎
we had a very good welcome committee,

558
00:49:35,648 --> 00:49:38,688
我相信还要走上三天才能抵达目的地
and I believe it's about a three-day walk from here.

559
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:44,038
现在回不去了
No going back now.

560
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:49,498
尽管有当地挑夫帮我们减轻了负担
Though local porters help lighten the load,

561
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:52,238
可是在松软潮湿的丛林里徒步前进
trekking through the swampy jungle

562
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,168
远比我们想象的艰难
proves tougher than expected.

563
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:58,078
我刚才在想  如果他跳下水
I thought, if he's going in,

564
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,808
我们也得表示愿意跟着下水
we've got to show willing, haven't we?

565
00:50:00,008 --> 00:50:01,198
我本来是打算帮忙的
I was going to come and help,

566
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,288
结果自己一脚陷了进去
but I've just fallen in.

567
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,468
但是为了为期仅仅两周的拍摄
But with only two weeks' filming,

568
00:50:06,468 --> 00:50:07,718
他们必须日夜兼程
they have to push on.

569
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:13,438
终于  全体摄制组到达拉哈雨村庄
The crew eventually arrive at Lahayu's village

570
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:16,718
并受到科罗威人的热烈欢迎
to a warm welcome, Korowai style.

571
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:21,458
你们好  我亲爱的朋友们

572
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:24,128
这位是妮卡纳
This is Ninkana,

573
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:27,888
瑞秋・金丽
《人类星球》研究员

574
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:26,088
我们刚开始了长达五分钟的握手礼
we are beginning the five minutes of handshake

575
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:28,728
这似乎是你和某人见面时必不可少的
that seems to be necessary when you meet someone.

576
00:50:29,888 --> 00:50:32,328
该谈谈正经事了
Then it's time to talk business.

577
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,328
阿罗姆・拉哈雨
村落首领

578
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:38,778
我会把建房的大树指给客人们看...

579
00:50:38,778 --> 00:50:41,848
如果他们赞成这地点  我们就在那里建

580
00:50:42,198 --> 00:50:45,178
嘉文之前去过一些偏远地带
Gavin's already spotted some local wildlife

581
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:47,038
拍摄野生动物
in unusual places.

582
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,488
这是纳塞  如果我发音正确的话
This is Nasai, if I've got his name right.

583
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:51,048
他戴着这个很神奇的
He's got these amazing, um,

584
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,688
从一只犀鸟身上摘来的毛冠
apart from an amazing hornbill

585
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:54,848
护着睾丸
penis sheath,

586
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:57,588
旁边有一些羽毛
he's got these feathers on the side here.

587
00:50:57,728 --> 00:50:58,838
凤头鹦鹉

588
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:01,168
我想应该是只葵花凤头鹦鹉
I think that's the sulphur-crested cockatoo.

589
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:05,458
很吵的那种  对吗  还有什么
Noisy, yeah? What else?

590
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,288
凤冠鸽

591
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:08,788
鸽子
Pigeon?

592
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:10,618
那是犀鸟
And the hornbill?

593
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,828
差不多了  今天的自然课到此结束
There we are, so that's today's nature lesson!

594
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,588
摄制人员前去查看
The crew go to inspect the ironwood tree

595
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,958
铁木  坚硬的树木和乔木

596
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:21,958
科罗威人选定的铁木
the Korowai have chosen.

597
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:26,528
科罗威人找到了一棵很不错的树
Well, the Korowai have found a really good tree.

598
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:29,008
他们决定在离地面70英尺的树上
It's probably about 70 feet up to where they plan

599
00:51:29,008 --> 00:51:30,328
建造一间树屋
to build the tree house.

600
00:51:30,328 --> 00:51:31,208
看上去不错
It's looking good.

601
00:51:32,628 --> 00:51:35,678
为了给摄像机架个位置
A line is fired into a nearby tree

602
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:37,288
我们从附近一棵大树拉起一根线
to rig a camera position

603
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:40,258
但绳索被缠住了
but the rope gets caught.

604
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:43,648
他们的一个人正往那里爬
One of these guys has just shinned right up there.

605
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:46,468
这种攀爬方式真令人难以置信
It's unbelievable climbing.

606
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:49,078
我只能说  如果是别人这样爬上去
All I can say is, if that was anybody else up there,

607
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,678
我的心一定都提到嗓子眼了
my heart would be in my throat,

608
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:51,948
但他看上去非常轻松自在
but he just looks so at ease.

609
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:57,118
多亏了科罗威人  问题解决了
Problem solved, thanks to the Korowai.

610
00:51:58,428 --> 00:52:00,268
现在绳索问题解决了
Now the ropes are up,

611
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:02,288
嘉文成了另一个焦点
it's Gavin's turn to impress.

612
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,768
我想这些人一定很惊讶
I think these guys are fascinated

613
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:08,578
我们爬上一棵树竟需要这么多装备
by how much paraphernalia we need to get up a tree.

614
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:12,278
尤其是我还无法熟练使用它们
Especially when I can't do it properly.

615
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:19,228
科罗威人开始以惊人的速度建造房屋
The Korowai begin building at an astonishing rate,

616
00:52:20,048 --> 00:52:22,878
使得嘉文不得不拼命追赶他们的进度
leaving Gavin struggling to keep up.

617
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:26,818
当他终于进入状态时
Just as he gets into the swing of things,

618
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:28,488
一场大雨不期而至
rain stops play.

619
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:33,528
真不敢相信雨已经整整下了17个小时
It's been raining for 17 hours solid, I can't believe it.

620
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:35,828
在雨天攀爬非常危险
When it's this wet it's not safe for them to climb,

621
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:37,298
木头都很滑
the logs are really slippery.

622
00:52:37,298 --> 00:52:38,818
地下水位已经上升了不少
The water table has risen so much now

623
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:40,428
到处都是水  我们只能站在水里
we've got standing water everywhere,

624
00:52:40,968 --> 00:52:42,868
还有一个更为不幸的消息就是
and the other detail you probably don't want to know

625
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,278
这雨不仅下了很久  而且雨势很大
is that the long drop too is completely full.

626
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,408
因为工作停滞不前
With work at a standstill,

627
00:52:49,408 --> 00:52:52,038
摄制小组被邀请到家里做客
the crew are invited for a social visit.

628
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:53,858
"这就是儿时的梦想
'It's a childhood dream.

629
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:55,618
"在我最初的记忆里
'It's one of my first memories

630
00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:57,208
"大概六七岁左右
"--when I was about six or seven,

631
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,038
"就想在花园里的苹果树上
"building a tree house about four foot off the ground

632
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:00,538
"建造一个离地四英尺的小树屋
"in an apple tree in the garden

633
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:03,768
"如今我要拍摄这些建造小树屋的能手了"
"and here I am coming to film the world experts."

634
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:07,228
所有的科罗威人的房屋都有男女分区
All Korowai houses are split into gender zones

635
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:11,118
而在女士这边
and, on the women's side,

636
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:13,078
瑞秋很受关注
Rachael's attracting a lot of attention.

637
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:18,728
她们似乎想把我打扮得更本土一点
They seem to be wanting to get me to dress a bit like them.

638
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:23,618
很快她看上去就有点当地味道了
Before long she's going native.

639
00:53:28,268 --> 00:53:30,288
比预期的更像些
A little more than expected.

640
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,458
裙子系紧后
With the skirt safely fastened,

641
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,868
她就可以把裤子脱掉了
all that's left is for her to lose her trousers.

642
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:43,818
我们花了两个小时与他们亲密相处
We've had two hours of bonding with these people.

643
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,388
就这样坐下来  逐渐了解这座村落
It's just been really nice to sit down

644
00:53:46,528 --> 00:53:50,068
汤姆・修琼斯
《人类星球》制片人

645
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:48,168
和他们分享一些笑话
and get to know the tribe

646
00:53:48,168 --> 00:53:49,838
让他们嘲笑嘲笑我们
and to share some jokes with them,

647
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:50,808
了解他们的生活
let them laugh at us

648
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:52,708
这感觉真好
and see a bit of their life.

649
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,248
雨停了  科罗威人继续工作
When the rain stops, the Korowai get going

650
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:02,218
可是嘉文却被他的绳索齿轮耽误了
but Gavin's being encumbered by all his gear.

651
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:05,988
我真想知道以前有没有人拍到过
I wonder if anybody's ever filmed

652
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:07,478
挂在绳子上心脏病发作
a heart attack on a rope before.

653
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:11,848
一旦到达树顶
Once at the top of the tree,

654
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:14,258
嘉文的设备就很管用了
Gavin's kit comes into its own.

655
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:18,098
这个装置很不错  叫做树架
This is quite a clever device, called a tree pod.

656
00:54:18,098 --> 00:54:19,538
上面有一些爪
It's got a couple of spikes

657
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:20,868
把它捆在树上
and when you strap it to the tree

658
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:22,298
就能形成一个很稳固的底座
you get a really good solid base.

659
00:54:22,298 --> 00:54:23,838
再把摄像机架在上面
The camera goes on top of there.

660
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,668
他们选定的那棵建造小屋的大树
The tree they've chosen to put the tree house in,

661
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:31,818
是方圆百里最高的树
turns out it's the tallest tree for a good few hundred metres.

662
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,878
我们想要的效果
And one thing we wanted to do

663
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:34,858
就是可以拍到
is be able to see

664
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,288
树屋所处的大环境
the tree house in its environment,

665
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:37,288
拍到它直冲云霄
in the canopy,

666
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:38,308
拍出居高临下的感觉
and give a sense of height.

667
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:42,698
房屋至少有十层楼高
It must be getting on for ten storeys high

668
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:45,058
用的是枝条和藤蔓
and just made out of sticks and rattan.

669
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,468
真是一项不可思议的工程
It's quite an incredible bit of engineering.

670
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:51,088
在整个建造树上小屋的过程中
The whole time they've been building this tree house,

671
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:53,138
有一些非常惊险的瞬间
there have just been really scary moments.

672
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:56,798
那里有棵他们想推倒的大树
Right now there's quite a large tree they're trying to fell

673
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,058
但又担心它向小屋的方向倒下
but they're worried it might fall towards the tree house

674
00:54:59,058 --> 00:54:59,988
从而带倒树梯
and take out the ladder.

675
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,528
所以不能全体出动
So instead of everybody getting out the tree house,

676
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:04,858
而是由三个人手执长杆
there's three guys with long poles

677
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:05,898
来推动大树
just pushing it out the way

678
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:08,928
下面还有两个人用藤条牵拉大树
and they've got two more down here with a bit of rattan

679
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:09,838
希望它可以往
pulling it, in the hope that

680
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,698
远离平台的一边倒下
it will go away from the platform,

681
00:55:11,698 --> 00:55:12,888
一旦方向错误
but if it goes the wrong way,

682
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:14,548
这三个人必死无疑
those three guys are going to die!

683
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:22,268
有一棵树倒下了
Another tree falls.

684
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:25,728
这次位置有些太靠近了
This time it's a little too close for comfort.

685
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:28,648
幸运的是他们的判断准确无误
Luckily, they judged that one right

686
00:55:28,648 --> 00:55:29,878
没有冲我们这面来
and it didn't come our way.

687
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:37,278
工程即将完工
The building's near completion,

688
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:40,258
嘉文还要拍一组小屋大全景
but Gavin still has to shoot the big reveal.

689
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:43,338
我们要从小屋所在的大树拉一根线出来
We've set up a line from the tree the tree house is in

690
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:45,708
穿越至我拍摄用的树架所在的地方
across to where I was filming from the tree pod.

691
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,978
把摄影移动车挂在线上
We're going to put the cable dolly on

692
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:48,538
拍出一组可以看到小屋
and get a really nice pull back

693
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:51,178
处在云端之下的后拉镜头
to reveal the tree house right up in the canopy.

694
00:55:54,378 --> 00:55:55,268
求求你了  宝贝
Please, baby.

695
00:55:56,268 --> 00:55:57,598
它不动了
It won't go anywhere.

696
00:55:57,598 --> 00:55:58,848
发生什么了
What has happened?

697
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:01,948
它死机了
It's died!

698
00:56:03,018 --> 00:56:05,768
这可是第一次
For the first time ever.

699
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:07,988
太糟了
Oh!

700
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:14,178
科罗威人又一次拯救了我们
Yet again, the Korowai come to the rescue.

701
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:19,498
这是科罗威的传统手工艺品
Traditional Korowai craftsmanship,

702
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:23,258
一根末端绑上枯枝的长棍
a stick with another little bit of stick tied on the end.

703
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:25,218
过来宝贝
Come on, baby!

704
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:30,498
嘉文及时在晚饭前收回了摄影移动车
Gavin retrieves the camera dolly in time for supper.

705
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,318
食物都快吃完了
Food supplies are running low

706
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,188
所以科罗威人奉上了一道当地美食
so the Korowai serve up a local delicacy.

707
00:56:37,378 --> 00:56:38,418
西米蛴螬
Sago grubs.

708
00:56:38,418 --> 00:56:41,068
是生活在西谷米里的
They're basically giant

709
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:43,748
一种甲虫的幼虫
beetle grubs that live inside the sago palms.

710
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,698
而且很美味
And they are a delicacy.

711
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,758
最后喀吱嚼到它们的牙齿时
The crunch at the end when you chew their teeth

712
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:48,908
可能感觉不太好
perhaps isn't the best.

713
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:49,968
不过除此之外  还算不错
But other than that they are all right.

714
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:53,568
你一直说你需要吃蛋白质
You kept saying you wanted protein.

715
00:56:56,598 --> 00:56:57,428
他要吐了
He's gagging!

716
00:56:57,838 --> 00:56:59,698
我觉得吃上去有点像鱼子酱
I think they taste like caviar.

717
00:56:59,698 --> 00:57:01,068
嘴里有那种清脆的爆裂声
It's got that pop in your mouth.

718
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:02,418
-你喜欢吃吗  -嗯
- Do you like them? - Mmmm.

719
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,898
-你可以吃我的  -谢谢  多来点
- You can have the rest, then. - Ah! Thanks. Some more!

720
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,658
对于西米蛴螬的最终体会是
The verdict on the sago grubs is,

721
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,738
它们是可食用的
they are edible

722
00:57:09,738 --> 00:57:12,118
但也实在是太令人作呕了
but they are actually pretty disgusting!

723
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:14,048
我还在嚼着呢
I'm still chewing!

724
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:17,478
今天是最后一天
It's the final day and

725
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:20,548
也是嘉文拍摄大全景的最后一次机会
Gavin's last chance to shoot the grand finale.

726
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:23,578
今天可是天时地利  阳光耀眼
Today, it's all come together. The sun's shining,

727
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:25,318
大家都在帮忙
the guys are being helpful

728
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,058
摄像移动车也工作正常
and the cable dolly is behaving itself

729
00:57:27,058 --> 00:57:28,798
希望这将是这个节目
and hopefully, this is the

730
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:30,678
和这组镜头的最后一次拍摄
end shot for the sequence and the programme.

731
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:39,838
亲眼目睹了在如此高处建造房屋的全过程
It's just been incredible seeing the whole process

732
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:43,098
令人感觉不可思议
of how they build the house this high up in the canopy.

733
00:57:43,098 --> 00:57:44,468
他们似乎非常适应新环境
They seem to have settled in very well.

734
00:57:44,468 --> 00:57:45,708
大多数人都已经睡着了
Most of them are asleep now.

735
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:50,618
事实上我也精疲力尽
I'm knackered as well, actually.

736
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:54,718
和科罗威人一起度过的这段时间
Spending time with the Korowai

737
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:57,848
使得嘉文对生命又有了新的思考
has given Gavin a different perspective on life.

738
00:57:57,848 --> 00:57:59,578
相较于他们的技能与知识
I judge my own inadequacies

739
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:02,098
我重新审视了自己的不足
against their expertise and knowledge.

740
00:58:02,408 --> 00:58:03,548
来到这里
You come here

741
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:05,608
你穿着靴子以防蛇咬
and you've got boots on in case of snake bites,

742
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,508
你涂着防晒霜以防烈日
you've got sun cream on because of the sun,

743
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:10,668
你有两根保险绳  这样一根断了
you've got twin safety ropes to make sure, if one fails,

744
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:12,238
你还能抓住另一根
you are caught on the other one.

745
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,698
而这些人
And these guys, OK,

746
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,258
也许死亡率很高
maybe they have a higher mortality rate,

747
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,578
但他们的生活方式却更自由
but they're much freer in their lifestyle.

748
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,418
他们在树林间上上下下
You know, they're shinning up and down these trees.

749
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:22,708
我更愿意像他们一样
I'd much rather live a shorter,

750
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,668
活得虽然不长  却更为充实
fuller life, like they do out here.
