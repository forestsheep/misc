1
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:09,789
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,999
在地球的每一个角落都留下了印迹
in every habitat on earth.

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:16,139
那就是人类
That creature is us.

4
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:19,949
天地悠悠
All over the world,

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,529
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
we still use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

6
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,779
远离文明开化的城市
far from the city lights,

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,799
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

8
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:50,369
海洋覆盖了地球表面的70%
The sea covers 70% of our planet's surface.

9
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:55,749
四分之三的地球生物以海洋为家
It's home to three-quarters of all life on Earth.

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,269
所有徜徉其中的生物
All the creatures found here are perfectly adapted

11
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,759
都在这里生息繁衍
to thrive in the ocean...

12
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,339
只有一个例外
..all except one.

13
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:34,339
我们并非为水而生
We are not evolved for a life aquatic...

14
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:37,409
这个危险陌生的环境
..and we're way out of our depth

15
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,699
超乎了我们的极限
in this dangerous and alien world.

16
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,149
但是对于那些敢于探险的人们来说
But great opportunities await those people

17
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,849
巨大的机遇就在前方
who dare to venture into the water.

18
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,069
我们一步步向海洋的深处进发
As we immerse ourselves ever deeper in the big blue,

19
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,429
如何克服面对的这些巨大挑战呢
how do we overcome the enormous challenges that confront us?

20
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:27,289
海洋

21
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:27,289
深入蔚蓝世界

22
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:37,249
人类和海洋的联系始于海岸线
Our relationship with the ocean begins on the coast.

23
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,849
即使在这里  海洋的力量也不容小觑
Even here, the sea is a force to be reckoned with.

24
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,009
西班牙北部的加利西亚地区
Galicia, in Northern Spain,

25
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:51,879
绵延着欧洲最为凶险的海岸线之一
is home to one of Europe's most treacherous coasts.

26
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,389
但如果你像哈维尔和安格尔一样愿意冒险
But the more extreme the conditions, the greater the rewards,

27
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,539
那么环境越是恶劣
if, like Javier and Angel,

28
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,829
回报就越是丰厚
you're prepared to take the risk.

29
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,739
我的老天...

30
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,949
相当有挑战啊

31
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:18,259
兄弟你要是先走一步...

32
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,259
你先来吧...

33
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,839
你先来...

34
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,249
哈维尔和安格尔两人来捕获一种奇特生物
Javier and Angel are on the hunt for a strange creature

35
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:27,099
它们附着在被海浪拍打的岩石表面
that clings to the wave-battered rocks...

36
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,019
位于这些悬崖峭壁的最深处
at the bottom of these cliffs.

37
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,119
他们行动要快
They have to move fast.

38
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:48,239
他们的猎物只会在潮退时显露出来
Their quarry is only exposed at low tide.

39
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,209
加油啊
Vamos! Arriba! Arriba!

40
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,329
小心

41
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,299
好了...

42
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,299
现在下手

43
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,289
他们想捕获的叫鹅藤壶
It's goose barnacles they're after,

44
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,959
一千克能卖到200欧价格的珍稀海味
a highly prized delicacy that can sell for 200 euros a kilo.

45
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,969
但是捕获却极其困难
But it's not easy pickings.

46
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,049
每年都有五名左右的捕获者为此丧命
Each year, about five collectors die.

47
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,769
如此艰险的工作鲜有人问津
Few dare work when it's this rough.

48
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,199
但那些真正的勇士可以靠此赚个盆满钵满
But those who do can charge a premium for their harvest.

49
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,049
小心这个浪头...

50
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,339
在海浪的猛击下  哈维尔满载而归
Despite the onslaught, Javier's filled his bag.

51
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:59,039
现在该安格尔了
Now it's Angel's turn,

52
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,259
尽管海浪愈发汹涌
and though it's getting even rougher...

53
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,599
他还是去了  并且没系安全绳
..he's going in with no safety rope.

54
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:16,849
不系绳子可以让他穿梭于海浪之中
Working unattached allows him to dash between waves

55
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,649
抵达最低的一些岩石
and reach the lowest rocks,

56
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,399
那里的鹅藤壶个头也最大
where the biggest barnacles grow.

57
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,009
但是稍微一滑就是致命的
But one slip could be fatal.

58
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:34,439
尽管海浪又一次袭来
Although the tide's coming in,

59
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,169
安格尔却没打算收手
Angel's determined to collect more.

60
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,529
哈维尔和安格尔的赌博得到了回报
Javier and Angel's gamble paid off.

61
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,169
短短两小时  他们捕获的鹅藤壶
In two hours, they've gathered enough goose barnacles

62
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,659
足够让他们进账800欧了
to fetch around 800 euros.

63
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,179
收成不错的一天
Not bad for a day at the seaside.

64
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,949
你得用绳子

65
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,949
要捕这么大个的

66
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,129
没错...

67
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,129
把自己吊起来

68
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,619
正是这些丰富的物产诱使我们一次次的冒险
It's this abundance of food that entices us into the waves.

69
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,429
但是海岸线再向外延伸一点的地方
And just a little further out,

70
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,849
有着更多的宝藏
there are even greater riches.

71
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,929
大陆架水域只占世界海洋面积的十分之一
Coastal waters account for just one-tenth of the world's oceans,

72
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,399
但它们却孕育着大量丰富的海洋物种
but they're home to the vast majority of marine life.

73
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,669
问题在于  探险的地方离开海岸越远
The trouble is, as we venture further from the shore,

74
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,829
危险系数就越高
the dangers escalate.

75
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,969
本杰明努力成为一名捕鲸能手
Benjamin's training to be a harpoonist

76
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,969
他深知  总有一天
and he knows, any day now,

77
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,519
学到的东西将面临真刀真枪的考验
all he's learned could be put to the test.

78
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,829
出海捕鲸之前...

79
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:20,469
我们都十分紧张...

80
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,659
...但如果不去

81
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,659
就没有食物

82
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:31,059
他住在印度尼西亚一个叫兰伯塔的小岛上
He lives on a small Indonesian island called Lembata.

83
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,939
这片土地很贫瘠  很难生长作物
Few crops grow in this rocky land,

84
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,609
就连活下来都是一个巨大的挑战
and even surviving from the sea is a struggle.

85
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,249
但是他们等待着一种动物的出现
But there's one animal they wait for

86
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,219
它们能让村民们一夜致富
that can dramatically change their fortunes.

87
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,659
鲸鱼  鲸鱼

88
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,409
鲸鱼  鲸鱼

89
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,979
全村上下迅速行动起来
The whole village springs into action.

90
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,719
他们要抓紧时间出海
It's a race against time to get out to sea.

91
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:43,569
本杰明和他的乡亲们要捕获的
Benjamin and the rest of the crew

92
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:47,139
是有史以来最大的食肉动物
are about to take on the biggest predator that's ever lived.

93
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,259
鲸鱼的尾部和头部

94
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,259
强健有力...

95
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,699
...能使我们全都

96
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,699
死翘翘

97
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,029
他们都很清楚面临的危险
They all know the risks,

98
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,809
但是如此这般的好机会  失不再来
but opportunities don't come much bigger than this.

99
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:08,869
抹香鲸
The sperm whale.

100
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,959
身长可达18米
Up to 18 metres long,

101
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,489
这些无敌的海中巨物威猛无比
these mighty leviathans are powerful animals

102
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,969
它们绝不会束手就擒
and they won't go down without a fight.

103
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:30,289
只凭借简陋的小木筏和手工捕鱼器
With simple wooden boats and handmade weapons,

104
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,659
村民们看起来没什么胜算
the whalers seem ill-prepared for battle,

105
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,939
但是六百多年来一直都是这样过来的
but this is how it's been for 600 years.

106
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,749
只有当鲸浮上来呼吸的时候他们才有机会
They can only harpoon the whale when it surfaces to breathe...

107
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,529
因此动作必须要快
..so they need to move fast.

108
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,219
本杰明表哥准备向抹香鲸发出舍身一击
Benjamin's brother prepares to launch himself at the whale.

109
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,809
这是整个过程最危险的一步
This is the most dangerous moment of all.

110
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,539
但他失手了
But he misses...

111
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,729
现在趁它潜下去之前必须有勇士挺身而出
..and now someone else must step up before the whale dives.

112
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,429
本杰明大显身手的时候到了
Benjamin's moment has arrived.

113
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,749
他成功了
He's got it.

114
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:51,779
但是斗争才刚刚开始
But the battle has just begun.

115
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,829
这条抹香鲸开始挣扎反抗
As the whale fights to break free,

116
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,839
村民们调整位置  想再次戳中它
they move to harpoon it again.

117
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,829
他们必须防止它潜下  从底部攻击船只
They need to prevent it from diving and pulling a boat under.

118
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,489
但这些还不够
But it's not enough.

119
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,019
村民们忌惮它强有力的尾巴
Terrified of the thrashing whale,

120
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,329
于是聚在了一起
the crew scramble to safety.

121
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,219
另一条船加入了捕获抹香鲸的战斗
Another boat attacks and harpoons the whale once more.

122
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:56,149
同时拖拉好几条船
Now dragging several boats,

123
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,689
这条鲸慢慢泄气了
the whale slowly tires.

124
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,189
终于  它无力反抗
Eventually, its struggles are exhausted

125
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:18,759
他们对着它的后背骨来了最后一击
and a final cut, through its backbone, is made.

126
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:38,309
在这次历经八小时的史诗般的鏖战中
It's been an epic eight-hour battle,

127
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,289
本杰明表现出了他的技艺和勇气
but Benjamin has shown his skill and bravery...

128
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,899
这次捕猎没有人员伤亡
..and this time everyone returns safely home.

129
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,169
一条鲸的死亡也许会让我们潸然泪下
The death of a whale may be sad to us,

130
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,309
但这是村民们赖以生存的命根
but this is their lifeline.

131
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,299
一次捕杀可以提供整个村子几个月的食物
One catch can feed a village for months,

132
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,099
而这种在兰伯塔岛上进行的小规模捕猎
and this small-scale hunt in Lembata

133
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:09,219
不会影响到海洋里的鲸鱼数量
doesn't threaten whale numbers in these oceans.

134
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,739
他们一年大概只捕获6条左右
They only take around six whales a year.

135
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,039
抹香鲸浑身都是宝
Nothing is wasted.

136
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,409
家家户户都能分到一份肉
The meat is shared out.

137
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:21,979
作为完成致命一击的勇士
As the man who dealt the decisive blow,

138
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,579
本杰明得到的那份更多一些
Benjamin gets a larger share.

139
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:30,279
至少一段时间内  他的家人不会受饿
And for a while at least, his family won't be going hungry.

140
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,329
尽管我们进化成为了适合陆地生存的物种
Although we've evolved for a life on land,

141
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,419
我们却成为了颇有效率的海洋猎手
we've become remarkably efficient oceanic hunters.

142
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,049
良好的适应性引领着人类
Adaptability is the secret of our success

143
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,909
在探索海洋的过程中不断迸发新的灵感
at discovering new ways to exploit the ocean.

144
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,339
在一些特别的地区
And in a few special places,

145
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,559
这意味着借助海洋生物的帮忙
this means working with the creatures of the sea.

146
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:14,569
巴西拉瓜那地区的渔民们
These fishermen of Laguna in Brazil

147
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:17,689
在人类和野生动物之间建立了一种
have forged one of the most extraordinary partnerships

148
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,729
整个地球独一无二的合作伙伴关系
between humans and wild animals found anywhere on Earth.

149
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:29,309
爱德生起了个大早去捕捞
Edson is up early to fish

150
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,139
每年五月都溯游经过此地的大批鲻鱼
the large numbers of mullet that migrate through these waters every May.

151
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,219
但是有一个麻烦
But there's a problem.

152
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,979
海水很浑浊
The water's so murky

153
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,949
渔民们拿不准应该在何处撒网
the fishermen can't see where to cast their nets.

154
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,979
所以他们与海洋中最聪明的动物携手
So they join forces with the most intelligent animal in the sea.

155
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,029
然而  正如人际交往中的一样
But, like all relationships,

156
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,429
心急吃不了热豆腐
a certain amount of patience is required.

157
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,339
终于  他们的帮手浮出了海面
Finally, their friends surface.

158
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:16,779
当地的瓶鼻海豚在拉瓜那地区可是大名鼎鼎
The local bottlenose dolphins are celebrities in Laguna.

159
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:20,359
事实上是  爱德生和他伙伴艾尔弗雷多
In fact, Edson and his pal Alfredo

160
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,249
能够叫出每一只的名字
know each one by name.

161
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:25,619
费格雷多 会帮我们

162
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:25,619
逮到大批大批的鱼...

163
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:31,399
...那是 斯库布

164
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:31,399
没错  是他

165
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,509
难以置信的是
Incredibly,

166
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,709
海豚们把鲻鱼往渔民们处赶
the dolphins drive the mullet towards the fishermen,

167
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,849
甚至还会通过这些独特的潜水动作
and even signal when to cast their nets,

168
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:41,909
发出撒网的信号
with these distinctive dives.

169
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,099
渔民说  他们可以通过
The fishermen say they can tell the size of the school,

170
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,059
海豚下潜的力量与方向
and which way it's travelling

171
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,819
分辨出鱼群的规模和游动的方向
from the vigour and direction of the dive.

172
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:16,819
海豚完成了捕鱼过程中最难的部分
The dolphins do the hard work herding the mullet.

173
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,629
鱼儿成了渔民的盘中餐
The fish are served to the fishermen on a plate...

174
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,429
可是海豚能获得什么呢  人们却不清楚
...but what the dolphins stand to gain is less clear.

175
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:31,549
既然它们可以通过回声侦测到猎物
Since they detect prey by echolocation,

176
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,269
那肯定能在浑浊的水里捕猎
they have no problem hunting in the murky water,

177
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,039
但是从整个鱼群中捕捉个体十分困难
but picking off individuals from the school is more difficult.

178
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:43,269
渔网似乎使鱼儿惊慌失措而四散逃窜
It seems the nets panic the fish into breaking formation,

179
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,589
对于海豚来说也更容易追捕到食物
making them much easier for the dolphins to chase down.

180
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,019
随着渔网一点点收紧
As the nets are hauled in,

181
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,369
团队合作的好处便显现出来
the benefits of teamwork are revealed.

182
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,389
埃德森和其他渔民很清楚
Edson and the other fishermen have no doubt

183
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:18,369
海豚帮了他们多大的忙
how much the dolphins help them.

184
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,709
今天海豚表现

185
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,709
真不错...

186
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:25,549
有十三多公斤

187
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:30,909
一次撒网就捕到八十多条鲻鱼

188
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,989
无论我们如何获取海产品
No matter how we catch it,

189
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,229
它们对人类的生存都至关重要
seafood is vital to human survival,

190
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,769
世界一半人口的蛋白质供应
providing the main source of protein

191
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:05,239
都来自海产品
for about half the world's population.

192
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,029
我们与大海长久以来的紧密联系
But there's a lot more to our ancient connection

193
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,089
远远不止食物这么简单
with the sea than just food.

194
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,149
我们越是依赖海洋
The more we've come to depend on the ocean,

195
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,269
越是开拓海洋广阔的边疆
and the further we've pushed into its vast frontier,

196
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,899
它对我们生活的影响也就越明显
the greater its influence has become in our lives.

197
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,749
太平洋覆盖了地球三分之一的面积
The Pacific covers one-third of the globe.

198
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:43,109
大洋正中的一丛零星小岛
The tiny specks of land in the middle of it

199
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,579
大概是人类所能抵达之极
are about as remote as life can get for a human being.

200
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:01,429
海岛的陆地如此之少
With so few options on land,

201
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,859
使得周围的海域几乎支撑起了
the surrounding ocean underpins almost

202
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:07,009
太平洋上生命的方方面面
every aspect of life on a Pacific island.

203
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:22,509
在距离大陆超过三千平方米的海域上
Over 3,000 kilometres from the nearest continent,

204
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,619
夏威夷是最为偏远的海岛之一
Hawaii is one of the most isolated of all.

205
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,949
海洋对人类生存的影响
There are few places where the sea has had

206
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:33,789
在这里体现得淋漓尽致  无处可比
a greater impact on human existence.

207
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,549
大海对我们意义深远  它就是我们的家园
The ocean, significantly to us, it's our home.

208
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,099
我们的联系如此紧密
Our connection is so great,

209
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:00,189
我们视她为生命的源头
we look at it as our origin.

210
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:01,369
水即我们  我们即水
The water is who we are,

211
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,069
她是我们的生身父母
and the water is our mother, our father,

212
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,459
是我们的神明
our gods.

213
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,919
对土生土长的夏威夷人来说
For Tom "Pohako" Stone,

214
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,099
在海洋中尽情地展示技术
displaying his skill in the ocean

215
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,709
是他们最重要的能力
is a central part of what it means to be Hawaiian.

216
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,549
在碧波中逐流
Sliding on waves, as it was known,

217
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,429
是波利尼亚人几千年来的传统
has been practised by the Polynesians for millennia.

218
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,639
但那毕竟是一千年前
But it was around 1,000 years ago,

219
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,639
他们来到了夏威夷之后
when they arrived in Hawaii,

220
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,979
这项传统变逐渐演化成了冲浪
that it evolved into surfing.

221
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,059
当我们真正
When we actually learned t

222
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,989
学会了制作滑板
hat we could construct boards

223
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,429
站立起来冲浪
to stand up and surf a wave,

224
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,269
它便成为了我们文化中
it became a very ritualistic

225
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,549
根深蒂固的一部分
component of our culture.

226
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,149
对于居住在夏威夷的祖先而言
Far more than just a sport,

227
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,399
冲浪不仅是一项运动
surfing was a sacred art form

228
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,229
更是一门神圣的艺术
for Tom's ancestors.

229
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,629
这是他们社会的核心内容
It was a core part of their society,

230
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:00,879
是勇士  国王  王后
and the noble pursuit

231
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:04,549
才配追求的崇高目标
of warriors, kings and queens.

232
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,009
女性冲浪在我们这里历史悠久
We have a lot of history about women that...that surf,

233
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,709
她们的技术非常高超
and, you know, they surfed so well

234
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,599
达到了神一般的境界
that they actually reached godly status.

235
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,269
我们很尊敬这些女性
We revered these women.

236
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,219
有着古老起源的冲浪
From ancient origins,

237
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:40,749
现如今已风靡全球
surfing has now gone global.

238
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:44,749
对有些人而言  追逐自己的生命之旅
And for some, searching for the ride of your life

239
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:47,179
已经成为一种执着的迷恋
has become an extreme obsession.

240
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,699
2009年12月9日
December 9th, 2009.

241
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,629
全世界的冲浪精英齐聚于夏威夷
The world's surfing elite has gathered in Hawaii

242
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,529
踏上十年来最高的浪尖
to ride some of the biggest swells

243
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,969
在海滨边尽情戏耍
to hit these shores in over a decade.

244
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,659
冲浪本身已发生了许多变化
Surfing's certainly changed,

245
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,479
但对很多人来说  它依旧是一种生活方式
but for many it's still a way of life

246
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,509
最棒的冲浪骑手依旧被奉为
and the best riders are still revered as gods

247
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,209
世界范围内冲浪人的神人
amongst the worldwide surfing tribe.

248
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:52,119
巨浪高达15米  有5层楼的高度
With waves over 15 metres, five storeys high,

249
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,959
这是技巧和耐力的真正考验
this is a real test of skill and stamina.

250
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,149
肯・布拉德肖因能驾驭26米高的海浪而闻名
Ken Bradshaw is famed for taming a 26-metre wave,

251
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,189
这可能是目前的最高纪录
probably the biggest ever ridden.

252
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,249
但是这些无法预知的浪潮
But these unpredictable swells

253
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:32,229
仍有可能夺去最有经验的冲浪者的性命
can claim even the most seasoned surfer.

254
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,069
陷入这样一座翻滚的浪山中
Trapped in a rolling mountain of white water,

255
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,269
肯就像洗衣机里的洋娃娃一般翻滚不止
Ken is tossed around like a rag doll in a washing machine.

256
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:06,169
他刚浮出水面
Just as he surfaces,

257
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:08,379
又是一波巨浪呼啸而来
another giant breaker comes crashing in.

258
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,989
在六波海浪连续无情的冲击之后
After a relentless pounding from six successive waves,

259
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:34,429
肯终于安全逃了出来
Ken eventually escapes in one piece.

260
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,389
所有的巨浪爱好者都知道有风险
All big wave surfers know the risks,

261
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:46,269
但肾上腺素和荣耀却是致瘾的
but the adrenaline and the glory is addictive.

262
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,109
正如古老的夏威夷人发现的那样
And just as the ancient Hawaiians discovered,

263
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,429
冲浪依旧是对人类
surfing is still the most

264
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,649
征服海洋这一能力的最壮丽的诠释
spectacular demonstration of our ability to conquer the waves.

265
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,019
我们对大海的驾驭令人惊叹
Our mastery of the sea is impressive,

266
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,849
但它的狂暴永远无法被我们驯服
but we'll never tame its full fury.

267
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,189
12月9日这天的滔天巨浪
The enormous waves of December 9th

268
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:08,729
是太平洋强大的
were created by intense

269
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:12,069
热带气旋活动一手创造的
tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific.

270
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:17,099
当暖流为海洋上空
When warm waters fuel

271
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:19,349
低气压推波助澜
the ferocity of depressions over the ocean,

272
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:22,989
它们便会联手创造地球上最为恶劣的环境
they can create the most violent weather systems on Earth.

273
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:27,589
在狂风暴雨的时节
People must stay well away from the raging sea

274
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,549
人们一定要远离凶猛的大海
during these tempestuous times,

275
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,949
但他们却无法抑制内心的渴望
but they can't stop it coming to them.

276
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,949
这些时速达到
These super-storms,

277
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:44,069
300公里的超级风暴
with winds of over 300 kilometres per hour,

278
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,349
肆虐人类世界
wreak havoc on the human world.

279
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,859
从重创中恢复过来可能要数十年
It can take years to recover from the destruction.

280
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:06,429
有时  那些半径超过1600公里的飓风和台风
Sometimes over 1,600 kilometres wide,

281
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,719
是海洋那可敬又可畏的力量
hurricanes and typhoons are persistent reminders

282
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:12,339
最好的见证
of the ocean's awesome force.

283
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:18,109
无怪乎沿海居民
It's little wonder that coastal people

284
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,029
对于这非凡的水域
look at these mighty waters

285
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:21,749
怀有最崇高的敬意
with great reverence...

286
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:26,629
但这不仅仅是因为海洋强大的力量
...but not just for the power of the ocean,

287
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:30,379
还有水里居住的生物们
but also the power of the creatures that live in it.

288
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,799
在离巴布新几内亚不远的群岛上
In the islands off Papua New Guinea,

289
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,989
布莱斯被认为是海洋巫师
Blais is known as a sorcerer of the sea.

290
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,809
他是仅剩的几个
Possessing the mysterious ability

291
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,529
拥有神秘的召唤深海鲨鱼能力的
to summon sharks from the deep,

292
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:55,989
鲨鱼召唤者之一
he's one of the last so-called shark callers,

293
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:59,689
这是一种披上了迷信色彩的传统狩猎技术
a traditional hunting technique steeped in superstition.

294
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:06,039
鲨鱼在我们的世界里是极受尊敬的生物

295
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,269
我们会向鲨鱼的灵魂歌唱...

296
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,109
祈求它允许我们捕捉它

297
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,499
布莱斯很尊敬宗教礼仪
Blais respects ritual,

298
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:38,599
但他同样知晓鲨鱼的习性
but he also understands shark behaviour.

299
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,689
在水里拨弄出咔嗒的声音
Rattling in the water

300
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,589
可以模仿喂鱼的行为
mimics the activity of feeding fish.

301
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,859
鲨鱼可以从三公里外
Sharks can detect these vibrations

302
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,879
就探测到这种振动
from three kilometres away,

303
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,779
但它们不一定会响应
but they don't always respond.

304
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,499
真正的鲨鱼召唤者有

305
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,499
足够的耐心...

306
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:08,759
...忍受数小时的

307
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:08,759
等待

308
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:20,479
由于捕鱼业重挫了鲨鱼数量
And as industrial fishing decimates shark numbers,

309
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:23,759
等待也愈加长久
the waits are getting even longer.

310
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,949
终于  一条灰色的礁鲨从深海中现身了
Finally, a grey reef shark emerges from the blue.

311
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:42,549
布莱斯抚慰了它的灵魂
Blais has appeased its spirit.

312
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:47,209
但现在  他必须抓住它
But now he has to catch it,

313
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:49,609
而鲨鱼又是出了名的反复无常
and sharks are notoriously skittish.

314
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,909
这是一个猫捉老鼠的游戏
It's a game of cat and mouse.

315
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,679
布莱斯试图将鲨鱼引诱到身边
Blais tries to entice the shark

316
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,319
套一圈绳索在它项上
close enough to slip a noose around its neck...

317
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,079
可只要一步走错  满盘皆输
...but one false move and it's game over.

318
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:26,089
最终鲨鱼上钩了
Finally it takes the bait.

319
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,519
他耐心准备着套索
Slowly he prepares the noose.

320
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:55,749
布莱斯无法把持住不停扭动的鲨鱼
Blais can't keep hold of the thrashing shark,

321
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:58,589
但这个木浮却可以防止鲨鱼潜入水中
but this wooden float prevents it diving.

322
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,649
随后  就像中了咒语一般
Then, as if under a spell,

323
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,069
鲨鱼突然静止不动了
the shark suddenly stops.

324
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:33,949
事实上是木浮利用了鲨鱼生理上的特点
But in fact the float exploits a quirk in shark biology,

325
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:36,219
使它精疲力尽
exhausting it so much,

326
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:39,829
进入了紧张性僵直的状态
it enters a state known as tonic immobility.

327
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:44,669
布莱斯小心翼翼地接近鲨鱼
Blais approaches with caution.

328
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,049
此时的鲨鱼还有很强的生命力
The shark is still very much alive

329
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,829
它的撕咬仍能造成致命的伤害
and its bite could cause serious injury.

330
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:07,419
以往  布莱斯会杀了鲨鱼作为食物
In the past, Blais would have killed the shark for food.

331
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:12,189
但今天他放了它
But today he lets it go free.

332
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,139
布莱斯致力于
Blais is committed to

333
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,229
保护召唤鲨鱼的文化
keeping his shark-calling culture alive...

334
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,109
这也意味着要挽救鲨鱼的生命
...and this means keeping sharks alive.

335
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,809
现在鲨鱼数量

336
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,809
急剧减少

337
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,789
我很担心...

338
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,479
...我们的子孙后代

339
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:42,929
没有鲨鱼

340
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,929
我们的生活也会随之消亡

341
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:47,259
其实不仅仅是传统文化正饱受威胁
And it's not just traditions that are threatened.

342
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:51,709
在很多海域
In some seas around the world,

343
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,349
鱼类数量的持续下降
a growing shortage of fish

344
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,349
迫使人们越潜越深
is forcing people deeper and deeper,

345
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,969
只为一次可观的打捞
just to land a decent catch.

346
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:04,109
深到他们不得不冒险挑战人类极限
So deep, they venture to the very limits of human survival.

347
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:13,049
欢迎来到帕阿林潜水者的世界
Welcome to the world of the Pa-aling divers,

348
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,119
这也许是最危险的捕鱼方式
perhaps the most dangerous fishing method of all.

349
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:21,069
这八十个人里  大部分都是少年
80 men, many of whom are still teenagers,

350
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,389
他们准备好了要潜至40多米之深
are preparing to dive to over 40 metres,

351
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:28,109
通过这简陋的空气管将就着呼吸
breathing air pumped through these makeshift tubes

352
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,539
那生锈的空气压缩机压出的空气
by this rusty compressor.

353
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,989
约瑟芬是最年轻出海人之一
Joseph is one of the youngest aboard,

354
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:37,509
但他却很清楚可能的危险
but he's aware of the risks.

355
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:42,689
用压缩机潜水

356
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:42,689
是很危险的

357
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:48,149
他目睹过这份工作中存在着的致命危险
He's already witnessed just how lethal his job can be.

358
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:53,439
我一个很亲密的

359
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,439
伙伴死了...

360
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,119
我们试图抢救他  但失败了

361
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,429
他说想

362
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:02,429
休息一会...

363
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,829
没想到却是

364
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,829
永别

365
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:09,869
菲律宾海域曾海产丰富
The seas around the Philippines were once rich with life,

366
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,539
但由于过度开发
but they've been so over-exploited

367
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,649
要获得丰收就要下潜到危险的深度
that decent fish numbers are only found at perilous depths.

368
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,919
渔网聚成了一个巨大的球体
The divers guide the huge ball of nets

369
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,149
由潜水员带至40米深处的海床
40 metres down to the sea floor,

370
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,549
但他们的氧气供给始终存在着危险
but all the while their air supply is at risk.

371
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:43,279
回到船上
Back on the boat,

372
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,779
破烂的压缩机和每况愈下的空气管
the ailing compressor and the ever-worsening tangle of tubes

373
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:49,009
需要随时监控
need constant attention.

374
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,109
正如衰弱的心脏给阻塞的动脉泵血一般
Like a failing heart pumping through clogged arteries,

375
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:57,349
如果循环系统受阻
if this circulation system fails,

376
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:01,429
潜至如此深度  就几乎意味着死亡
at this depth, it's almost certain death.

377
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,429
约瑟芬和队友解开了渔网
Joseph and the team unravel the nets

378
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:13,069
并将它们系牢在石头上
and lay them out by securing them to rocks.

379
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,869
他们必须速战速决
They must work fast.

380
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,999
约瑟芬清楚  在如此深度待得越久
Joseph knows, the longer he spends at these depths,

381
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:33,899
处境就越危险
the more dangerous it becomes.

382
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,829
每呼吸一次  就会有更多氮气进入体内
With every breath, more nitrogen dissolves in his body,

383
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:40,439
使身体更易受到减压病的侵害
making him increasingly vulnerable to decompression sickness

384
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,279
即潜水病
"the bends".

385
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,669
网的顶端悬浮着注满空气的塑料容器
The top of the net is suspended by plastic containers filled with air,

386
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:10,309
在下方形成了一个巨大的孔状陷阱
creating a huge cavernous trap beneath.

387
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,709
现在该布下惊吓线了
Now it's time to set the scare line.

388
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,729
船拖着长达千米的惊吓线
The boats drag the 1,000-metre line

389
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:37,589
围着网布成了一个巨大的圈
to form a huge circle around the net,

390
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:40,799
潜水者则沿着线分布
and the divers position themselves along it.

391
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,049
约瑟芬和队友们向渔网游去
Joseph and the team begin closing the trap

392
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:48,019
开始收紧陷阱
by swimming towards the net.

393
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:52,509
涌动的水流和上升的水帘
The waving streamers and the curtain of rising bubbles

394
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,189
惊散了鱼儿
panics the fish and they flee.

395
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,759
随着潜水者们逐步将线收紧
As the line of divers tightens,

396
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:08,409
越来越多的鱼向上游入了张开的渔网
more and more fish swim straight into the gaping net.

397
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,779
这种深海围鱼法十分有效
This deep-sea round-up is so effective,

398
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:20,019
能捕到礁带范围内的半数鱼儿
it can take 50% of the fish from a reef.

399
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,589
网已经收了
The net is closed,

400
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,019
现在约瑟芬要去做一件更危险的事
and now Joseph must do something even more dangerous,

401
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,869
进入网中将鱼们赶入网的深处
get inside and herd the catch to the far end.

402
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:51,479
如果你在网中

403
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:51,479
失去氧气供给或被缠住了...

404
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:57,139
...你肯定就

405
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,139
死那儿了

406
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:08,069
船上  互相缠绕的空气管情况更糟了
On deck, the tangled web of tubes is getting worse.

407
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:28,279
一旦集中了鱼群
Once the catch is concentrated,

408
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:31,459
他们就会将网从固定点松开
the net is released from its anchor points.

409
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:40,429
现在到了最危险的步骤
Now comes the most lethal stage of all-

410
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:43,909
牵着网浮至水面
guiding the net as it shoots to the surface.

411
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:48,629
经常有潜水员因上升太快而得了潜水病
All too often, the divers ascend too quickly and get the bends.

412
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:12,469
战利品已成功拉上船  成果也可见一斑
As the catch is hauled onto the boat, its size is revealed.

413
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:17,549
一吨左右的鱼量不算太差
Just under a tonne of fish isn't bad

414
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:22,129
但离几年前的收成还差得远
but it's nowhere near what these fishermen were landing a few years ago.

415
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,829
而且这不是唯一的问题
And this isn't the only problem.

416
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:28,869
有些队员已经患上了潜水病
Some of the crew do have the bends.

417
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,989
一名潜水员不得不回到海底以缓解症状
One diver has returned to the bottom to relieve the symptoms,

418
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,509
同时  离水面更近的地方  另一名
whilst, closer to the surface, another is

419
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:40,509
正接受按摩以缓解脊梁上作痛的水泡
massaged to release the painful bubbles in his spine.

420
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,629
每天  这些潜水员们
Every day, these Pa-aling divers

421
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:51,629
都为日益变少的回报承受着剧增的风险
are taking greater risks for dwindling rewards.

422
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:58,099
我也许能找些别的工作...

423
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:04,109
...安全的工作

424
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:09,469
...不会伤害

425
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,469
身体的工作

426
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:14,159
约瑟芬有一个梦想
Joseph has his dreams,

427
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,219
但是现实是残酷的
but the harsh reality is

428
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:20,579
为了糊口他今天必须再下潜两次
he'll be diving twice again today just to make ends meet.

429
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:25,809
我们在海洋上取得了巨大成功
We've become so successful in the ocean

430
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,919
曾有人预言在五十年内
it's predicted that in 50 years

431
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:30,399
所有的鱼将消失殆尽
almost all the fish could be gone...

432
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:37,349
而这可能并不是唯一的变数
..and this may not be the only change to come.

433
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,109
全世界的海平面都在上升
All around the world, sea levels are rising.

434
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:46,949
用不了多久海洋将成为我们星球的主宰
Soon our planet could be even more dominated by the ocean,

435
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:49,149
我们在地球上的求生之道
and our ability to survive here

436
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:51,339
也将被逼至极限
will be pushed to the very limit.

437
00:40:58,629 --> 00:41:00,429
但有些人
Yet there are some people

438
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,979
已经适应了水上的生活
who've already adapted to life in a water world.

439
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:13,869
在婆罗洲  苏拉威西岛与菲律宾之间的珊瑚海中
In the coral seas between Borneo, Sulawesi and the Philippines,

440
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:16,809
有些人的生存方式
there are people who live more intimately with the ocean

441
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:20,269
比世上任何一个种群更亲近海洋
than any other culture on earth.

442
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:33,309
巴乔村的人居住在海面上
The Bajau Laut build their lives in the middle of the sea,

443
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:36,429
而且通常离海岸有数公里的距离
often many kilometres from land.

444
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:49,779
海洋对他们生活的方方面面
The ocean has a profound influence

445
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:52,309
都有着深远的影响
on every aspect of their existence.

446
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,569
他们甚至通过潮汐的节奏
They even measure the passage of time

447
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,049
来得知时间的流逝
by the rhythm of the tides

448
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:58,429
而不是传统的分分秒秒
rather than minutes and hours.

449
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:11,309
还有一些人与海洋的渊源则更深
And there are some whose relationship with the sea runs even deeper.

450
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:23,269
住在船屋上的巴乔村民们
The Bajau, who live on houseboats,

451
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:27,109
则完全切断了他们与陆地的联系
have almost completely severed their ties with the land.

452
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:35,149
诺哈拉很少踏上陆地
Nohara rarely sets foot ashore.

453
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,269
我在船上出生...

454
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:44,139
一生都在海上

455
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:49,619
我喜欢船上的生活...

456
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:53,169
因为这样我们

457
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,169
想去哪儿就去哪儿

458
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:58,299
我们可以远航觅食...

459
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,639
也可以远离烦恼

460
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:06,159
诺哈拉一家通常只有在买粮食燃料
Nohara and her family usually only visit land

461
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,619
或船需要维修时
to trade for rice and fuel,

462
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,659
才会踏上陆地
or to mend their boats.

463
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:14,789
但像很多巴乔人一样  诺哈拉"晕陆"
But, like many Bajau, Nohara gets "land-sick"

464
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:17,819
因此她宁愿待在船上
and she prefers to stay aboard.

465
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:21,499
她的家庭没有国籍
Her family has no nationality,

466
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:24,389
没有固定的停留之处  也几乎一穷二白
no fixed abode and almost no money,

467
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:27,949
但海洋给了他们所需的一切
but the ocean provides everything they need.

468
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:34,229
他们可以食用一系列让人眼花缭乱的海产
They eat a bewildering variety of seafood.

469
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:46,269
她的孩子们很小就适应了水上的生活
Her children adapt to an aquatic way of life from a very young age.

470
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:54,529
一些巴乔的孩子们经常待在海里
Some Bajau children spend so much time in the sea,

471
00:43:54,529 --> 00:43:58,599
他们的眼睛更适应水下视物
their eyes adjust to focus better underwater.

472
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,649
但这个群体中有名成员
But there's one member of this community

473
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:05,819
他的适应力令人称奇
whose adaptation is even more staggering.

474
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,829
瑟宾是一名水下猎人
Sulbin is an underwater hunter,

475
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:16,669
他是人类能在水下生存之极限
and the living proof of just how far we can push our bodies

476
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:18,469
活生生的例子
towards a life aquatic.

477
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:29,199
我潜水时

478
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,199
感觉很放松...

479
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:36,089
下了海里就像回了家...

480
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,929
感觉和在陆地上差不多

481
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:43,639
瑟宾在为晚餐寻找食物
Sulbin's search for supper

482
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,149
他开始了一段穿梭于海浪尖的神奇之旅
takes him on an incredible journey under the waves,

483
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:51,109
他的能力绝对会让你目瞪口呆
and his abilities will take your breath away.

484
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,439
他以近乎神游的状态开始准备
First he prepares by entering a trance-like state.

485
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:08,259
下水之前
我必须将心思集中在呼吸上

486
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,379
我只在完全放松的情况下潜水

487
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,289
瑟宾即将让身体
Sulbin is about to push his body

488
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:26,119
超越极限
almost beyond the realms of possibility,

489
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,259
如果你想和他一起试试
and if you want to try and join him,

490
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:32,179
那就准备屏住呼吸  越久越好
get ready to hold your breath for as long as you can.

491
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,869
他吸入了最后一口气
He takes one last breath.

492
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,489
他全神贯注  心如止水
Focused and calm,

493
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:07,729
潜入了20米深的海底
sulbin descends 20 metres to the sea floor.

494
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:22,349
他的心跳缓至每分钟30下
His heartbeat slows to around 30 beats per minute.

495
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:26,949
此深度的压力使他的胸膛受到压迫
The pressure at these depths crushes his chest,

496
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:31,749
将肺部容量挤至平时的三分之一
squeezing the air in his lungs to one-third of its usual volume,

497
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,269
即使没有负重
Even without weights,

498
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:39,049
他也无法像在陆地上一样
he's negatively buoyant enough

499
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:43,149
大步横穿海底  轻松捕猎
to stride across the bottom of the sea as if hunting on land.

500
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:03,969
现在他血液中的二氧化碳
By now, the carbon dioxide in his blood causes

501
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:07,549
唤起了一股几乎无法抗拒的对呼吸的渴望
an almost irresistible urge to gasp for air,

502
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:11,669
但瑟宾必须把精力集中在捕猎上
but Sulbin must keep his mind on the hunt.

503
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:23,459
1分45秒后
After a minute and three-quarters,

504
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:26,109
瑟宾发现了一条鱼
Sulbin spots a fish.

505
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,869
瑟宾可以比这次潜得更深
Sulbin can go even deeper than this

506
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,449
并在水下停留5分钟
and stay down for up to five minutes,

507
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,179
但他不需要那样卖弄
but he's not one to show off

508
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:50,119
毕竟  他已达到了此行的目的
and, after all, he's got what he came for.

509
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:58,109
靠着一口气在压力下潜水长达两分半之久
Two-and-a-half minutes of hunting under pressure on one breath.

510
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:01,839
也许人类从海洋哺乳动物进化而来的说法
Perhaps the idea of humans existing as marine mammals

511
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,109
并非那么离谱
is not so far-fetched after all.

512
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:19,509
通过惊人的努力与适应力
Through amazing adaptability and endeavour,

513
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:23,029
我们将自身的海洋生存能力推向更高的极限
we've pushed our limits of survival into the ocean

514
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:26,949
我们在这幽深的世界潜得愈来愈深
and, as we've immersed ourselves deeper in the sea,

515
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:30,229
它对我们的生活也起了深远的影响
it's had a profound effect on our lives.

516
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:38,009
但随着我们不断改变着
But as we continue to change

517
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:41,649
地球大环境的本态
the nature of the greatest environment on our planet,

518
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:47,059
未来我们将如何适应  还得静观其变
how we'll adapt in the future remains to be seen.

519
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:54,519
人类星球

520
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:54,519
镜头背后的故事

521
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,539
在人类星球之海洋节目中
The most technical and demanding shoots

522
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,989
最有技术含量且最耗时耗力的镜头
for the Human Planet: Oceans programme

523
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:05,789
是那些在水下拍摄的片段
were those that took place underwater.

524
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,589
水下摄像团队已为拍摄菲律宾渔民
The dive camera crew were well prepared

525
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:12,199
做好了充足的准备
to film fishermen in the Philippines.

526
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,889
但他们对可能面临的危险
But they weren't quite prepared

527
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,309
并无防备
for the dangers they witnessed

528
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:18,869
也未曾料到友谊的桥梁会从此建起
and the friendships they'd forge.

529
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:24,429
巴拉望岛  菲律宾
北纬11度11分9秒  西经119度23分44秒

530
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:24,389
厘米纳科岛是80位深海捕鱼渔民的家乡
Liminangcong is home to the 80

531
00:49:24,389 --> 00:49:27,389
摄像团队将跟随帕阿林潜水员进行拍摄
Pa-aling fishermen that the film crew will follow.

532
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:32,699
这是西蒙  这是罗杰...

533
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,749
他们将潜到水下

534
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:38,149
会和你们一同潜水...

535
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:41,609
并将在水下进行拍摄

536
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:46,439
两艘渔船上  挤满了80名潜水员
Two fishing boats are crammed with 80 divers,

537
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,989
以及他们的口粮和储备物资
their food and provisions,

538
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,539
这些都是为两周的出海所做的准备
before heading out for two weeks at sea.

539
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:56,479
在捕鱼区
At the fishing grounds,

540
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,359
西蒙和罗杰在争分夺秒
Simon and Roger are playing catch-up,

541
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:00,469
因为穿戴潜水装备
as their technical underwater equipment

542
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,919
大大消耗了他们的时间
is slowing them down.

543
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:04,869
他们已经把绳子扔下去了  都没跟我们说
They've dropped the lines. They didn't even tell us.

544
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:07,149
罗杰・芒斯
潜水员/摄像师

545
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,549
船长今天好像要大干一番
The captain seems to be on a mission

546
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,389
一副志在必得的样子
to prove something today

547
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:09,689
所以我们得加快速度了
so we've got to go fast.

548
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:15,329
水下拍摄危机四伏
Underwater filming is risky,

549
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:19,059
但与用压缩机潜水的人们每天所遭遇的相比
but these risks are nothing compared to those faced daily

550
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,259
这些真是小巫见大巫
by the compressor divers.

551
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:27,479
压缩机潜水是极端危险的谋生手段
Compressor diving is a dangerous way to make a living.

552
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:32,389
这种常被柴油污染的空气
Air, often tainted with diesel,

553
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:33,939
通过细塑料管
is pumped through thin plastic tubes

554
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:36,519
直接被潜水员吸入体内
right down to the divers.

555
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,619
迪奥尼斯奥・杰宁・马丁尼托
压缩机潜水员

556
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,229
64岁的杰宁是船上一位经验丰富的潜水员
At 64, Joning is one of the veterans on the boat,

557
00:50:42,229 --> 00:50:45,469
他深知压缩机潜水的残酷
and knows the harsh realities of compressor diving.

558
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:50,159
我当压缩机潜水员已经有30年了

559
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,149
我15岁时...

560
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:57,639
就开始下海工作

561
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:01,899
大多数潜水员年轻体壮
Most of the divers are young and fit,

562
00:51:01,899 --> 00:51:03,269
他们也必须如此
and they need to be.

563
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,389
这是个极其耗费体力的工作
It's physically demanding work,

564
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,859
潜水员完全依靠压缩机
and the men are totally reliant on the compressor

565
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,799
维持呼吸
to keep them breathing.

566
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:18,029
如果你靠压缩机潜到海底

567
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:21,939
...机器功率稍有减弱

568
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,939
你就会缺氧...

569
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:25,779
...造成胸腔受损

570
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:27,989
说实话
To use, basically, what's essentially

571
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:30,069
用浇花园的水管下潜25米
a garden hose down at 25 metres,

572
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:32,499
还要把空气压缩进嘴里  真是太疯狂了
to pump air into your mouth, is just mad.

573
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:37,879
对这些渔民来说最大的危险
The biggest danger for these fishermen is known as

574
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:41,229
就是减压病  俗称"潜水病"
decompression sickness, or "the bends".

575
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:46,329
当潜水员长时间深潜
The bends can happen when divers have been down deep

576
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:47,789
而又出水过快时
for a long time,

577
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:50,589
就会得减压病
and then come up too quickly to the surface.

578
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:53,299
氮气会进入潜水员体内
Nitrogen is absorbed into the body

579
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:54,989
当他们上浮时
and, as the divers rise up,

580
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,999
各个关节处会形成气泡
bubbles are formed that can lodge in the joints,

581
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:00,329
造成剧烈的疼痛
causing intense pain.

582
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:06,629
有两名潜水员在这次深潜中深受其害
Two guys are in real trouble on this deep dive.

583
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:10,309
马丁  一名年轻的潜水员  疼痛难忍
Martin, a young diver, is in such pain

584
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:14,029
他朋友试图通过按摩来减轻他的病痛
that his friend tries to relieve it by massaging him.

585
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:19,469
等到浮出水面  大家都看得出
Once on the surface, it's obvious to everyone

586
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,909
马丁的情况仍未好转
that Martin is still in trouble.

587
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,919
如若不治疗
If not treated,

588
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:31,269
减压病会导致终生残疾  甚至是死亡
the bends can lead to permanent injuries and even death.

589
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:35,389
同时  另一名潜水员迈克尔
Meanwhile, the second diver,

590
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:38,109
同样遇到了麻烦
Michael, is also having problems.

591
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:41,229
看起来有两个人出现了减压症
It seems like two men just came up with the bends.

592
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:44,149
汤姆・休・琼斯
《人类星球》制片人

593
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:43,019
他们为了捕到更多的鱼
They went pretty deep on this dive,

594
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:44,149
潜得太深了
trying to get more fish.

595
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:46,029
我们已经把他们安置到船上
But we've taken them onto our boat

596
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,849
对他们实施急救
to get some medical attention

597
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:49,239
希望他们都没事
so, hopefully, they're all right.

598
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,749
西蒙设法用船员急救用品
Simon tries to relieve their symptoms

599
00:52:53,749 --> 00:52:55,709
帮助缓解他们的症状
with the crew's first aid supplies.

600
00:52:55,709 --> 00:52:57,189
再吸一次氧
One more.

601
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:59,549
迈克尔已经吸了15分钟氧气
Michael's had 15 minutes on oxygen.

602
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:03,149
现在让马丁再吸15分钟氧气
Now put Martin onto another set of 15 minutes.

603
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:05,409
西蒙・恩德比
潜水员/摄影师

604
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:05,019
这是
This is the...you know,

605
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,639
我们目前能提供的
the rudimentary decompression first aid

606
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,979
最基本的减压急救措施  让他们吸氧
we can give them at the moment- give them oxygen,

607
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,959
给他们补水并让他们保暖
give them water to rehydrate and keep them warm.

608
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:14,269
他们都表示
Both of them are saying that

609
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:16,349
症状有所减轻
their symptoms are decreasing

610
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:17,679
他们看起来比半小时前
and they are looking a lot more happy

611
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,119
精神了一些
than they did about half an hour ago.

612
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:22,519
他让他们吸更多氧气
He gives them oxygen,

613
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,979
以帮助降低体内氮气含量
which helps reduce the nitrogen in their bodies

614
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:26,539
减轻他们的痛苦
and relieves their pain,

615
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:29,669
但即使是这种最基本的潜水急救措施
but even this most basic of diving first aid

616
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:32,989
对于帕阿林渔民来说  都是可望而不可及的
is not normally available to the Pa-aling fishermen.

617
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,459
不疼了吗
No pain?

618
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:38,219
在菲律宾  渔民属于低收入人群
This isn't surprising as the fishermen in the Philippines

619
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:41,039
一周仅有25美元的收入
belong to the lowest wage earners in the country,

620
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,629
这样的情况不足为奇
earning about 25 US dollars for a week's work.

621
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:49,259
然而  对于许多像杰宁家一样的渔民来说
However, for many, like Joning and his family,

622
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,399
这是生活唯一的出路
this is their whole way of life.

623
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:57,409
我的三个儿子和一个孙子

624
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:57,409
参加了这次出海任务

625
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:01,269
我经常提醒儿子们要小心...

626
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:08,099
大儿子要依靠压缩机...

627
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:12,599
在36米的深度
待上4个小时

628
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:15,939
当他上浮时...

629
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:19,659
气泡袭击了他的身体

630
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:24,759
他儿子得了减压病
His son had got the bends,

631
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:27,189
现在要借助拐杖行走
and now has to use crutches.

632
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,439
但这并不是唯一一次
But this isn't the only time

633
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:32,169
压缩机潜水的魔爪
the dangers of compressor diving

634
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,779
伸向杰宁一家
have hit Joning's family.

635
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:39,849
我二儿子在一次潜水后瘫痪了

636
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:43,309
他无法接受这个事实...

637
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:46,209
他很想好起来

638
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:51,379
我费尽心力
想找个人给他治病...

639
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:53,499
...但缺钱

640
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:56,689
将近一年后...

641
00:54:56,689 --> 00:55:00,969
我们也无能为力了...

642
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:03,419
我的儿子  悲痛欲绝之际...

643
00:55:03,419 --> 00:55:06,769
决定上吊自杀

644
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,629
节哀顺变
I'm very sorry about that.

645
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:13,519
太悲剧了
Yeah. That's terrible.

646
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,329
这让你...很难过吧
That's really...That's really sad, isn't it?

647
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:19,039
是的
It is.

648
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:30,179
与压缩机潜水员
Having spent a week

649
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:32,669
工作生活了一周之后
living and working with the compressor divers,

650
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:36,709
西蒙和罗杰与这些渔民成为了朋友
Simon and Roger have become very close to the fishermen.

651
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:40,999
为了充分了解他们的生活方式
To fully understand their way of life,

652
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:43,259
西蒙要亲身体验
Simon needed to experience first-hand

653
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:45,969
做一名压缩机潜水员
what it's like to be a compressor diver.

654
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:52,649
杰宁很乐意带他进行一次浅层潜水
So Joning is keen to take him on a shallow dive.

655
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,949
我看他们这么做过  看起来很容易
I've seen the boys do it. They've made it look easy.

656
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:59,679
但已经有好几个人
But we've had several guys that

657
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,389
出现了减压病的症状
have gone down with symptoms of the bends.

658
00:56:02,389 --> 00:56:03,109
不得不承认
I've got to admit that

659
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,979
我有点虚
I'm feeling a little bit apprehensive.

660
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:13,089
西蒙有16年的水肺潜水经验
Simon has scuba-dived for 16 years

661
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:15,169
超过3000次的潜水经历
and has logged over 3,000 dives,

662
00:56:15,169 --> 00:56:18,739
而这却是最回归原始的一次潜水
but this is diving at its most basic.

663
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:29,149
一分钟左右  我被送下水
About the first minute, I got sent out,

664
00:56:29,149 --> 00:56:32,589
说真的  我有点吓呆了
I was, er...a little bit petrified, actually.

665
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,479
这玩意太猛了
This is a violent thing.

666
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:37,249
空气直接往喉咙里灌
It's just punching air down your throat.

667
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:38,279
真是太疯狂了
It's quite mad.

668
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:41,069
我花了一分钟来控制身体平衡
It took me a minute to kind of get myself under control

669
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,269
一旦你摸到了诀窍
and then once you've got the hang of it,

670
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:44,969
并充分信赖起这套装置
and once you believe in it and trust in it,

671
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,869
就能继续游了
then you can swim on.

672
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:08,529
有好几次送气管从嘴里掉出来时
There were a couple of times when I lost it, though.

673
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:09,869
我一阵挣扎
I was flailing around everywhere.

674
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:12,869
想把它抓住塞回嘴里
I was trying to find it again and get it back in.

675
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:16,979
虽然杰宁一直密切关注着我
But Joning was keeping a good eye on me,

676
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:18,419
其他人也是如此
and the rest of the guys were as well,

677
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:20,749
但我可不希望整个捕鱼过程中
but I wouldn't want to do that

678
00:57:20,759 --> 00:57:23,599
都得这样潜水
for a whole fish-catching session

679
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,429
这一点是肯定的
that's for sure.

680
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:30,829
潜水员之间建立了深厚的友谊
A strong camaraderie between the divers has been forged.

681
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:34,229
摄像团队抓拍到了这感人至深的一幕
The film crew have captured a dramatic sequence,

682
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:36,299
渔民们满载而归
and the fishermen head home happy,

683
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,479
可以高兴地回家了
with a boatload of fish to sell.

684
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:44,919
当你和大家打成一片时...

685
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,569
你会觉得船上的生活格外美妙

686
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:53,309
如果收获颇丰...

687
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:57,019
大家都会很开心

688
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:59,949
杰宁和船上一行人
Joning and everyone on board

689
00:57:59,949 --> 00:58:02,589
又完成了一次深海捕鱼行动
have finished another Pa-aling fishing trip,

690
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:06,459
大家都能开心平安地回到家人身边了
and all can return safe and sound to their families.
