第八集

15
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,280
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved

16
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,770
在地球的每一个角落都留下了印迹
a life for itself in every habitat on Earth.

17
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,680
那就是人类
That creature is us.

18
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,770
天地悠悠
All over the world, we still

19
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,410
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

20
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,070
远离文明开化的城市  
far from the city lights, 

21
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,900
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,740
苍茫大地之上
In all the wild places on earth,

23
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,580
挑战不断袭来  人类则越挫越勇
we have risen to the challenges nature has thrown at us.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,060
怡然之居已然拔地而起
Now we have created the habitat of our dreams.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,100
由己所建  为己所用
Designed by us, for us.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,790
这达到了人类想象力和创造力的顶峰
The pinnacle of human imagination and ingenuity.

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,290
这一切让我们认为  人类就是地球的主宰
This is where we humans like to think we reign supreme,

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,190
驱逐不喜之物
driving out the nature we don't want...

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,090
真恶心
Oh, God!

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,410
运输所需之物
...shipping in what we do.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,650
但是  自然不易掌控
But the natural world isn't easy to control.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,360
人类能否真正在都市丛林中掌控自然
Can we humans ever really master nature in the urban jungle?

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,620
况且  这一做法明智吗
And is it wise to try?

34
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:59,530
城市

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,530
都市丛林求生记

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,110
迪拜是极度现代化的城市
Dubai is the ultimate modern city,

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,470
井然有序  熠熠发光  纤尘不染
orderly, sparkling and squeaky clean.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,230
这是人类智慧的结晶  
It's a temple to man's ingenuity, 

39
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,550
是冉冉升起的沙漠之星
rising from the desert.

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,290
但是这里存在高空威胁
But there's a menace in the air. 

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,830
鸽子
Pigeons.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,650
无数只鸽子给这座清新的城市带来污秽
Thousands of them are making a mess in this pristine metropolis,

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,110
因此迪拜人不喜欢鸽子
and Dubai doesn't like it.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,970
有个人能够提供帮助
One man can help.

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,420
阿拉伯人称他为阿尔赫
The Arabs call him Al Hurr.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,600
他的名字叫大卫・斯塔德
His name is David Stead.

47
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,080
好孩子
Good lad.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,330
他用猎鹰将鸽群赶出迪拜
His challenge is to keep Dubai pigeon free using falcons

49
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,130
用一种古阿拉伯方法解决现代都市问题
an ancient Arabian solution for a modern urban problem.

50
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,880
食肉鸟肯定会以鸟类为食
Birds of prey, of course, are hunting birds.

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,640
而猎鹰则是食肉鸟家族的一员
And the falcons, in the bird of prey family,

52
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,920
还是其中的高手
are the specialist bird-hunters.

53
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,280
它们靠捕食其他鸟类为生
They only catch other birds for a living.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,320
所以  和其他食肉鸟相比
And, as a result, the pigeons are most scared of falcons,

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,310
猎鹰是鸽子最大的天敌
compared to any of the other birds of prey. 

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,460
哪怕从未见过猎鹰的鸽子 
So, even a pigeon that has never seen a falcon in its life 

57
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,740
对类似猎鹰的轮廓外形
does have this almost genetic fear of the silhouette- 

58
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,610
也有着天生的恐惧感
the shape- of a falcon.

59
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,290
今天  他和猎鹰尼墨一起
Today, he is working for some of Dubai's top hotels

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,060
为迪拜的顶级酒店驱赶鸽子
with his peregrine falcon Nimr. 

61
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,800
尼墨现在有三岁了
Nimr is a three-year-old falcon now.

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,350
猎鹰一岁便已成年
They become adult at one.

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,090
她现在已经是相当成熟的猎鹰了
So she's now quite a mature falcon

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,730
尽管三岁  她还是有很多东西要学
although, at three, she still has an awful lot to learn.

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,150
整个猎鹰群中  她可能是最自负的一只
Out of the whole team, she's probably the most arrogant.

66
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,440
她有着强烈的野心
She has this tremendous attitude about her

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,150
知道谁在掌控一切
and she knows who's in charge.

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,150
我发誓  绝不是我们在掌控
And, I can assure you, it's not us.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,020
城里的鸽子大肆毁坏着这些建筑
City pigeons damage these buildings.

70
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,370
它们的排泄物具有腐蚀性  
Their corrosive droppings 

71
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,990
会侵蚀铬合金和石材
erode chrome and stone,

72
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,880
每只鸽子每年产生十二公斤的排泄物
and each bird can produce 12 kilos of mess a year.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,260
大卫并不是要杀死或捉住它们
But David's aim isn't to kill or even catch them.

74
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,720
他只希望将它们吓走
He is hoping to scare them away.

75
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,730
尼墨喜欢追逐游戏
And Nimr loves the chase.

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,620
但她毕竟是一只猎鹰
After all, she's a peregrine -

77
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,860
广袤天界中速度最快的生物
the fastest creature in the sky,

78
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,930
时速可达二百八十公里
capable of swooping at 280 kilometres an hour.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,670
所以一旦她将鸽子赶走  大卫便将她唤回
So, once she's moved them on, he needs to tempt her back.

80
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,510
这是需要技巧的
And that's tricky.

81
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,190
她是只好奇心极强的猎鹰
She's an extremely inquisitive falcon,

82
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,030
这让我很崩溃  
which can be frustrating for me, 

83
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,140
因为当她飞走并看到有趣事物的时候
because I tend to lose all contact and control with her

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,980
很有可能会与我失去联系并失控
when she's flying and she sees something amusing.

85
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,410
但是总有一个赢得猎鹰芳心的方法
But there's always one way to a falcon's heart

86
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,980
那就是奖励她一顿鸡肉大餐
the promise of a chicken dinner.

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,490
由于大卫和尼墨的帮助  
Thanks to David and Nimr, 

88
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,870
迪拜的酒店远离了鸽子的困扰
Dubai's hotels remain pigeon free.

89
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,230
毕竟  没人想让鸽子粪毁了百万美元的美景
After all, no-one wants pigeon poo to spoil their million-dollar view.

90
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,630
有时候  将不受欢迎的野生动物赶出城
Sometimes, driving unwanted wildlife out of a town

91
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,710
需要更加现代的手段
requires a much more modern solution.

92
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,660
疯狂的麋鹿  精美野外家装饰品

93
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,160
斯坦・舒马克警官外出执勤
Sergeant Stan Schumaker is on a mission.

94
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,240
他就职于科罗拉多州的埃斯蒂斯公园
He works in Estes Park, Colorado.

95
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,250
每天他都开着一辆特殊警车外出巡逻
Every day he patrols his patch on an unusual police vehicle

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,210
一辆赛格威电动滑板车
a Segway scooter.

97
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,020
埃尔克霍恩大街

98
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,030
他的工作是保证街道畅通
His job is to keep the streets free of trouble.

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,650
此地区的麻烦很大且难以攻克
And trouble here is particularly large and spiky.

100
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,370
一旦麋鹿进入马路  整个城镇就一片混乱
Once the elk come in, getting around town's a hassle, 

101
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,370
尤其是六月到十月初
pretty much from June to the beginning of October.

102
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,620
每年夏天  麋鹿都会侵扰这里
Every summer, the town is invaded by elk stags.

103
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,350
舒马克警官的工作就是确保当地居民的
Sergeant Schumaker's job is to make sure that the locals

104
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,840
日常生活不受影响
can go about their daily business.

105
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,100
一年中的这个时候可不好过
Not easy at this time of year.

106
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,710
麋鹿看起来很温顺
They may look placid,

107
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,780
但它们重达三百多公斤  高达三米
but elk weigh over 300 kilos, can be three metres tall

108
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,330
再加上有致命危险的鹿角
and their antlers are lethal.

109
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,910
城里到处可见它们的身影
They're pretty much everywhere in town.

110
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,200
整个山谷满是麋鹿  
This whole valley is pretty much full of elk. 

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,140
任一时间地点  数量都有五百到一千五
At any given time, there could be anywhere from 500 to 1,500.

112
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,220
雌性麋鹿对城市绿地偏爱有加
The female elk love the urban grasslands.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,480
它们终年生活于此
They live here year round.

114
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,950
我们有两个大型高尔夫球场
We've got two main golf courses.

115
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,970
这里的草地是为打高尔夫球准备的  
The grass is, of course, golf grass, 

116
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,390
它们显然偏爱于此
so they absolutely love that.

117
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,400
雄性麋鹿们只是来逛逛
The male elk are only visiting.

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,340
并不是为了看高尔夫球赛
And it's not for golf.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,860
它们回到城里就为了一件事
The boys are back in town for one thing

120
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,710
"求偶大对决"
a stag party.

121
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,830
每年这个时候
At this time of year,

122
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,880
雄鹿为争夺雌性进行决斗  这很危险
the stags fight over the females and can be very dangerous.

123
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,330
但是制造麻烦的还不仅仅是麋鹿们
But it's not just the elk causing problems.

124
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,840
舒马克警官还要疏散游客
Sergeant Schumaker also has to control the tourists.

125
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,630
绝大部分游客不知道这些动物是野生的
A lot of these tourists have no idea that these animals are wild.

126
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,820
这很荒唐  但是他们的确
It's the craziest thing, but they

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,760
认为这些动物已被驯化
for some reason they think these animals are tame.

128
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,070
游客中心
通行信息

129
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,560
没有比让一头发怒的麋鹿追逐更糟糕的了
There's no messing with an irritable elk.

130
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,990
危险
请勿靠近野生动物

131
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,030
回来
Get back, guys.

132
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,020
在二十一世纪的西部荒原
In the Wild West of the 21st century,

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,140
警官骑的白头大马换成了大型滑板车
the sheriffs white stallion has been replaced by a giant scooter.

134
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,280
麋鹿不喜欢赛格威车  我也不知道原因
The elk do not like the Segway. I don't know what it is.

135
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,050
我想是因为车的移动很特别
I think it's the movement,

136
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,840
因为这不是像正常人走路那样移动
because I'm not moving normal, as a human would walk.

137
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,950
开着赛格威车我会移动得很快
And I'm scurrying around a lot quicker on that Segway.

138
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,570
所以麋鹿不喜欢
So the elk do not like it whatsoever.

139
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,090
舒马克警官今天执勤很顺利
Today's been a good day for Sergeant Schumaker.

140
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,830
他把这个城镇的捣乱者都赶走了
He's run the troublemakers out of town.

141
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,870
但并不是所有的城市入侵者
But not all the invaders who

142
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,340
都这么容易被驱赶
come to our cities are so easy to chase away.

143
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,690
有些城市被一些狡黠
Some cities are plagued by creatures

144
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,680
和有生存技巧的生物所折磨
who are just as wily and streetwise as us.

145
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,330
斋浦尔  印度发展最快的城市之一
Jaipur, one of the fastest growing cities in India.

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,280
在这里  抢劫和小偷小摸屡见不鲜
Here, muggings and petty theft are part of everyday life.

147
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,890
夏康塔是当地集市的一个小贩  
Shakuntla, a local market seller, 

148
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,380
遭到街头暴徒的恐吓
is terrorised by street gangs.

149
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,030
但这些暴徒并不是当地的混混
And these are not the local lads.

150
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,380
它们不怕任何人

151
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:42,150
非常好斗  我们都怕它们

152
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,190
她每天都要面对它们
She has to face them every day.

153
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,650
那是一群可怕的动物
They're a terrifying bunch.

154
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,490
一小群恒河猴在屋顶上走来走去
A posse of rhesus macaques hang out on the rooftops.

155
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,760
若被它们的尖齿咬伤  后果非常严重
One bite from these canines can inflict horrible damage.

156
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,810
有一次  猴子们袭击一名妇女

157
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,310
最后只能去医院处理伤口

158
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,410
不知道她是否还活着

159
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,610
对于恒河猴来说  都市丛林里的生活甚至比
For the macaques, life in the urban jungle is even easier

160
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,530
在真正丛林里还要安逸
than life in the real one.

161
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,910
像我们一样  它们既聪明又老练
Like us, they can be smart and slick.

162
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,840
斋浦尔的寺庙和街道
Jaipur's temples and streets 

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,510
为它们提供了偷窃的温床
provide endless pockets to pick.

164
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,190
而它们最爱的地方还是食品市场
And their favourite place is the food market.

165
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,920
今天  夏康塔的货摊
The question today is, will Shakuntla's stall

166
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
能否免遭猴子们的毒手呢
survive all the monkey business?

167
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,640
这次攻击由帮派老大率领  一只体壮的公猴
The attack is led by the gang leader, an alpha male.

168
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,040
恒河猴们的作战都是团队协作
The macaques work as a co-ordinated team,

169
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,960
声东击西
ducking and diving.

170
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,550
从多方位进行偷袭
Attacking from all angles,

171
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,500
小恒河猴分散夏康塔的注意力
the smaller macaques distract Shakuntla,

172
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,040
胆大的公猴大肆抢夺
while the bolder males grab the loot.

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,310
斋浦尔街道的生活可谓艰辛
Life on Jaipur's streets is tough enough.

174
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,700
但是当你的对手被神灵护佑时
But when your enemy is protected by a deity,

175
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,560
那就无计可施了
there's nothing you can do.

176
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,100
这些猴子是猴神哈努曼的化身
These monkeys are sacred to the monkey god Hanuman.

177
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,790
哈努曼是我们的神

178
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,350
而这些猴子是他的化身

179
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,260
是他授意它们来吃喝的

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,980
而我只能空手而归

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,820
猴子成为了集市上的一大威胁
Monkeys can be a menace in the market.

182
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,440
城市大道之下正在进行着大规模战役
But there is a wider war going on under all our city streets.

183
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,720
有些物种已经开始威胁
Some species have become a threat to our domination

184
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,530
人类对都市丛林的统治地位
of our very own urban world.

185
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,570
杰夫和朱尼尔正在巡街
Jeff and Junior are on a stakeout,

186
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,090
在曼哈顿的街头追捕人类的死敌
hunting down mortal enemies on the Manhattan front line.

187
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,320
我是纽约市的夜间灭虫专员
My job is a night-time exterminator in New York City.

188
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,860
上白班的同事们灭臭虫
Day-time guys where I work do bedbugs.

189
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,590
我们负责消灭餐馆里的老鼠和蟑螂
We just do rats, mice, roaches in restaurants.

190
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,380
你猜我们每天几点到这儿
What sort of time do you think we'll be getting up in this place?

191
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,580
不知道  据说是在午夜
I don't know. They said about midnight.

192
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,910
这里还没打烊
They're not closed yet.

193
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,420
我觉得告诉人们我的工作没什么问题
I mean, I don't really have a problem telling people what I do,

194
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,390
但是我们要尽力做到小心谨慎
but we try to be as discreet as possible,

195
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,960
就是因为不想让人们
just because I don't want people

196
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,300
以为他们在满是老鼠的地方吃饭
to think that they're eating in an area that's full of rats.

197
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,820
但是东村的老鼠很多  无法隐瞒身份
But East Village is full of them, so you can't hide that.

198
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,040
老鼠们也爱高级餐厅
Rats love fine dining too.

199
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,640
但是它们从不付小费
But they don't leave tips behind.

200
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,930
它们只会留下粪便和疾病
They leave excrement and disease.

201
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,270
没有人愿意承认纽约市面临着巨大的鼠患
No-one wants to admit that the Big Apple has a big rat problem,

202
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,340
所以杰夫和朱尼尔才要在夜晚工作
so Jeff and Junior only work at night.

203
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
垃圾是问题的源头
Trash is a big deal.

204
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,150
不讲卫生的人把垃圾扔在路边
Us being sloppy humans throwing trash out on the sidewalks,

205
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,440
喝剩的果汁
and leaving the juices and

206
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,210
肉汤  鸡骨头满地都是
meat juices and chicken bones everywhere.

207
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,130
知道吗  那对它们来说可是顿大餐
That's a buffet for them, you know what I mean?

208
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,120
今晚  他们将在唐人街安置捕鼠器
Tonight, they're laying traps in Chinatown.

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,530
你没事吧
Are you OK?

210
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,860
又有一只  伙计
Another one of these, man.

211
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,360
又是一只
Another one of these. 

212
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,860
你是如何令你的餐馆变成这个样子的
How do you even leave your restaurant like this?

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,220
老天啊  伙计  过来瞧瞧
Oh, man! Dude, look at this.

214
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,360
看看这些东西  寿司  米饭  面条
Look at all of this stuff! Sushi, rice, noodles.

215
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,070
老鼠什么都吃
Rats will eat anything,

216
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,690
从杂碎到筷子  来者不拒
from chop suey to the chopsticks themselves.

217
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,700
我们有钥匙  所以能够在夜晚进来
We walk in at night because we have keys.

218
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,920
顾客离开后我们才能工作
We have to go when the customers are gone.

219
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,740
当食客们离开餐馆时
And when the people leave the restaurant,

220
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,010
老鼠们觉得是时候出来活动了
the rats think it's time to come out.

221
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,270
我们还要再过会儿进来
But we go in there later,

222
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,810
大概餐馆关门一小时后
like an hour after they close,

223
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,840
那时它们都出来狂欢了
so they're out partying.

224
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,580
看到它了
Uh-oh. There he is, there he is,

225
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,290
就在那里
there he is. Right there, right there.

226
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,360
就在那个地方
Right there, right there, right there, right there.

227
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,030
看见了吗
See him?

228
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,590
它向下爬走了
He's going down, he's going down.

229
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,030
就在那里  在那个洞里
Right there. Right in the hole.

230
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,460
该死
Damn!

231
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,870
-它应该是在喝咖啡  -也许
- He was drinking coffee. - Something.

232
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,360
这种家伙最需要的就是咖啡了
That's the last thing that this guy needs is coffee.

233
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,190
真是难以置信
Unbelievable!

234
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,320
所以我从来不吃外卖
That's why I don't eat takeout, man.

235
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,420
是啊  你不吃才怪
Yes, you do.

236
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,550
来  伙计  到地下室去看看
Come on. Let's go to the basement, man.

237
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,430
小心  这里很滑
Watch out, man. It's slippery.

238
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,020
地下室里还有另一种令人发麻的东西
And there's another horror in the basement.

239
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,390
看看天花板上的虫子
Look at the bugs in the ceiling!

240
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,710
你肯定没见过这么壮观的景象
You don't ever see that.

241
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,000
就在门后面
Right there behind the door.

242
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,470
蟑螂
Cockroaches.

243
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,670
这是专业灭蟑螂的技术
This is professional extermination.

244
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,750
我来处理这些虫子
I got these bugs.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,550
你以前来过这间地下室吗
Oh! Have you seen this basement?

246
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,790
里面有什么  伙计
What's in there, man?

247
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,210
老式房屋通过管道和地下室互相连接
Old buildings connected by pipes and basements

248
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,160
使得老鼠和蟑螂在
allow the rats and roaches

249
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,110
城市里看不见的地方四处流窜
to scuttle through the city unseen.

250
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,260
这里太恶心了
It's disgusting in here.

251
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,410
水流得到处都是
Look at the water dripping all over the place.

252
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
一般我们尽量保持安静
We're basically trying to be quiet

253
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,930
仔细听任何类似
to hear noises for any, you know,

254
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,610
老鼠活动咬啮的声音
any signs of rat activities.

255
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,190
你听见了吗
You hear that? You hear that?

256
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,550
轻微的劈啪声
The little pitter-patter?

257
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,770
像指甲轻刮的声音
Little fingernails?

258
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,470
是的  在那里
Yup. Over here.

259
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,280
看这儿  可以直接看到...
Look at that. That goes right into the...

260
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
我能看到厨房
I can see the kitchen!

261
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,380
对于杰夫与朱尼尔来说  这是场长久战
For Jeff and Junior it's a lifelong fight.

262
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,330
据说在纽约
It's said there's at least one rat

263
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,180
有多少人就有多少只老鼠
for every person in New York.

264
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,880
那就是将近九百万只
That's nearly nine million rats.

265
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,360
就目前来看  人类战胜老鼠
As far as humans winning the battle over rats

266
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,810
应该是遥遥无期
nowhere close.

267
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,710
我不知道有什么办法能消灭它们
I don't even know how you would stop it,

268
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,780
真不知道
I really don't.

269
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,370
他们将利用一切可能的
They are going to use every contraption

270
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,210
奇特装备
they can devise

271
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,320
来对付可恶的害虫们
in the battle with the pests.

272
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,160
这是一个...
Well, this is a...

273
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,730
我并不想把它们都引出来  但是...
I don't want to call them out, but...

274
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,760
听听这个
Listen to that.

275
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,070
没有亲自来过的人们
All those people out there,

276
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,340
肯定无法想象这里发生了什么
they have no idea what's happening down here.

277
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,940
他们明天依旧会来这里就餐
And they're going to come eat here tomorrow.

278
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,160
这里可是全天半价啊
50% off all day, huh?

279
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,970
没错  难怪这么多人来
Yeah... Yeah, no wonder.

280
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,640
二十四小时之后
24 hours later,

281
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,870
杰夫和朱尼尔回来清点战果
Jeff and Junior are back to assess the death toll.

282
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,470
你好伙计
Ah, dude.

283
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,100
老鼠夹非常奏效
The snap traps have worked.

284
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,030
它还挺可爱的
He's cute.

285
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,220
这块捕鼠胶也战果颇丰
And the glue mats.

286
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,430
这只老鼠已经腐烂了
This one is decomposing.

287
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,350
还有老鼠药
And the poison.

288
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,460
老兄
Oh, dude!

289
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,350
-看看它的块头  -已经死了
- Look at the size of him! - He's dead.

290
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,040
看上去它当时奋力拼搏了一番
Looks like he's been fighting with something, bro.

291
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,590
看看它的牙齿
Damn! Look at them teeth, bro.

292
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,430
你说它得有多重
What's the weight on that?

293
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,710
我的手臂都酸了
I'm telling you, man. My arm got tired.

294
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,510
这只可真够厉害的
That's pretty... That's brutal.

295
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,370
真够大的
Oh, man!

296
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,050
这只是人类和死敌之间
This is just another night

297
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,820
永无休止的战争中的一夜而已
in the ongoing battle with our eternal enemies.

298
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,750
有时候我们要把它们装进袋子带走
Sometimes we'll walk out with bags of dead things

299
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,520
我一般用饭店提供的外卖袋
and I'll take a takeout bag from the restaurant

300
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,970
这样人们就以为我是来买外卖的
so people would think I'm leaving with takeout food.

301
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,750
还有更糟糕的
And it gets worse.

302
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,070
有些更小的生物会利用
There are other tiny creatures which take advantage

303
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,570
密集的都市人口而生存
of dense urban populations.

304
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,310
它们反而与我们亲密接触并加以利用
They exploit us in much more intimate ways.

305
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,610
大行其道  作威作福
They're reaching epidemic proportions.

306
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,230
不同于老鼠依赖我们为生
Not just feeding off us like rats,

307
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,090
它们简直就是以我们为食
but literally feeding on us.

308
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,280
家住伦敦的卡萝尔・安德森
Londoner Carol Anderson

309
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,060
就迎来了这些不速之客
has these unwanted house guests.

310
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,740
现在还有咬痕吗
Have you got any bites on you at the moment?

311
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,280
是这些吗
You mean these?

312
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,750
是的  就是被叮咬的这些伤痕
Yeah, the bites that you had all round here.

313
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,420
还是有些小红点吧
There's still little red marks from them, aren't there?

314
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,730
你觉得它们会藏在你房间的哪个地方
Where do you think they are in your room?

315
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,770
在床下吧
Down the side of the bed.

316
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,400
我也是这么想的
That's what I meant.

317
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,870
还在墙上爬来爬去
And crawling up the walls.

318
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,260
这种恼人的食客只在夜晚活动
Irritating parasites which only come out at night.

319
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,080
很好  过来
Right. Right. Come on, then.

320
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,400
该你了  上去吧
In you go. Hop up.

321
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,310
很好
That's it, then.

322
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,880
晚安  睡个好觉  别让...
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the...

323
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,550
臭虫咬到
Bedbugs bite.

324
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,850
但愿如此
Let's hope not.

325
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,970
臭虫就像是昆虫里的吸血鬼
Bedbugs are insect vampires

326
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,510
被二氧化碳
attracted to carbon dioxide,

327
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,380
热量还有人类的气味吸引而来
heat and body odours.

328
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,640
它们喜欢干净温暖的房子
They like clean, warm houses.

329
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,260
它们只吸食人类的血液
Their only food is human blood.

330
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,940
臭虫的数量真是令人生畏
The sheer numbers is quite daunting, really.

331
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,100
它们吸饱了血就顺墙而爬
They literally were streaming up the wall,

332
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,160
一直爬到天花板上
up to the ceiling, just full of blood.

333
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,630
每一只都喂得饱饱的
So they'd obviously all just been feeding.

334
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,480
每天早上醒过来第一件事
First thing in the morning,

335
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,140
就是检查身上被叮咬的痕迹
I woke up and looked up.

336
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,210
太恐怖了  恐怖之极
It was horrible, it really was horrible.

337
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,760
卡萝尔请来了
Carol calls in

338
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,800
业内最好的臭虫探测员
the best bedbug detector in the business,

339
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,190
一只叫查理的巧克力色的拉布拉多犬
Charlie the chocolate Labrador,

340
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,350
以及它的得力助手  驯犬师亚当
ably assisted by his handler, Adam.

341
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,910
沙发应该是
Right. Well, the sofa seems to

342
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,500
被污染最严重的  有很多臭虫在里面
be the worst affected. Got lots of bugs in here.

343
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,110
查理的鼻子比人类要灵敏四十四倍
Charlie's nose is 44 times more sensitive than ours.

344
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,100
他可以直接嗅出臭虫的藏匿之处
He can literally sniff out the bedbugs.

345
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,810
寻
Seek.

346
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,290
如果找到了  他就会坐下来
If they are present, he's trained to sit down.

347
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,750
干得好  查理
Good boy, Charlie.

348
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,110
亚当只需知道臭虫的位置
It's all Adam needs to know.

349
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,900
臭虫现在有日益增加的趋势
Bedbugs are on the increase,

350
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,910
它们搭人类旅行的顺风车辗转迁移
hitchhiking as we travel from city to city,

351
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,520
主要出没于家具之中  比如卡萝尔家的沙发
often infesting furniture like Carol's sofa.

352
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,720
我极其痛恨它们
I do resent them,

353
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,380
但又敬畏有加
but I quite admire them as well.

354
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,480
它们确实非常神奇
They're actually quite amazing,

355
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,180
甚至令人毛骨悚然
which makes it even creepier, you know,

356
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,510
因为这就是我要奋起反抗的东西
because... that's what I'm up against.

357
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,440
不过有了亚当的喷剂和查理灵敏的鼻子
But with Adam's spray and Charlie's nose,

358
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,060
这些虫子终于棋逢对手了
the bugs here have met their match.

359
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,200
它毕竟是个都市入侵者
This is one urban intruder

360
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,270
没人愿意和它同床共枕
nobody wants to live with.

361
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,460
不过在世界的某些角落
In some parts of the world,

362
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,500
人们已经学会了
people have learned

363
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,870
令这些都市入侵者物尽其用
to put their urban invaders to good use.

364
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,000
摩洛哥小城非斯  和迪拜相似
The Moroccan city of Fez, a bit like Dubai,

365
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,930
也遇到鸽子的问题
has a problem with pigeons.

366
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,330
但与迪拜人驱赶它们的做法不同
But rather than chasing them away,

367
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,480
非斯人反而将其请进来
the people of Fez invite them in.

368
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,330
诺丁在自家屋顶上为鸽子安了家
Nordine has built a home for pigeons on his roof.

369
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,160
这间阁楼是专供野生鸽子住的

370
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,780
我为它们提供了各式各样的提篮做巢

371
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,010
它们在这里生活得很舒适

372
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,250
否则也不会去而复返

373
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,960
他这样做不仅是出于对动物的热爱
He doesn't do this just for the love of animals.

374
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,590
鸽子粪对于当地的一项工业至关重要
Pigeon droppings are vital to a local industry.

375
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,970
诺丁的朋友塔米就时常购买这些粪便
And Nordine's friend Tami has come to buy some.

376
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,940
我给你准备了一些

377
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,850
看看

378
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,670
这些溶在水里肯定非常好

379
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,890
真不错

380
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,180
就这些了吗

381
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,030
对  都在这里了

382
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,950
塔米在当地一家皮革厂工作
Tami works at the local tannery.

383
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,650
非斯是摩洛哥皮革工业的中心
Fez is the centre of the Moroccan leather industry.

384
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,120
这里生产的皮革因质地柔软而出名
The leather here is famed for its softness,

385
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,550
鸽子粪便就是这秘方之一
and the pigeon droppings are a secret ingredient.

386
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,410
这是加工过程中最重要的一步

387
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,170
野生鸽子粪
Wild pigeon droppings

388
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,300
含有一种特殊的酶  可以分解
contain an enzyme which eats at the protein

389
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,260
动物毛皮中的蛋白质  起到软化作用
in the animal skin, softening it up.

390
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,390
皮革要在大缸里浸泡三天
The hides are soaked in the vats for three days,

391
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,900
塔米要用脚来完成工作
and Tami works them with his feet.

392
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,640
这可能是世界上最臭气熏天的工作了
This could be the stinkiest job in the world.

393
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,640
我第一次往里倒鸽子粪时

394
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,340
开始味道还不重

395
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,660
可是过一会儿就非常难闻了

396
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,610
对于塔米而言  这工作的薪水还不错
For Tami, it's a price worth paying.

397
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,840
鸽子的排泄物可以大大软化皮料
The pigeon droppings give the skins a softness

398
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,620
这是任何人造化学品都比不上的
no man-made chemical can produce.

399
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,880
如果我们不加粪便

400
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,410
皮料就达不到上乘的品质

401
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,970
有了非斯野生鸽子的帮助
Thanks to Fez's wild pigeons,

402
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,540
这些皮革能卖到一个好价钱
the skins will reach the highest possible price.

403
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,910
另外一座风格迥异的城市
Another very different city

404
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,790
也和都市入侵者共同合作
is also working with an urban intruder.

405
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,100
有时  即使是最不受欢迎的物种
Sometimes even the most unlikely species

406
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,490
也能与人类化敌为友
can turn out to be good news.

407
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,090
得克萨斯州的奥斯汀市
Austin, Texas,

408
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,980
现在是一百五十万只无尾蝙蝠的家园
is now home to 1.5 million free-tail bats and,

409
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,760
它们在这里很受欢迎
today, they are very welcome here.

410
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,470
二十年前  当它们在奥斯汀市中心的
20 years ago they set up home

411
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,310
这座桥上安家落户时
on this bridge in downtown Austin,

412
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,940
居民们曾一度想把它们赶走
and the residents wanted to get rid of them.

413
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,240
迈克船长至今还记忆犹新
River boatman Captain Mike remembers it well.

414
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,860
它们已经飞起来了
They're already taking off.

415
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,410
看右手边那些大树顶上
Look over the tree tops along the right-hand side.

416
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,490
它们已经开始外出活动了
They are off and running.

417
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,040
的确有很多人
There was a fair amount of

418
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,540
非常害怕这些蝙蝠
people that were actually afraid of the bats

419
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,370
因为担心
because they were afraid 

420
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,400
会被传染上狂犬病
we were going to have a rabies problem

421
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,060
或者爆发其他的疾病
or a disease outbreak,

422
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,250
所以当时有不少组织
so there were actually groups of people

423
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,790
游说议员和商界领袖
lobbying the city council and business leaders to

424
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,560
希望能将这些蝙蝠赶尽杀绝
figure out a way to exterminate the colony.

425
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,600
但是蝙蝠对这座城市却做出了卓越的贡献
But bats turned out to be helpful for the city.

426
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,430
通宵达旦的都市生活
The 24-hour urban lifestyle

427
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,040
意味着奥斯汀是一座不夜城
means that Austin is a city of light,

428
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,170
这引来了成千上万的昆虫
and that attracts millions of insects,

429
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,820
而它们恰是蝙蝠的美味便当
which are, in turn, fast food for bats.

430
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,010
每天晚上蝙蝠能吃掉六吨昆虫
Every night, the bats eat six tonnes of insects.

431
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,940
一年就能吃掉两千吨
That's an incredible 2,000 tonnes a year.

432
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,180
它们不仅仅是飞虫杀手
However, they're more than just bug-killers.

433
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,140
迈克船长更是从中嗅到了商机
Captain Mike saw bats as a commercial opportunity.

434
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,190
蝙蝠搬来这里后
I started doing bat-watching

435
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,360
我开始做蝙蝠观光的游船路线
cruises shortly after they moved in here,

436
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,180
一传十  十传百
and word spread and they started getting

437
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,010
观光路线越来越火
more and more popular.

438
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,260
在旺季  三月到十月期间
So we do those seven nights a

439
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,280
一周七天每晚都有观光游览
week during the season, from March to October.

440
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,530
蝙蝠对我的生意很是照顾
Bats have really helped me in my business,

441
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,780
我爱它们
so I love them.

442
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,300
如果你往桥底下看
If you look up underneath the bridge,

443
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,130
能看到蝙蝠从那些裂缝中飞出来
you will watch them drop out of these cracks here.

444
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,280
由于游客来观赏蝙蝠
Visitors who come to see the bats

445
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,480
这里的旅游业每年有一千万美元的收入
generate $10 million in tourist revenue every year.

446
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,960
因此这种无尾蝙蝠在德州属于保护动物
So the free-tail bats of the state capital are now protected.

447
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,860
看来人类仍然期望回归自然
It turns out we still want to be connected to nature,

448
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,740
也许这是我们一直以来的夙愿
and perhaps we always have.

449
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,470
在印度  一些居民
In India, one group of people

450
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,130
将对动物的保护行为发挥到了极致
take caring for animals to the ultimate extreme,

451
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,980
而且他们世世代代皆是如此
and they've been doing it for centuries.

452
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,350
希亚姆・桑德在他的家乡拉贾斯坦的近郊
Shyam Sunder has rescued a chinkara gazelle

453
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,420
救了一只瞪羚
on the outskirts of his town in Rajasthan.

454
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,010
她的妈妈被杀死了
Her mother has been killed.

455
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,090
小瞪羚若不喝奶便无法存活
Without milk, the fawn will not survive,

456
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,450
因此希亚姆将它带回了家
so Shyam is taking her home.

457
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,030
在我们这里

458
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,320
大家都很喜爱小瞪羚

459
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,930
看我给妈妈带来什么了

460
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,460
一旦小瞪羚

461
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,180
来到我们的居所

462
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,540
便马上成为家庭中的一员

463
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,320
他们给她起名为阿缇
They're calling her Arti,

464
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,920
并在她额头点上檀香以示欢迎
and a spot of sandalwood honours her arrival.

465
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,950
欢迎你  阿缇

466
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,430
希亚姆的妻子凯安曾照顾过很多瞪羚
Kyran, Shyam's wife, has cared for many gazelles.

467
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,220
上次我照顾的小瞪羚是个孤儿

468
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,770
它的妈妈被狗咬死了

469
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,110
桑德一家人信奉印度教
The Sunders belong to a Hindu

470
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,860
崇尚自然之神  比什诺伊
sect of nature worshippers called the Bishnoi.

471
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,740
希亚姆为比什诺伊神庙供应牛奶
Shyam supplies milk to the Bishnoi temple,

472
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,290
那里收留了很多孤儿
which has its own orphans to care for.

473
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,410
比什诺伊是印度最早的环保主义者
The Bishnoi were India's first environmentalists

474
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,930
他们将自己的传统
and have brought their traditions

475
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,420
带到每个角落
from the country into the towns and cities.

476
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,450
他们将瞪羚视为自己的孩子
It is their belief that gazelles are their children

477
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,300
源于这种信奉  比什诺伊的妇女
and so the Bishnoi women 

478
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,160
对它们百般呵护
show an incredible act of kindness.

479
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,330
她们亲自哺乳那些不愿喝瓶装奶的小瞪羚
They breast-feed the fawns that don't take to the bottle.

480
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,900
可以吗

481
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,010
没关系

482
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,250
对瞪羚来讲  母乳喂养是最佳方式
Even for gazelles, breast is best.

483
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,920
我必须先保证它有奶喝

484
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,310
因为它不喝别的奶

485
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,550
在我们这里  这是司空见惯的事情

486
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,230
小瞪羚对我们来说是神圣的

487
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,350
在与新家庭相处六周之后  阿缇断奶了
After six weeks with her new family, Arti is weaned.

488
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,190
它现在结实又健康
She's now fit and healthy.

489
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,900
希亚姆可以带它回归自然了
Shyam can take her back to the wild.

490
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,210
每个母亲送别自己的孩子都十分伤感
Watching a child leave home is always tough for a mum,

491
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,270
即便这个母亲只是临时的
even a surrogate one.

492
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,880
阿缇回到沙漠了
Arti is returned to the desert,

493
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,950
它将与自己的群落一同生活
where she'll join up with the wild herds.

494
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,490
这只不过是一念之慈
This may appear to be a tiny gesture of kindness,

495
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,910
但我们这些都市居民需要依赖于
but all of us who live in cities need the nature that exists

496
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,150
城市堡垒之外的自然环境
beyond the city walls,

497
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,830
因为大自然为都市各类需求提供资源
because the natural world feeds our hungry cities.

498
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,650
都市丛林得到了其所需的一切
And what the urban jungle needs, the urban jungle gets.

499
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,720
目前  城市人口数量已突破三十亿
More than three billion of us now live in cities.

500
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,470
为保证如此庞大人口的正常生活
To feed this huge population,

501
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,020
我们一年到头都在不停地
we ship in billions of

502
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,940
运输大量新鲜食品和农产品
tons of fresh food and produce all year round.

503
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,810
科技发展已允许我们从千里之外
We have the technology to bring in what we want

504
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,570
运输各类所需物品
from thousands of kilometres away.

505
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,570
在西班牙本地可以种植桃子
Peaches may grow here in Spain,

506
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,830
但却从南美洲进口
but these are imported from South America.

507
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,360
我们可以随时得到自己所需要的物品
We consume what we want, when we want it.

508
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,700
饮食已不再受地理和季节的束缚
We no longer need to eat locally or seasonally.

509
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,550
然而我们的胃口永难满足
And we have an insatiable appetite.

510
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,600
虽然娴熟于从自然界中获取
We've never been so good at exploiting nature.

511
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,560
但却难以处理其带来的后果
But we're not quite so good at dealing with the consequences.

512
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,860
巨大的消耗产生了大量的垃圾
Massive consumption creates mountains of waste.

513
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,210
仅在英国  每年就能产生
In the UK alone, we produce

514
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,250
一亿吨的垃圾
over 100 million tons of rubbish each year.

515
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,480
我们将之倾倒在杳无人烟的郊外
And we dump it safely out of sight.

516
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,070
内衣物品

517
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,830
而在某些地区  垃圾堆成了少数人的家园
But in some places, this world is home to an unfortunate few.

518
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,530
二十四小时购物

519
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,490
这里是肯尼亚的蒙巴萨
Here in Mombasa, Kenya,

520
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,850
人们赖以生存的正是他人丢弃的垃圾
people must scratch a living from the things others throw away.

521
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,050
对于阿什和她的家人来说
For Ashe and her family,

522
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,490
这个垃圾场既是家也是百宝箱
this dump is both home and hunting ground.

523
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,500
他们是现代社会的采猎者
They are modern-day hunter-gatherers,

524
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,160
在都市丛林的阴暗角落里
adapted to survival on the dark side

525
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,990
挣扎求生
of the urban jungle.

526
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,630
大多时候  一觉醒来

527
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,270
我就会来到这个垃圾场开始寻觅

528
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,450
在这里其实就是拾破烂

529
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,160
比如说瓶子  罐头

530
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,510
麻袋  还有塑料制品

531
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,480
捡得差不多之后

532
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,660
就拿去卖

533
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,530
垃圾车里也有食物

534
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,920
有扁豆  玉米和大豆之类的

535
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,090
垃圾车到达以后
When a rubbish truck arrives,

536
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,420
一场争夺大战就开始了
the race is on to grab the best scraps.

537
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,880
阿什的丈夫阿里正身处其中
Ashe's husband, Ali, gets stuck in.

538
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,350
这便是边缘生活
This really is life on the edge,

539
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,000
在城市垃圾中为自己的孩子寻找食物
finding food for your children in a city's rubbish.

540
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,040
目前  大多数人类都居住在城市里
More than half of us now live in cities.

541
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,180
我们正以空前的速度消耗着自然资源
And we're using up nature's resources as never before.

542
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,320
毫无疑问  我们是这个星球上最具创造力
We are, without doubt, the most inventive

543
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,870
且最强大的生物
and powerful creature on the planet.

544
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,010
我们是如此成功
We're so successful,

545
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,640
为满足自己的需求  搜刮了星球的每个角落
we've hijacked the whole world for our own ends.

546
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,920
然而  这种贪欲带来的后果
But the consequences of our

547
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,900
已经无法控制
voracious lives are spiralling out of control.

548
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,630
我们已经让自然界陷入危机了吗
Are we pushing the natural world towards a crisis?

549
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,660
我们该怎么办
Where do we go from here?

550
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,160
现在已经出现了一部分引领时代的先驱者
There are a few people who seem to be heading in a new direction.

551
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,920
他们正在尝试建造一座与自然协调的城市
One challenge is to design a city that's in balance with nature.

552
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,150
这是马斯达  一个位于
This is Masdar, a green

553
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,060
阿布扎比沙漠的绿色之城
city being built in the desert of Abu Dhabi.

554
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,590
这座城市的设计者是建筑师诺曼・福斯特
It's designed by architect Norman Foster.

555
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,340
马斯达令我很振奋
Masdar excites me

556
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,930
因为这是目前
because it's really the only true experiment

557
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,060
地球上唯一一座
on the planet, at the moment,

558
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,130
旨在达到零碳无污染的
in terms of seeking to achieve an environment,

559
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,370
社区  或者说是小型城市的实验基地
a community, a mini city, which is carbon free and waste free.

560
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,210
建在世界任何地方都会是个严峻的挑战
Now, that would be a tough challenge anywhere in the world.

561
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,070
要想在沙漠里完成这样的工程  别人会说
To do it in a desert environment, you could say, you know,

562
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,760
"这想法都很疯狂"
''You must be crazy to even attempt it.''

563
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,370
马斯达将以太阳能作为能源
Masdar will be powered by the sun.

564
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,480
在这里不会浪费一滴水
It will not waste a single drop of water.

565
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,370
没有消耗汽油的汽车
There will be no need for gas-guzzling cars.

566
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,400
建造马斯达的出发点
The starting point for Masdar

567
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,290
是与自然协作  根据太阳活动周期
was really working with nature, in terms of the solar cycle,

568
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,010
种植树木  并不仅仅为了美观
making the greenery, not just a cosmetic greenery,

569
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,680
而是营造绿荫  消耗我们所产生的废物
but creating shade, burning the waste that we produce

570
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,930
并在这个过程中制造能源
and, out of that process, creating energy.

571
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,880
这个工程源于自然  利用科技
So it's starting with nature and then it's using the technology,

572
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,530
与自然鼎力合作  相辅相成
working with nature, in harness with nature.

573
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,470
这项宏图大志定能取得成功
It is a noble ambition and it can be achieved.

574
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,770
然而  当前最紧要的
However, the immediate challenge

575
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,510
是想办法改变
is to try and change the way

576
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,670
城市里  我们与自然共存的方式
we live with nature in our existing cities.

577
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,330
这里是纽约联合广场的市场
This is the Union Square market in New York.

578
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,900
田间种植  西红柿

579
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,630
这里卖的商品都产自本地  通常生长在
It sells produce that's grown locally, often on the rooftops

580
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,890
纽约大楼的天台上
of New York's tower blocks.

581
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,560
你好  想尝尝我们的蜂蜜吗
Hello, would you like to try some of our honey?

582
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,150
荞麦粉
Buckwheat.

583
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,260
本地人吗  浓缩蜂蜜要吗  女士
Local? Whipped honey, Miss?

584
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,710
-不要吗  -怕甜吗
- No? - Too sweet?

585
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,890
不喜欢甜吗
You're sweet enough?

586
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:33,950
早上好
Good morning.

587
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,240
要蜂蜜吗  小姐  来就对了
Honey for you, Miss? Ah, you're doing the right thing.

588
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,820
传统主义者
A traditionalist.

589
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,220
安德鲁・科特是
Andrew Cote is the guru

590
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,580
高级养蜂专家  传到他已是第三代
of high-rise beekeeping and a third generation beekeeper.

591
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,520
直到最近  在纽约城里养蜂
Until recently, urban beekeeping

592
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,430
还是非法的  但这并不能阻止安德鲁
was illegal in New York, but that didn't stop Andrew.

593
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,920
我从没被抓住过
Personally, in my case, I was never caught.

594
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,120
虽然我养蜂的事情众所周知
Even though I was very public about having bees,

595
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,630
但我从未透漏过养蜂地点
I didn't tell people exactly where they were.

596
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,370
先生  十美元  来一罐吗
Yes, sir. $10, would you like a bag?

597
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,550
好消息是  纽约把这条禁令取消了
Happily, New York changed its mind and Andrew's mission

598
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,720
于是安德鲁开始将蜜蜂普及到各家各户
is to bring bees into everyone's lives.

599
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,910
今天  他来到曼哈顿一座豪华公寓的阳台
Today, he's on the balcony of a swanky Manhattan apartment

600
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,190
同他一起的是新手王薇薇
with novice, Vivien Wang.

601
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,100
你可能会对蜂箱的盖子望而却步
You're going to have a problem with the outer cover,

602
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,450
因为蜜蜂太多了
because there are a lot of bees on the inside of it.

603
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,460
喷烟
Smoke 'em.

604
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,840
只要看见蜜蜂就喷烟
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

605
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,570
安德鲁有点像是蜂王
Andrew is sort of the king bee,

606
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,930
在城市养蜂业里
I think, of urban beekeeping,

607
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,970
作为他的学生
and those of us who are his students,

608
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,090
我觉得自己就像是蜂蜜大师的学徒
I think of myself as the honey sorcerer's apprentice, in a way.

609
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,440
你看到什么了
What do you see?

610
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,100
这下面覆盖着很多蜂蜜
I see a lot of cap honey under here.

611
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,500
这东西有点像
And I see... it looks like...

612
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,850
花蜜
a lot of nectar.

613
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,290
对这位纽约的律师来说  这是个新奇的经历
It's an unusual pastime for a New York lawyer.

614
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,280
当我告诉我的朋友
I think my friends, when I told them

615
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,020
我要开始学习养蜂
that I was going to start being a beekeeper,

616
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,810
他们都很震惊  他们觉得这事既古怪又奇妙
were amused. They thought it was quirky but kind of wonderful,

617
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,160
因为这是与大自然接触的与众不同的方式
because it's a different way for us to all connect with nature.

618
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
我想我们都需要在生活中加点料
I think all of us need a little more sweetness in our lives

619
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,970
这令我们的视野投放于
and it's nice to be able to cast our eyes

620
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,700
城市上空  远离嘈杂
skyward in this city, you know, away and above the traffic,

621
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,020
脑子里只想着周围嗡嗡乱窜的蜜蜂
and think about all these bees buzzing above our heads.

622
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,490
但作为养蜂新手  意外总是难免的
But being a novice beekeeper has its ups and downs.

623
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,230
怎么了
What, what, what?

624
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,240
没事  我没想到
Nothing. Sorry, I didn't know

625
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
它们能蛰到我的手
they could sting through hands quite like that.

626
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,630
它们在疯狂地蜇人  你先离开这儿
They're stinging me like crazy. I really want you to let go.

627
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,890
目前有一千万只蜜蜂
There are now nearly ten

628
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,330
生活在纽约的屋顶上
million bees living on the rooftops of New York.

629
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,270
在皇后区的河边
Over the river in Queens,

630
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,470
今天是养蜂人史芬尼的好日子
it's a special day for beekeeper Stefanos.

631
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,650
他正在安德鲁的协助下收获第一桶蜂蜜
He's harvesting his first honey with Andrew's help.

632
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,550
-这个很棒  没法再好了  -是啊  看
- This one's perfect. Couldn't be better. - Oh, yes, look.

633
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,890
我觉得我们该尝尝味道
I think we should give the honey a taste, just...

634
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,280
以求确保
Just to make sure.

635
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,700
伙计  这绝对是极品
Oh, man, this is going to be so good.

636
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,690
我的天
Oh, my God.

637
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,960
这味道就像是阳光味的焦糖
It's like caramelised sunlight.

638
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,280
-你在做质检  -没错
- It's just quality control. - Right.

639
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,310
蜜蜂酿蜜  还能对公园和花园里的花朵授粉
Bees make honey and they pollinate the city's parks and gardens.

640
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,090
但最重要的是
But most importantly,

641
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,520
它们令纽约人回到了大自然的怀抱
they bring New Yorkers back in touch with nature.

642
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,750
我觉得城市里很多人都在养蜂
I think a lot of people are beekeeping in the city

643
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,120
因为他们想更亲近大自然
because they want to feel a connection to nature.

644
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,110
他们住在高楼大厦  走在沥青马路
They live in tall buildings, they walk on asphalt,

645
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,120
平时乘坐地铁
they ride around in trains under the ground.

646
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,470
如果在楼顶有这么个蜂箱
When they have a beehive on their roof,

647
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,530
他们每周就能花上一两个小时
they can spend one or two hours a week,

648
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:07,030
真正去亲近大自然  自食其力
and really be connected to nature, and be creating their own food

649
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,680
没有碳足迹  我觉得这很棒
with almost no footprint, and I think that's great.

650
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,660
纽约的养蜂业虽不能拯救地球
Beekeeping in New York isn't going to save the planet,

651
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,010
但至少前进了一大步
but it's a step in the right direction.

652
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,860
毫无疑问
There is just no doubt.

653
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,930
如若我们继续居住在城市
If we are to continue living in cities,

654
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,690
就必须停止向大自然的肆意掠夺
we'll have to stop stripping

655
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,530
静心想想人类的未来
nature bare with no thought for tomorrow.

656
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,350
我们在室内和户外的所作所为
What we do in our homes

657
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,250
将会影响到整个地球
and in our streets affects the entire planet.

658
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,070
人类文明的未来
The future of our civilisation

659
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,820
取决于我们重建
depends on us restoring the balance

660
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,030
大自然与都市丛林间的平衡关系
between the natural world and the urban jungle.

661
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,070
我们能做到吗
Can we do it?

662
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:08,620
希望的曙光在世界各地熠熠发光
There are clear signs of hope from around the world.

663
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,880
我们的聪明才智和创造力
We do have the intelligence and ingenuity

664
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,290
能够适应变幻莫测的世界
to adapt to a changing world.

665
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,780
古老的训鹰术
The ancient art of falconry

666
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,200
现在用来保护迪拜这座现代都市
now helps protect the modern city of Dubai.

667
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,700
我们能够与大自然联手
We can work hand in hand

668
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,780
解决我们所面临的问题
with nature to solve the problems we face.

669
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,550
在印度  我们用无花果树建造的桥仍在生长
In India, we train fig trees to make living bridges.

670
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,900
我们与大象合作获取珍贵的木材
And we team up with elephants to extract valuable timber

671
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,510
却不毁坏整个森林
without trashing the whole forest.

672
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,000
我们可以站在整体的角度思考问题
We can think as a community

673
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,570
未雨绸缪
and plan ahead.

674
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,610
在马里
In Mali,

675
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,600
每年人们只能在这片湖里捕一次鱼
the fish in this lake are shared out only once a year.

676
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,430
当人类与自然合作  就能取得卓越成就
When we work together, it's incredible what we can achieve.

677
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,560
泥泞的杰内古城的居民
Everyone in the mud city of Djenne

678
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,040
通力协作保护他们神圣的清真寺
collaborates to protect their sacred mosque.

679
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,960
面对逆境  我们拥有如此斗志和胆识
We have such spirit and such bravery in the face of adversity.

680
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,890
如果我们能将这种本能
If we combine these natural abilities

681
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,180
与完美的想象力和高明的见解相结合
with the best of our imagination and our biggest ideas,

682
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:36,390
那我们的城市定能续写新的篇章
then surely our cities can adapt and change.

683
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,700
人类星球的命运就掌握在我们手中
The destiny of our planet is now in human hands.

684
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,000
人类星球
镜头背后的故事

685
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,340
《人类星球》摄制组历时三年
Over three years, the Human Planet team

686
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,210
前往世界各地对人物进行拍摄
has filmed people around the world.

687
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,560
这些人都有着惊人的忍耐力
All had amazing endurance,

688
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,610
各自的生存秘诀和聪明才智
local know-how, and ingenuity.

689
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,850
仅是跟拍就是一个巨大的挑战
Just keeping up with them proved to be a huge challenge.

690
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,470
摄制组的要求和装备
The demands on our teams and kit

691
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,530
迫使他们挑战极限
pushed them to the limit.

692
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,370
拍摄爪哇岛的活火山
Filming on an active volcano

693
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,170
测试了摄像机的极限工作能力
in Java tested the cameras to breaking point.

694
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,500
工作人员来此拍摄硫磺矿
The crew were here to film sulphur miners.

695
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,920
周围的空气对人体和器材都有损害
The air they breathe was a danger to both people and kit.

696
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,720
蒂娜・穆芙蒂
人类星球剧组调研员

697
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,890
我要走近一点  用气量计
I'm just going to go in there, a bit closer, with a gas meter

698
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,240
测试一下环境
and see what it does.

699
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,180
读数为百万分之九十三
It's reading 93 parts per million.

700
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,970
现在升到一百九十四了
It's going up to 194 now.

701
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,520
我们在烟雾的正中心  得赶快离开这里
So we're right in the middle of a cloud. We've got to get out.

702
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,540
这是安全工作上限的四十倍
This is 40 times the safe working limit.

703
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,790
这种气体是一种硫化氢的混合物
The gas is a hydrogen sulphide mix

704
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,760
其所到之处  必受腐蚀
that corrodes every surface it lands on.

705
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,880
防毒面具保护了工作人员
The gas masks protected the crew,

706
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,510
而摄像机却遭了殃
but not the cameras.

707
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,360
摄像机出现电磁射频的警告
We've got an RF warning on the camera,

708
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:37,310
基斯・帕特里奇
摄像师

709
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,860
就是说信号没法传入录像带
which means that the signal's not actually getting onto the tape.

710
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,060
一般是磁头堵塞
It's usually a head clog.

711
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,200
工作人员发现硫化物的微粒粘在了磁头上
The crew found that sulphide particles had stuck to the tape head

712
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,210
现在必须拆机
and open-heart surgery was needed.

713
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,040
这真是太脏了
That's absolutely filthy.

714
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,130
清理之后  摄像机又能重新工作了
After cleaning, the camera lived to work another day.

715
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,330
然而这些问题
But the crew's problems

716
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,330
和那些每天面对硫磺矿的矿工相比
were nothing compared to those faced daily

717
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,150
简直不值一提
by the sulphur miners.

718
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,430
在婆罗洲附近的苏禄海中
In the Sulu Sea off Borneo,

719
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,020
摄像师西蒙・恩德比
cameraman Simon Enderby

720
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:17,310
拍下了渔民萨尔兵惊人的屏气潜水过程
filmed a remarkable free-diving fisherman called Sulbin.

721
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,240
现在我配置着最先进的水中呼吸器
Here I was with the latest in scuba gear,

722
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,820
而他只穿着泳裤  戴着木质游泳镜
and he was swimming in a pair of underpants and wooden goggles.

723
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,530
我们组成了极不协调的潜水二人组
We really made for a bizarre dive duo.

724
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,100
为了捕捉到完美的捕猎画面  
To capture the perfect hunt, 

725
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,200
身着潜水装置的我必须
I had to match my scuba-dive skills

726
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,340
配合好他的自由潜水
with those of Sulbin's free-diving.

727
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,230
保持相同的浮力  泳姿  找寻猎物
Our buoyancy, our swimming, our search for food, and, finally,

728
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,770
最后他成功捕获到一条鱼
his successful capture of a fish,

729
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,090
这些全部都要配合得天衣无缝
all had to evolve together.

730
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,760
幸运的是  在第三次潜水时
Luckily, on the third dive,

731
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,520
终于天时地利人和  我们都很满意
it all came together, and we both came up happy.

732
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,350
伙计  这次很好  这次太完美了
Oh, wow, mate, that's the one. That's definitely the one.

733
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,980
在菲律宾  我们拍摄渔民们
In the Philippines, we filmed fishermen

734
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,680
用一张大网捕捉暗礁里的鱼群
herding all the fish on a reef into a huge net.

735
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,230
在这  我们发现鱼的适应能力也很强
Here, we found that fish can be adaptable too.

736
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,270
摄影师罗杰・沐恩斯
Cameraman Roger Munns

737
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,080
无意间把一条鱼从餐桌上救了下来
inadvertently saved one fish from becoming supper.

738
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,110
他给它起名叫尼莫
He nicknamed him Nemo.

739
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,310
尼莫躲在罗杰的潜水装备里
Nemo sheltered in Roger's dive kit

740
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,070
直到危险解除
and hid there until the coast was clear,

741
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,290
才游回家园
eventually swimming off back home.

742
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,800
在我们拍摄的很多地方
We filmed in many locations

743
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,330
当地人甚至不知道摄像机为何物
where people had never seen film cameras before.

744
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,380
在印度北部  孩子们目不转睛地盯着镜头
In northern India, the children constantly looked into the lens.

745
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,200
为了拍到导演马克・福劳斯想要的镜头
So, to get the shots he wanted,

746
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,670
他试图用唱歌来转移孩子们的注意力
director Mark Flowers tried to distract the children by singing a song.

747
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,180
我这辈子从没唱过歌
I never sing in my whole life!

748
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,200
出乎他意料的是
Much to his surprise,

749
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,100
孩子们比他还熟悉这首儿歌的旋律
the children knew the nursery rhymes better than he did.

750
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,590
-一闪一闪亮晶晶  -我们学过
- Twinkle, twinkle, little star.  - We learn this.

751
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,790
满天都是小星星
How I wonder what you are.

752
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:24,860
挂在天上放光明  好像千万小眼睛
Up above the world so high. Like a diamond in the sky.

753
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,130
高空拍摄总会牵涉到复杂的安全措施
Filming at height always involves complex safety measures.

754
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,330
但在非洲中部  摄制小组的难度加大了
But in Central Africa, the crew had an added complication.

755
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,510
蒂姆・福格系上绳索拍摄泰特
Tim Fogg rigged ropes to film Tete collecting honey

756
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,600
在野生蜂巢取蜂蜜的场景

757
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,460
不幸的是  愤怒的蜜蜂直冲蒂姆而来
Unfortunately, the angry bees went straight for Tim.

758
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:00,430
-他没事吧  -喷烟  喷烟  快点儿
- Think he'll be OK? - Smoke! Smoke! Smoke, quickly!

759
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,930
需要帮忙吗  蒂姆
Can we get you out, Tim?

760
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,390
我记得一开始
The first thing I remember

761
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,150
看见一只蜜蜂就在我的面前
seeing was a bee right in front of my face

762
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,560
腹部扭动  好像是要蛰我了
with its abdomen twisted as if it was ready to sting me.

763
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,550
它们进去了吗
They got inside?

764
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,280
没有  它们隔着面具
No, they were stinging

765
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,820
和手套叮咬
through the face mask and through the gloves.

766
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,600
在被蛰了三十个伤口后
After 30 stings,

767
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,700
蒂姆彻底折服于泰特
Tim fully appreciated Tete's

768
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,700
为家人寻找蜂蜜的勇气
bravery in gathering honey for his family.

769
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,390
拍摄人与动物时  一切都是未知的
When filming people with animals, nothing's entirely predictable.

770
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,390
在格陵兰岛  导演尼克・布朗想拍摄
In Greenland, director Nic Brown wanted to film

771
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,580
因纽特人捕捉睡鲨的场景
the Inuit catching the elusive Greenland shark

772
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,110
这种鲨鱼生活在深水区并难以捕捉
that lives in these deep waters.

773
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,130
在焦急地等待了十天后
After an anxious ten days,

774
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:06,100
每个人都很紧张
everyone was thrilled when,

775
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,600
终于在午夜
in the middle of the night,

776
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,310
他们感觉到有东西碰到绳子了
they finally felt something on the line.

777
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,970
西蒙・福斯特
录音师

778
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,760
我们都很兴奋
We're very excited

779
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,280
因为我们一直在玩弄这根绳子
because we've all been playing with the line

780
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,970
它深入水中八百米
that's 800 metres down into the water

781
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,540
而且你能明显感觉到鲨鱼就在绳子的那头
and you can actually feel the shark on the end of it.

782
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,290
我们觉得冰层下的某处
Somewhere down there we think we've got a,

783
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,580
睡鲨上钩了
er, Greenland shark on a hook.

784
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,780
我们非常期待
We're hoping.

785
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,400
这个洞是留给水下摄像机的
This is the hole for our underwater camera,

786
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,340
-而这个洞  -用来捕鲨的吗
- and this is the hole... - A shark hole?

787
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,490
对
for the shark.

788
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,930
他们发现低估了洞的大小
They discovered they'd underestimated the hole size,

789
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,570
因为简森斯捕到了一条四米长的鲨鱼
because the Jensens had caught a huge four-metre-long shark.

790
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,480
这洞口太小了

791
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,410
对  我们必须把洞凿宽点

792
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,660
直升机与地面活动的良好协调
Co-ordinating helicopters with action on the ground

793
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,330
既费钱又非易事
is both expensive and difficult.

794
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,270
在澳大利亚  导演苏珊・麦克米伦
But in Australia, director Susan McMillan

795
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,820
需要同时指挥三架直升机
had to co-ordinate three helicopters at once.

796
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,740
其中两架是由直升机驾驶员本・泰普
Two of them were flown by heli-cowboys Ben Tapp

797
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,530
和他的同伴兰金所驾驶
and his mate Rankin,

798
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,890
他们疯狂地驱赶牛群
dicing with death to corral their cattle.

799
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,230
空中三架直升机参与拍摄
The challenges of filming with three helicopters in the air

800
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,130
在这次行程中起到重要作用
have been quite considerable on this trip,

801
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:27,730
苏珊・麦克米伦
人类星球导演

802
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:23,890
因为这样的效果非常真实
because I'm filming it for real.

803
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,060
这不是拍戏  没有第二遍
It's not a drama and there's no take two.

804
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,220
我必须在事情发生的一瞬间捕获到镜头
I have to actually capture the event as it happens,

805
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,770
而且当时情况十分危险
and it's quite a dangerous situation.

806
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,190
天上有三架直升机
I've got three helicopters in the air,

807
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,640
地上有沙滩车和马
I've got quad bikes and horses on the ground,

808
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,550
还有狂奔的牛群
I've got stampeding cattle,

809
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,410
所以  最大的问题  就是保证安全
so, actually, the biggest pressure, I think, has been safety.

810
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,200
在地面的工作是相当危险的
Working on the ground can be just as dangerous,

811
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,080
尤其是遇见大型猫科动物时
especially when it comes to big cats.

812
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,330
摄制组想拍摄肯尼亚的多罗博人
The crew wanted to film Dorobo tribesmen in Kenya

813
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,560
追杀狮子的镜头
chasing lions off a kill.

814
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,230
摄影师托比・斯特朗主动请缨跟拍
So cameraman Toby Strong offered to film with them on foot,

815
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,340
以便拍摄他们行动最为激烈的时刻
to be in the thick of the action.

816
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,180
不用汽车
The thought of getting out

817
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,850
徒步走向狮子这个想法
of a vehicle and walking towards lions on foot

818
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,550
与我整个人都格格不入
goes against every common sense bone in my body.

819
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,600
我是说  这些人  太强悍了
I mean, these guys are... these guys are amazing.

820
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,000
他们拿着弓箭
They, um... They've got their bows and arrows.

821
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,470
但我什么都没有
But, um, I haven't got anything!

822
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,960
我只有...
I've got...

823
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,310
我只有摄像机和镜头盖来保护自己
...I've got a camera and a lens cap to protect myself with.

824
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,650
有点动真格了  对吧
It's getting a bit real, though, isn't it?

825
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,300
真令人忐忑
Butterflies in the stomach.

826
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,840
确定狮子的方位后
Having located the lions,

827
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,010
托比跟随多罗博人一起前进
Toby followed the Dorobo as they moved in

828
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,400
去看个究竟
to have a look.

829
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,160
朝茂密的灌木丛走去
Walking down there towards thick

830
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,500
而且你明明还知道那里有狮子
bushes where you know there are lions,

831
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,280
天呐  脖颈发凉
God, it's something very primal in the back of your neck,

832
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,590
毛骨悚然
and everything... the hairs on the back of your neck

833
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,910
感觉自己万众瞩目
and you just feel these eyes on you,

834
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,410
但是非常有活力
but you feel very, very alive.

835
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,480
真是神奇的感觉
It's a magical feeling. 

836
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,240
我似乎对所有人都说了
It's, um... I sort of recommend it to everyone.

837
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,810
工作之前  在狮城散散步
Before going to work, have a walk through lion country.

838
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,770
这会加强自己的理解能力
It gets things in perspective.

839
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,380
真的  很神奇
Yeah, amazing.

840
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,150
若没有世界各地所拍之人的
Without the co-operation and support of all the people

841
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,330
配合与支持
we filmed around the world,

842
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,630
就不可能有本片的诞生
this series could not have been made.

843
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,850
他们独特的知识与生存技能
Their unique knowledge and survival skills

844
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,940
在人口渐增的地球之上
have relevance for us all 

845
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,370
起着举足轻重的作用
in an increasingly human planet.

846
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:39,820
第八集  完  [本片终]
