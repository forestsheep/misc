1
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:10,125
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,605
在地球的每一个角落都留下了印迹
in every habitat on earth.

3
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:16,395
那就是人类
That creature is us.

4
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:20,375
天地悠悠
All over the world,

5
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:25,185
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
we still use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

6
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,015
远离文明开化的城市
far from the city lights,

7
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,065
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

8
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,575
沙漠是地球上最热最干的地方
Deserts are the hottest and driest places on earth.

9
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,895
它们覆盖着地表的三分之一
They cover one third of the land surface.

10
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:02,015
有些地区一雨难求
Some never see rain.

11
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,935
我们可以两个月不吃东西
We can survive two months without food,

12
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:13,175
但不喝水则活不了几天
yet only a few days without water.

13
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,485
作为胎儿  我们被液体包围着
As babies, we spend nine months

14
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,335
要在母亲的子宫里待上九个月
surrounded by fluid in our mother's womb.

15
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:26,075
但分娩之后  我们再无幸享受那奢华的水世界
But birth pushes us out of this luxurious water world.

16
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,255
从这一刻起
From this point on,

17
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:40,665
能否找到充足的水
life for every child of the desert

18
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,415
决定了沙漠里每一个孩子的生命
is defined by the quest for water.

19
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,775
难以置信的是
Yet somehow, in this brutal land,

20
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,255
在这片残酷的土地上有三亿人生存了下来
an incredible 300 million people survive.

21
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,455
以下就是他们的非凡故事
These are their remarkable stories.

22
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:20,555
沙漠

23
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:20,555
熔炉中的生命

24
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:30,735
撒哈拉是全球最大的沙漠
The Sahara is the biggest desert on the globe.

25
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,095
其面积堪比美国
It is the size of the United States,

26
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:41,125
从它干旱的内陆
and its arid interior can

27
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,935
可释放出地球上最强势的沙尘暴
unleash the mightiest sandstorms on the planet.

28
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:54,935
猛烈的狂风卷起成万上亿颗细小的沙粒
Ferocious winds whip up billions of tiny sand grains

29
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,695
形成一堵巨大的沙墙
into massive walls.

30
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,415
五千米高的沙墙拔地而起
Reaching more than 5,000 metres into the air,

31
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:05,535
其高度是帝国大厦的十倍
ten times the height of the Empire State Building,

32
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,565
其面积足以覆盖大不列颠
covering areas the size of Britain.

33
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:23,025
一名16岁的男童玛玛杜
Battling through this sandstorm in Mali

34
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,625
在马里的沙尘暴中挣扎求生
is 16-year-old Mamadou.

35
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,815
他是一个牧牛人  三天前离开家
He's a cattle herder who left home three days ago

36
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:32,665
踏上为牛寻水的征途
on a mission to find water for his cows.

37
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,295
奶牛就是我的命

38
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,045
它们维持着全家的生活

39
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:41,815
如果找不到水  奶牛就会死

40
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:46,575
他稚幼的双肩扛起了无比艰巨的责任
It's a huge responsibility on his teenage shoulders.

41
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:51,975
他必须独自忍受沙漠的盛怒
He must endure the fury of the desert alone,

42
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:55,015
但前方  更大的挑战在等着他
but there's an even bigger challenge ahead.

43
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:01,095
他在与地球上最大的陆地动物赛跑
He's in a race against the biggest land animal on earth--

44
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,375
非洲象
African elephants.

45
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,295
它们同样渴望得到水的滋润
This desert herd is also desperate for water

46
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,695
因为全马里都深陷干旱的魔爪
because Mali is gripped by drought.

47
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,255
这里有40摄氏度
It's 40 degrees Celsius.

48
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,575
大部分水坑均已干涸
Most of the water holes are already dry.

49
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:23,735
只有80公里外的一个地方仍会有水
Only one place for 80 kilometres will still have water--

50
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,415
斑泽纳湖
Lake Banzena.

51
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:32,455
这里就是非洲象和玛玛杜的目的地
And this is where both the elephants and Mamadou are heading.

52
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,465
我必须在大象之前...

53
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:42,985
...赶到湖边

54
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:48,275
如果它们先到达  我的牛就只能吃泥了

55
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,455
如果玛玛杜保持快速行进
If Mamadou keeps up a fast pace,

56
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:53,495
他就会在天亮时分到达湖边
he'll reach the lake by morning.

57
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,455
但就在他身后50公里的地方
But only 50 kilometres behind him

58
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:59,335
沙漠族群中最大的游牧族也在蠢蠢欲动
are the greatest nomads of the desert.

59
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:05,295
母象族长带领着象群
Elephant matriarchs guide the herd,

60
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:08,775
循着方圆几百几千公里内
following an incredible mental map of all the water holes

61
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,145
由诸多水坑标记的奇妙记忆地图
to be found in an area

62
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,655
向湖边进发
of tens of thousands of square kilometres.

63
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:17,255
刺槐树为它们的旅途提供了充足的供给
Acacia trees give them just enough fuel to keep walking,

64
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:21,015
但它们不能停息  必须日夜行进
but they can't rest, day or night.

65
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,765
但是对于玛玛杜来说
But, for Mamadou,

66
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:29,175
黑夜令他别无选择  只能停歇
nightfall means he has no choice but to stop.

67
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,855
在黑暗中遇上象群是致命的
Meeting elephants in the dark could be fatal.

68
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,695
玛玛杜从奶牛那挤出几丝珍贵的牛奶
A hurried breakfast is the little precious milk

69
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,615
凑成了一顿匆忙的早餐
Mamadou can get from his cows.

70
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:47,415
这可以暂时防止他脱水
It keeps him one step away from dehydration.

71
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,655
但他必须得前进了
But he's got to get going.

72
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,445
象群走了一夜
The elephant herd have walked through the night,

73
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,575
渐渐逼近
making up ground.

74
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:15,015
终于  湖水映入了玛玛杜的眼帘
Finally the end is in sight for Mamadou.

75
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:20,425
但麻烦正等着他
But he walks straight into trouble.

76
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:24,135
庞大的象群不仅先他一步到达湖边
Not only have the massive elephant herd beaten him to the lake,

77
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,735
还堵住了他前进寻水的道路
but they're also blocking his access to the water.

78
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:40,815
玛玛杜深知万象奔腾的威力
Mamadou knows the elephants could charge,

79
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:43,095
所以他很小心  不过于接近象群
so he is careful not to get too close.

80
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,775
冲突一触即发
It's an uneasy truce

81
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,335
同时他还要想出突破重围的办法
while he works out how to break through.

82
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,495
突然间  一头大象向他的牛群冲去
Suddenly an elephant charges his cows.

83
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,375
玛玛杜给予了反击  但他只有树枝可用
Mamadou fights back, but armed only with sticks,

84
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,815
这简直就是大卫和歌利亚之间的战斗
it's a battle of David and Goliath.

85
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,815
出自《旧约》:  歌利亚是巨人  大卫为了奖赏与之搏杀

86
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:34,815
玛玛杜鼓起勇气赶走了五十多头大象
Mamadou's courage has managed to shift over 50 elephants.

87
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:44,375
幸运的是  这样的情况极少
Luckily, conflicts like this are very rare.

88
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:48,725
大象被口渴逼疯了...

89
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,645
就像我们一样

90
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,055
终于  玛玛杜赶着他的牛群
Finally Mamadou drives his cattle

91
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:59,105
走向这生命之水
towards the life-giving water.

92
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:14,695
象群离开  去寻找这片湖中自己的领域
The elephants move off and find their own part of the lake.

93
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:20,575
最终  它们也饮上了水
At last, they too have an opportunity to drink...

94
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:24,135
甚至玩耍起来
and even play.

95
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:39,215
两个月内将没有雨水填满那些水坑
It will be two months before there's any chance of rain replenishing the water holes,

96
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,735
所以玛玛杜还得继续奋斗
so Mamadou's struggles will go on.

97
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,775
但在沙漠的一隅
But in one part of the desert,

98
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,695
水源的吃紧却带来了意外之喜
a shrinking water supply leads to a surprising opportunity.

99
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:01,175
几百公里开外  沿着邦贾加拉峭壁
Hundreds of kilometres away, along the Bandiagara escarpment,

100
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,735
40度的热浪袭来
the sapping 40-degree heat has sucked the life

101
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,295
夺走了多贡河的生机
out of the rivers of Dogon country,

102
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:09,495
只留下孤零零的水坑
leaving only isolated pools

103
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,655
满是搁浅的鱼
stuffed with stranded fish.

104
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:16,815
多贡人将此时定为沙漠捕鱼节
The Dogon choose this moment for a desert fishing festival.

105
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:28,375
上千名竞争者被吸引到安图果湖
Thousands of competitors are drawn to Lake Antogo,

106
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:33,055
其中包括迪亚罗  他30年来  一直来这
including Dialo, who's been coming here for 30 years.

107
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:36,135
能抓到鱼对他来说是一种荣耀
It's a matter of pride for him to catch a fish.

108
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,855
来这里的人都想抓到鱼

109
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,635
...所以竞争很激烈

110
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,945
虽然没法保证  但我会尽力抓一两条鱼

111
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,995
如果成功了  我会十分欣慰

112
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,575
在其它任何日子里
On any other day,

113
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:54,815
捕鱼在这片神圣水域是严令禁止的
fishing is strictly forbidden in this sacred water.

114
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,855
久而久之  那些长者就为旱季贮存下了
In this way, the elders protect an important food reserve

115
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
重要的食物储备
well into the dry season.

116
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,055
但今日  这个群落有机会
But today the community

117
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:10,465
收获一顿"最后的晚餐"
have a chance to catch a symbolic last supper.

118
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:16,415
河岸很快就挤满了人
The banks are filling up quickly.

119
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,565
气氛很紧张
The atmosphere is tense.

120
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:30,345
迪亚罗已经找到一处好位置
Dialo has found a good spot.

121
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,185
但现在他必须等待
But now he must wait

122
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:36,865
因为安图果有自己不成文的规定
since Antogo has its own unwritten rules.

123
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:48,185
仪式酋长摇首颂祷  以驱散妖魔鬼怪
The ceremonial chief chants a prayer to chase away evil spirits.

124
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,485
他头罩鱼篓
He wears a fish trap,

125
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,305
相信这样能保护脱口而出的祷词
believed to protect the words as they are spoken.

126
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:57,775
这是迪亚罗一年一遇的机会
This is Dialo's once-a-year chance.

127
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:25,495
自由的捕鱼人迅速乱做了一团
The free-for-all quickly becomes a fishing frenzy.

128
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:42,455
他们将鱼篓猛塞进湖底抓鱼
They thrust their baskets down to trap the fish.

129
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,315
迪亚罗已经逮到了一条
Dialo has caught one,

130
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,715
但现在顾不得什么绅士礼节
but there's no time for politeness.

131
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,715
嘿  这是我的地盘

132
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,175
仅仅过了15分钟  湖里就一干二净了
After just 15 minutes, there's nothing left,

133
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,255
混乱渐渐平息
and the chaos subsides.

134
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,615
迪亚罗成功了  但也已精疲力尽
Dialo is successful, but exhausted.

135
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,895
回到家  他那傲人的收获
Back at home, his proud catch of fish

136
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,365
成了全家人最后的饕餮
becomes a final feast for his family

137
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,555
这样他们就能熬过旱季的尾巴
so they can survive the last days of the dry season.

138
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:01,645
当你抓到鱼  你就会感到那幸福之门

139
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,615
...为你和你的家人打开

140
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:19,215
用尽各种寻路绝技  才找的到水源
it takes immense navigational skill just to find water.

141
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:24,295
这些图布女人
These Tubu women must

142
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,765
必须冒险穿过浩瀚的撒哈拉沙海
venture across the vast sand seas of the Sahara

143
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:32,855
去寻找只有一平米见方的小井
in search of a miniature well just one metre square.

144
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,735
它意味着生与死的差别
It will mean the difference between life and death.

145
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:58,145
他们管这里叫泰内雷  不毛之地
They call this place the Tenere-- the land of nothing.

146
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:03,215
这里四无一物  炙热撩人  危机遍布
It is featureless, scorching and unreliable.

147
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,885
来自图布的菲尼
Foni is a Tubu woman who can

148
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,955
可以在没有地图或指针的情况下找到水源
find her way to water without a map or a compass.

149
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,795
我从小就来往与这条路线

150
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,955
这是全世界最艰难的一条路

151
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:22,695
她还带着她年仅十岁的女儿  莎黛
She's brought her daughter, Shede, only ten years old.

152
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,095
他们还要走上三天才能到达所寻之井
The well they seek is still three days' walk away.

153
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:30,615
这将是他们一起面对的最艰苦卓绝的旅程
This is the toughest journey they'll ever face together.

154
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:34,575
两个人死了  他们没找到井

155
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,895
我们向上帝祈求保护

156
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:44,215
他们肩负着这趟涉险寻食之旅
They undertake this perilous journey for food.

157
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:48,695
他们必须穿越240公里到达集市
They must cross 240 kilometres just to get to market

158
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:52,975
卖掉骆驼以换取六个月的供给
to trade camels for supplies that will last them six months.

159
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:57,495
这支队伍只有女人和小孩
This caravan is only women and children,

160
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:02,095
因为在图布  女人是认路能手
since, for the Tubu, it's the women who are the great navigators.

161
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:09,245
在没经验的肉眼看来
To the untrained eye,

162
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,415
沙丘就是一座沙丘
a dune is just a dune.

163
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,585
但菲尼可辨别出
But Foni can tell which ones

164
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:17,215
这变幻之地中的安全岛
to trust in a place where nothing stands still.

165
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:23,535
小一点的沙丘变幻着形状  随风而动
Smaller dunes shape-shift, moving with the wind,

166
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,815
隐藏着许多危机
making them unreliable.

167
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:31,145
但大一点的沙丘  堆积了60多米
But larger dunes, towering over 60 metres,

168
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,495
更加稳固  可供旅人对沙漠管中窥豹一番
are more stable, revealing signs of a much bigger picture.

169
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:40,515
几千年来  沙漠中的狂风
Over thousands of years, prevailing desert winds

170
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:44,535
将沙丘吹成平行的长沙脊
have blown dunes into long, parallel ridges,

171
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,695
它是旅人们可辨认的唯一地标
the only landmarks for the travellers.

172
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,415
图布人以观察太阳和脊线
The Tubu look to the sun and

173
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:55,415
来辨别该朝哪个方向走
the ridge line to work out which direction to go.

174
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:59,485
然后清点脊线的数目来看走了多远
Then they count each ridge to know how far they've gone.

175
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,975
他们已在焦阳下走了十个小时
They've been walking for ten hours in the blazing sun.

176
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:13,975
得歇一歇了
They must rest.

177
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,295
他们用一张床单扎营
They make their camp out of a single sheet,

178
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:26,215
并分配饮水
and ration their water.

179
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:32,325
骆驼的水里参夹了燕麦
The camels' share is mixed with oats,

180
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,735
女人则喝甜茶
while the women drink sweet tea.

181
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:43,185
菲尼  我们今天走了多少路

182
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:47,235
33个沙丘

183
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:52,545
没错  我掰手指数过

184
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:12,405
他们要赶在日头最盛前早起
They rise early, before the sun gets too hot.

185
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:17,175
他们只带了到达水井所必须的水
They only carry enough water to get to the well,

186
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:20,295
所以速度至关重要
so the pace they travel is key.

187
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,535
熟悉这方面沙漠知识的专家早已消失
This specialist understanding of the desert is fast disappearing.

188
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:33,055
现如今只有几百个图布妇女了解这些知识
Today only a few hundred Tubu women possess the knowledge.

189
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:38,095
菲尼相信把这些知识传授给莎黛
Foni believes that by teaching Shede

190
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,495
那知识就能代代流传  惠及后代
she can keep it alive for another generation.

191
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:46,825
莎黛听好  在到达水井前要经过八个山脊

192
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:51,795
当到达第九个时  你会看见一个灌木丛

193
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:56,295
水井就在第十个山脊后面

194
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,075
而当黑夜逐渐来临
When darkness falls,

195
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:07,475
菲尼就会教莎黛解读夜晚的天空
Foni also teaches Shede how to read the night sky.

196
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,065
那就是北极星

197
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,775
如果北极星一直在我们身后

198
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,935
...我们总会找到水井的

199
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:27,295
至少目前她们清楚方向是对的
For now, at least, they know they're on the right path.

200
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:34,375
今天是第三天
It's day three.

201
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,575
她们必须在今天之内找到水井
Today they must find the well.

202
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:42,615
收拾铺盖时  菲尼决定让莎黛来负责寻找水井
While packing up, Foni decides Shede is ready to take charge.

203
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,205
但水井十分隐蔽  即使只相距几百米
But the well is so hidden that even if she's

204
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:52,725
她也可能一不小心错过了
only a few hundred metres away, she could miss it.

205
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:01,165
她们朝着正确的方向出发
She sets them off in the right direction, aligning herself

206
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,795
走在山脊中间  朝着日出向东前进
between the ridges ahead and the sunrise to the east.

207
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,375
对像莎黛这样十来岁年纪的孩子来说
For some children Shede's age, just ten years old,

208
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,215
认准去学校的路已经不易
finding their way to school is challenge enough.

209
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,015
但是莎黛必须在这全世界最荒芜的地方
But Shede has to find her way

210
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:21,255
走上20公里找到目的地
20 miles across the bleakest landscape on Earth.

211
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,455
我一个人肯定吓死了

212
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,255
但有了妈妈的经验指导
But with her mother's guiding words echoing in her head,

213
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:32,695
她勇敢向前
she strides forward.

214
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:38,795
在繁重又辛苦的12小时之行后
After a gruelling 12-hours' riding,

215
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:41,935
第十个山脊终于近在眼前
the tenth ridge is finally in sight.

216
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:47,035
沙丘凹陷处的那一丛灌木
The lonely bush in the dip of the dune

217
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,085
是有水井那个溪谷的标志
marks the valley of the well.

218
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,215
就在那儿

219
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,065
就在那儿了

220
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,795
井在那

221
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:05,535
莎黛找到了80公里范围内唯一一个水井
Shede has found the only well for 80 kilometres around.

222
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,375
她的母亲为她自豪
She's made her mum proud.

223
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,095
终于  莎黛可以给骆驼喂水了
Finally, Shede can water the camels.

224
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,295
解决口渴问题之后  她洗了个澡
With their thirst quenched, she washes off three days of dust.

225
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,815
她们已经找到了水  接下来要运去市场
Now they've got water, they'll make it to market,

226
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:43,455
但离这次旅途的结束还有好几星期
but they're still weeks away from finishing their journey.

227
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:51,455
并非所有沙漠都酷热难当
Not all deserts are swelteringly hot.

228
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:56,615
蒙古的戈壁就代表了两个极端
The Gobi in Mongolia is a desert of extremes.

229
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:59,375
在距赤道遥远的北方
Lying far north of the equator,

230
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:04,355
炎夏的炼狱转瞬间就能变成北极的冰窖
here scorching summer highs plunge to freezing Arctic lows.

231
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:10,215
现在是二月份  零下20摄氏度
It's February, minus 20 degrees Celsius,

232
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:13,695
人们仅有的几个水井已经被冻住了
and the few wells people have are frozen over.

233
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:20,935
但是  雪是另一种形态的水
But, amazingly, water appears here as snow.

234
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,135
这里并不下雪
The snow doesn't fall here.

235
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:28,975
雪是从离这3000多公里的西伯利亚吹过来的
It's blown over 3,000 kilometres from Siberia.

236
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:32,655
而这些刺骨寒风从不消停
And these bitter winds mean it never settles for long.

237
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:40,665
所以冈包勒德和他的双驼峰
So Ganbold and his twin-humped Bactrian camels

238
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:44,325
必须循着雪花  向着它们所属的山脉赶去
must chase the snow towards the mountains where it lingers.

239
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,855
这珍贵的雪就是一条生命线
This rare snow is a lifeline.

240
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:50,845
雪即家人

241
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:53,545
滋养着兽群

242
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,445
事关重要  他和家人
It's so important, he and his family

243
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:01,385
已在山麓丘陵驻扎好营寨
have set up their winter camp in the foothills.

244
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,895
但这是一步险招
But he's taking a risk.

245
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,615
他的牧群  包括已经怀孕的雌兽
His herd, including pregnant females,

246
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:13,935
正处在沙漠肉食动物的窥视范围之内
are now in the hunting grounds of a voracious desert predator,

247
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:18,175
而它们的最爱  便是刚出生的骆驼幼仔
and they like nothing better than newborn camel flesh.

248
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:24,305
不能让骆驼长时间饮雪

249
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:31,875
狼群虎视眈眈

250
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:38,655
戈壁沙漠的狼群在几千公里范围内徘徊觅食
Gobi desert wolves roam over thousands of kilometres.

251
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,345
敏锐的触觉
Their keen sense of smell

252
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,175
能帮助他们追踪千里之外的猎物
helps them shadow the herds at a distance.

253
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,745
一旦冈包勒德稍有放松  它们就会发动袭击
If Ganbold drops his guard, they'll attack.

254
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,305
回到营地后
He returns to camp to hear

255
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:57,045
他得知自己的儿子已经阻止了一次狼群的袭击
that his son has interrupted a wolf attack.

256
00:22:57,515 --> 00:22:59,405
它们杀死了一只羊
One sheep has been killed.

257
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:07,855
狼是贪婪的动物

258
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:14,435
来了一次  就会来第二次

259
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:24,055
暮色四合  沙尘暴开始肆虐
As evening falls, an icy dust storm builds.

260
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:41,255
狼群是温暖的帐篷中唯一的话题
In the warm tent, wolves are the only topic of conversation.

261
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:47,445
一旦狼抓住骆驼幼仔...

262
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:51,575
就咬断脖子  一击毙命

263
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:00,815
还喜欢在恶劣的天气干这些卑鄙勾当

264
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:11,675
午夜时分  冈包勒德最后一次检查了怀孕的骆驼
At midnight, Ganbold checks his pregnant camels one last time.

265
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:17,455
怎么只剩八只了

266
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:22,855
他突然意识到有雌骆驼失踪了
He suddenly realises his prize female is missing

267
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:26,495
但此刻风暴肆虐  只有等天亮才能去找
but, with the storm, they can't look for her until daylight.

268
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:49,335
天已经破晓  他们出发去寻找
Come dawn, the search is on to find out what has become of

269
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,185
那只母骆驼和它未出生的幼仔
her and her unborn calf.

270
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,145
走

271
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,815
别担心  我们会找到它的

272
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:07,735
冈包勒德召集了他的朋友
Ganbold musters his friends.

273
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:11,055
这是一场人类和狼群的较量
It's a race between them and the wolves.

274
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:18,535
他们发现了踪迹
They find tracks.

275
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:20,395
有只狼从这经过

276
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:26,715
冈包勒德走上最高的山脊
Ganbold heads to the highest ridge,

277
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:29,695
他对搜寻的规模也有了数
and the scale of his task becomes clear.

278
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:34,235
狼能辨别...

279
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:37,795
...孰强孰弱

280
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,095
发现了更多刚留下的足迹
More fresh tracks.

281
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:49,735
狼  是狼

282
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:00,845
我的枪有点晃

283
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:02,585
真是狡猾的动物

284
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,145
就差一点

285
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:07,885
真希望能抓住它

286
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,295
他们已经看到了敌人
They've seen off the enemy,

287
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,055
但是骆驼在附近吗
but is the camel nearby?

288
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:20,815
最后  他们隐约看到了骆驼的轮廓
Finally, they see a shape.

289
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:28,575
冈包勒德心爱的骆驼还活着
Ganbold's beloved camel is alive.

290
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:31,095
她已经产下了幼仔
And she's given birth.

291
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,935
骆驼幼仔还不能走动
But the calf isn't moving.

292
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:52,255
让他欣慰的是  幼仔还有呼吸
To his great relief, the calf is breathing.

293
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:07,325
所有人都会为小骆驼感到自豪

294
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,495
看样子还是站不起来

295
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:16,285
生出才几小时的骆驼是没法走回营地的
Only a few hours old, the calf is too weak to walk back to camp.

296
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,575
所以冈包勒德捎了它一程
So Ganbold gives it a lift.

297
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,825
他的儿子立刻跑出来帮忙
His son rushes out to help

298
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:33,145
其他孩子也凑过来围观这位新成员
and his other boys meet the latest addition to the herd.

299
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:40,815
冈包勒德为自己的好运感恩
Ganbold gives thanks for his good fortune.

300
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:51,585
不像戈壁  有些沙漠是与水无缘的
Unlike the Gobi, there are some deserts where water never exists.

301
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,695
在智利的阿塔卡马沙漠
In the Chilean Atacama desert,

302
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:59,575
有些地方就似火星表面一样荒芜
some areas are as desolate as the surface of Mars.

303
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,695
这是地球上最干燥的地方
This is the driest place on Earth.

304
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:08,625
这里的人们受大自然启发
Here people have been inspired

305
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:12,335
从稀薄的空气里祈求水源
by nature to conjure water from thin air.

306
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:18,315
南美洲的一种野生骆驼  驼马
Cactus flowers are a source of food for the guanacos,

307
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,495
以仙人掌花为食
the wild camels of South America.

308
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:27,895
这些仙人掌也是它们的饮水之源
But these cacti are also the key to their water supply.

309
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:29,985
它们被毛茸茸的青苔所覆盖
They're covered in furry lichen,

310
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:32,805
青苔会吸收空气中的湿气
which traps any moisture in the air.

311
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:39,055
奥兰多从仙人掌处获得了启发
Orlando has taken inspiration from the cacti's natural solution.

312
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,585
他和朋友一起竖起了一张六米高的大网
With his friends, he erects a vast net six metres high.

313
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:50,675
用力拉  查理

314
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:05,675
网的网眼就好比青苔的毛须
The net's mesh is designed to mimic the lichen hairs,

315
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:09,355
在阿塔卡马的的沿海地带
because in this coastal strip of the Atacama desert

316
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:13,815
太平洋的水气便是他们的生命线
they have a lifeline to moisture- the Pacific Ocean.

317
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:21,195
冰冷的洋流冷却了沙漠的空气
Here, cold sea currents cool the hot desert air

318
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:24,055
并氤氲出大雾
and produce huge fog blankets.

319
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,615
雾漂上岸
The fog is sucked ashore...

320
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,355
掠过仙人掌
..and sweeps over the cacti...

321
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:43,565
和奥兰多的网
..and also Orlando's nets.

322
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:52,355
当雾接触到仙人掌  就会在青苔的毛须上凝聚
When the fog hits the cacti, it condenses onto the lichen hairs,

323
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:54,535
这就获得了珍贵的水
which capture the precious water.

324
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:02,335
很快  仙人掌上就有露水滴下来
In no time, the cacti are dripping with dew.

325
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:12,255
在网上  也会发生同样的进程
On the nets, the fog does exactly the same.

326
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,855
一滴接一滴
Drop by precious drop,

327
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,335
水就奇迹般地流入了蓄水池
this miracle water is channelled to a reservoir.

328
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:28,115
别人看到我们

329
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:30,285
每天上山取水...

330
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,945
...都认为我们疯了

331
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,445
查理  快看  有这么多水

332
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,645
这些神奇的网
Each day, these magical nets

333
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,285
每天能产生将近500公升的水
produce nearly 500 litres of water...

334
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:54,455
使得奥兰多能在沙子里种植些植物
..which allows Orlando to nurture a few plants in the sand.

335
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,725
但他另有宏图
But he has bigger ideas.

336
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:06,165
我梦想为部落从天上取水

337
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,415
黄沙漫漫  这仅仅是人类
This is just the latest innovation

338
00:31:09,415 --> 00:31:13,415
在追寻水源的无尽道路上的又一次创新
in the eternal human quest to find water in the desert.

339
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:21,335
纵观世界  蚀痕雕刻了每一处地貌
Around the world, signs are etched in the landscape.

340
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,895
痕迹表明了哪曾有水流过
Scars show where water used to flow.

341
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:28,925
七千年前  撒哈拉沙漠中
7,000 years ago, the Sahara

342
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:31,745
遍布纵横交错的江河湖水
was crossed by a network of rivers and lakes,

343
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:34,455
而现在已悉数消失  演变成了沙漠
which disappeared as it turned to desert.

344
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:39,595
但现如今在这不毛之地  有些水源
Yet, in this now barren land, some of this water remains

345
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:42,375
依旧深深藏在地下的岩石中
deep in rocks underground.

346
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:49,775
在阿尔及利亚中部的巴阿马
In Ba'amar, central Algeria,

347
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,895
开发这些古老的水源是人们的独门绝技
their extraordinary skill is to tap into this ancient water.

348
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:58,455
但你必须知道怎么利用它
But you have to know how to harness it.

349
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:05,135
马佛笛今年70岁  一生都献给了沙漠里
Mafourdi is 70 years old, and committed to a life in the desert.

350
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,405
我们祈求上帝的帮助

351
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:15,595
早晨祷告完毕以后  他就出发寻找水源
Every morning after prayer, the men head off to find water.

352
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,425
带着坚定的信念
With stubborn devotion

353
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:24,795
以及简单的工具  他们凿出了一口井
and very simple tools, they have dug a well.

354
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:28,835
花了六个月的时间
It's taken them six months

355
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:31,895
他们才在沙漠中开凿出一口井
to carve out a shaft through the desert rock.

356
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:35,495
现在他们已经为这个最危险的任务做好了准备
Only now are they ready for their most dangerous mission.

357
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:43,085
作为年纪最大  经验最丰富的人
As the oldest and the most experienced,

358
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:45,175
马佛笛独自降入井中
Mafourdi climbs down alone.

359
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:48,335
一条九米深的垂直深井
It's a sheer nine-metre drop.

360
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:21,655
井底挖出了一条齐膝水道
At the bottom lies knee-deep water in hand-dug passages.

361
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,865
马佛笛深知维持水源的流动性的重要
Mafourdi knows they are vital to keep the water supply flowing.

362
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:28,585
但有太多人由于水道崩塌
But many men have been buried

363
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,695
而被活埋于此
alive down here when the walls have collapsed.

364
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:38,135
这些水均从岩石中渗出
The water seeps from the rocks themselves.

365
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:41,715
在石头中封存了千年的水
Mafourdi has released it

366
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:44,615
都被马佛笛释放了出来
from thousands of years trapped in the rock.

367
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:48,685
古时曾流淌在这上方的河流
This ancient water is all that's left of the

368
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:51,705
留下了这些远古的液滴
rivers that used to flow across the land above.

369
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:55,125
这口井对我们来说意味着生命

370
00:33:56,435 --> 00:34:01,105
来自于水的生命是圣洁的

371
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:05,695
但是一口井还远远不够
But one well isn't enough.

372
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,455
最好的计策就是将几口井打通
The real trick is to connect several wells

373
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:11,855
造出一个地下水道
and create an underground channel of water.

374
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,565
马佛笛的邻居阿卜杜拉
Mafourdi's neighbour, Abdullah,

375
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:22,655
前半年也曾挖出一口井
has also been digging a well for the last six months.

376
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,595
就在今天  他们要打通两口井
Today's the day they're going to join up.

377
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,685
能听到我讲话吗

378
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,155
快打通了

379
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:33,605
快了  快了

380
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,615
能听到我讲话吗

381
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:37,975
能  当然能

382
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:40,775
但是阿卜杜拉必须把马佛笛独自留在此
But Abdullah must leave Mafourdi.

383
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:44,335
连通水道无疑是最危险的环节
Joining the tunnels is the most dangerous part.

384
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,165
拉上去

385
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:49,025
挖出了这么多泥石
With so much earth removed,

386
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:51,695
30英尺的岩石随时可能崩塌
30 foot of rock could collapse at any moment.

387
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:54,935
如果崩塌了  马佛笛必死无疑
It would crush Mafourdi, with no hope of escape.

388
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:04,475
回到地面后  阿卜杜拉诚心为马佛笛祷告
Back at the surface, Abdullah prays for Mafourdi.

389
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:07,545
愿真主护佑他

390
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:09,935
愿真主护佑他

391
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,205
愿先知穆罕默德赐福

392
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:34,045
最终  马佛笛将两条水道打通了
Finally, Mafourdi has broken through.

393
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,825
但是井壁能支撑住吗
But will the walls hold?

394
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:58,625
欢迎回来  真主阿拉保佑你

395
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:05,005
现在它跟另一口井已经连通了

396
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:10,615
这条新隧道组成了一个更大的供水系统
This new channel is just part of a much bigger system.

397
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,415
700年来  一代一代的人
Every generation for the last 700 years

398
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:16,815
在这不停开凿新井  连通水道
has been digging new wells and connecting them up.

399
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:23,655
现在这里已经有800多口井
There are over 800 wells here now,

400
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:27,695
沙漠之下已有60公里长的水道
channelling water 60 kilometres under the desert floor.

401
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,725
水流在开凿的水道中
The passages are cut so that

402
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:36,165
缓缓沿着下坡流动
the water continually runs slightly downhill.

403
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,135
当它抵达了平地  就会分流至各个村庄
When it reaches the surface, it's divided up

404
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,345
在水的滋养下  村庄才得以安康
to sustain a village that otherwise wouldn't exist.

405
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,375
马佛笛利用他的那份水源
With his share of the water,

406
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,935
发展起一个绿洲来种植海枣
Mafourdi has created an oasis to grow date palms.

407
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:05,095
这一创举吸引了无数好奇的游客
And this attracts all sorts of surprising visitors.

408
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,855
一看见花园  我就喜从心来

409
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:15,325
它激励我努力为此劳作

410
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:22,515
一旦有了用之不竭的水源  没有什么是不可能的
Once you have a permanent water supply, anything's possible.

411
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,815
在美国内华达州
In America's state of Nevada,

412
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:31,585
拉斯维加斯将沙漠生存推向了一个极致
Las Vegas pushes desert living to the extreme.

413
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:35,735
它打破了一切常规
It breaks all the rules.

414
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:38,095
它是美国成长最迅速的城市之一
It is one of the fastest growing cities in the US,

415
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,905
个人用水量
using more water per person

416
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,075
几乎比全球任何地方都高
than almost anywhere else in the world.

417
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:47,175
人类真的实现了一个不可能的梦想吗
Is this humanity realising an impossible dream?

418
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,645
或者它只是一道霓虹  稍纵即逝
Or is it just a neon mirage?

419
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:57,255
人类文明蓬勃而起
The deserts of the world are

420
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:00,485
又因水源的枯竭而消亡
littered with ruins of boom-and-bust civilisations

421
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:02,375
最后便留下了一片沙海
where the water ran out.

422
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,715
佩特拉是约旦古代的一个城市
Petra in Jordan was an ancient city

423
00:38:07,915 --> 00:38:09,845
曾经的水渠系统可以在一天内
which once had an aqueduct system

424
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:14,695
向2万人供应4亿公升的水
delivering 40 million litres of water a day to 20,000 people.

425
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:24,995
对大多数沙漠居民来说
For most desert dwellers,

426
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:28,515
贫乏的雨水便是生活所有的期盼
life revolves around the meagre rains.

427
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:33,505
雨水是熬过下一个炎年的希望
Only with rain can they hope to survive the next blazing year.

428
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:38,725
但在马里  绝不可轻信沙漠之雨
But in Mali, desert rains are anything but reliable.

429
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,655
也许一连几年  滴雨未下
Some years, they don't come at all.

430
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:52,895
但一旦下起来  村民也知道会是狂风暴雨
If they do, the villagers know they come violently,

431
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:55,525
所以粮仓得都做好防水准备
so they must make their granaries watertight.

432
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:05,735
大雨总是紧随沙尘暴接踵而来
The rains are preceded by sandstorms,

433
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:08,035
所以现在人们望着天
so now people watch the skies,

434
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:10,855
等待一场咆哮的沙暴
waiting for a rampaging wall of dust.

435
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,445
50公里宽
At 50 kilometres wide, and

436
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:24,505
前进时速达100公里的沙暴
advancing at a speed of 100 kilometres an hour,

437
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,595
迅速吞噬了整个村庄
the sandstorm engulfs the village in minutes.

438
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,975
但人们都知道这黑压压的一片是个好兆头
But people know this darkness is ultimately a good sign.

439
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:12,975
最终大雨倾泻而下
Finally the rain is unleashed.

440
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,605
短短20分钟达到的15厘米的降雨量
15 centimetres falls in 20 minutes,

441
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:19,855
让沙漠变成了溪流密布的网络
turning the desert into a network of streams.

442
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:29,235
一整年的等待  在这一刻化作了喜悦
Having waited all year, it's suddenly a moment to rejoice.

443
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:11,535
雨水改变着全世界每一片沙漠的景致
In deserts across the world, rains transform the landscape.

444
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,135
这一刻
This is the one moment when

445
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:20,255
生活不再为水源发愁
life is no longer about the quest for water.

446
00:41:20,255 --> 00:41:22,415
压力消失了
The pressure's off.

447
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:31,895
对西非尼日尔的沃达贝人来说
For the Wodaabe people of Niger, West Africa,

448
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:35,335
这是他们求偶的最佳时机
this is their window of opportunity for love.

449
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,695
雨水丰沛的时候
When the rains are good enough,

450
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:47,055
他们能从孤立的生活中解脱出来
they can abandon their normally isolated lives.

451
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:50,575
在充足的食物及水的供应下  上百号沃达贝人
There's enough food and water to support a few hundred Wodaabe

452
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:54,615
聚集到一起  参加一场世上罕见的聚会
coming together for one of the most extraordinary gatherings

453
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:57,495
一场传宗接代的盛会
of fertility and flirtation in the world.

454
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:04,375
在这一派繁忙的景象之下
In this hive of activity is Djao.

455
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,305
迪吉奥步行了80公里
He's walked 80 kilometres

456
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:09,375
来参加一场格瑞沃尔的比赛
to be here for a contest called Gerewol.

457
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:13,415
这是一种两性之间的求偶舞蹈
It's a courtship dance for sex.

458
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:17,415
赢就意味着他将赢得一位情人
Winning means he'll get a new lover.

459
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:21,675
跳格瑞沃就是为了赢得一位情人...

460
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:25,415
哪怕这意味着抢别人的老婆

461
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:32,565
你可以娶她或云雨一番

462
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:36,805
今年很特别
This year is special.

463
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:40,465
这是六年大旱后第一次举办格瑞沃尔比赛
It's the first Gerewol after six years of drought,

464
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:43,145
所以大家都兴致高昂
so expectations are running high.

465
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:51,145
迪吉奥已经结婚了  他的妻子笛贝也在场
Djao is already married, and his wife Tembe is here, too.

466
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:55,055
事实上  这场庆典上到处都是已婚夫妻
Indeed, this festival is full of married couples.

467
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,975
沃达贝文化允许人们
Wodaabe culture allows both men and women

468
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,995
在这几天可以不顾结婚誓言
to set aside their marriage vows

469
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,895
并且不用为此感到耻辱
without stigma for these few days.

470
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:07,895
笛贝期待一场鱼水之欢
Tembe is up for a fling herself.

471
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:15,935
我已经发现了三个中意的男人了

472
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:21,615
但是她知道她的丈夫也是红人
But she knows her husband is also a great catch.

473
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:25,515
迪吉奥又帅又高...

474
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,945
...唱一嗓子好歌

475
00:43:28,225 --> 00:43:30,385
身段性感

476
00:43:34,665 --> 00:43:37,635
所以我才选择了他

477
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:44,495
但是这场调情比赛  女人才是评审
But, for this flirting contest, it's the women who choose

478
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:48,655
更令人称奇的是  男人们都化上了妆
and, surprisingly, the men who dress up.

479
00:43:56,495 --> 00:44:00,575
迪吉奥的美貌  舞蹈和歌唱实力将被仔细审查
Djao's beauty, dancing and singing will be scrutinised.

480
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,665
几个小时后就是他的演出了
His big performance is just hours away.

481
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,085
我正在化妆...

482
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,625
因为我想赢得一个姑娘

483
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,835
男人们用彩色粘土
The men decorate themselves

484
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:16,375
装饰自己
with coloured clays from the desert...

485
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,985
用烧焦的白鹭骨头粉末
..With the crushed, charred bones of egrets

486
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:23,735
做唇彩涂唇
for their black lipstick,

487
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:26,845
抹上沙漠植物制作的香水
and with perfumes from desert plants

488
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:29,295
让他们的魅力更加无法抵挡
to make themselves irresistible.

489
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:34,855
该迪吉奥上场随乐起舞了
It's time for Djao to face the music.

490
00:44:52,175 --> 00:44:57,095
女人们正在仔细挑选着男人
The men come under close scrutiny from an opinionated crowd.

491
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:08,535
一行舞者离开后  迪吉奥登场了
As one line of dancers leave, Djao steps into the arena.

492
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:12,135
他渴望获得三位评委的青睐
He's desperate to be chosen by one of the three girl judges

493
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:13,855
然后共赴云雨
for a night of desert passion.

494
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:23,535
女人们逐项审查着
The girls are looking for specific things.

495
00:45:23,535 --> 00:45:27,375
他必须如白鹭般沉稳
He must keep great poise, like an egret.

496
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,795
展示他的牙齿
He must show his teeth,

497
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:31,375
一展歌喉
flutter his lips and sing from his throat.

498
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,495
还要在有限的时间内翩翩起舞
He must dance in time

499
00:45:33,495 --> 00:45:37,215
并靠肩膀与左右对齐
and use his shoulders to keep his position in the line.

500
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:51,835
那个男人很帅

501
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,615
迪吉奥有了压力
The pressure's on for Djao.

502
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:11,255
任何一个小疏忽  都会让他七年的等待付之流水
Any slip now, and he'll lose what he's waited seven years for.

503
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:23,015
五个小时以后  答案就要揭晓
After five hours, it's the moment of truth.

504
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:31,455
三位评审选出了她们心目中的冠军
All three judges approach to choose their champions.

505
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:41,495
第一位评委走到他们面前
The first walks up the line

506
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:46,175
不经意的一个手势  便选出了心中的白马王子
and, with a subtle gesture, indicates the man of her dreams.

507
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:53,135
但她没选迪吉奥
But she doesn't choose Djao.

508
00:46:55,095 --> 00:46:57,815
第二位也没选
Neither does the second.

509
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:04,095
第三位还是没选
Nor the third.

510
00:47:06,895 --> 00:47:08,975
迪吉奥失去了机会
Djao has missed his chance.

511
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:12,615
他尽了最大的努力却无法赢得一位情人
His best efforts weren't enough to win a lover.

512
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,035
至少得再等上一年
It'll be at least a year

513
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:19,135
才有机会再次参加比赛了
before he has the opportunity to dance again.

514
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:30,535
笛贝在找迪吉奥
Tembe is looking for Djao.

515
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:35,175
许多速配的夫妇开始了约会
Many new couples are hanging out,

516
00:47:35,175 --> 00:47:38,895
但至少迪吉奥和笛贝还拥有彼此
but at least Djao and Tembe still have each other.

517
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:43,335
你爱我  才会为我编头发

518
00:47:47,815 --> 00:47:50,075
男人女人们都离开了
So the men and women disperse,

519
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,775
有新欢  也有旧爱
some with new lovers, some with old,

520
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:58,015
每一个人都在返回隔绝的沙漠中前
but all have been touched by the flush of fertility and community

521
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:01,775
体验到了这场社交盛宴所带来的欢愉
before they return to the isolation of the desert.

522
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:22,255
沙漠是一幅画风粗犷  朴实无华的画卷
Deserts are landscapes of brutal simplicity.

523
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:26,255
它们付出甚少  却要求甚多
They provide so little and demand so much.

524
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:31,695
但只要勇气尚在
But, with courage,

525
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:35,855
坚韧不拔  才智过人
with endurance and intelligence...

526
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:40,095
虔诚奉献  匠心独运
..with devotion and ingenuity...

527
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:43,245
哪怕水资源极度匮乏
..desert people have found ways

528
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:46,695
沙漠中的人民也能唤起生命的奇迹
to conjure life from so little water.

529
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,725
尽管面对极大的困难  但这里的人们
Against the odds, they have

530
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:03,815
将对水的渴求  换化为对生的渴望
turned a life of thirst into a thirst for life.

531
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:14,685
人类星球

532
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:14,685
镜头背后的故事

533
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:27,325
唯有航拍  才能真正展示图布妇女
The only way to reveal the truly epic nature

534
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:31,405
横穿撒哈拉沙漠这一史诗般的行为
of the Tubu women's Sahara crossing was to film from the air.

535
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:39,765
希尼布勒这种小动力热气球
The best tool for this job was a Cinebulle-

536
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:43,005
即是最佳航拍工具
a hot-air balloon with a small motor.

537
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:47,565
但热气球不易操纵  驼群喜怒无常
But temperamental technology and cantankerous camels

538
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:50,755
这使得沙漠拍摄工作难以顺利开展
combined to make this the hardest desert shoot of all.

539
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:56,655
尼日尔  加索洛勒姆
北纬16°49'07"  东经11°17'00''

540
00:49:58,005 --> 00:49:59,885
历经三天的长途跋涉
It took three days of hard driving

541
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:02,155
摄影师托比・斯郎和他的团队
before cameraman Toby Strong and

542
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:05,165
终于追上图布妇女  开始录制工作
the crew could reach the women and start filming.

543
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,525
沙漠中行车  十分困难
Driving in the desert, it's so difficult.

544
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:13,045
这沙地凹凸不平
You've got all these ridges, troughs.

545
00:50:12,315 --> 00:50:16,495
托比・斯郎
摄影师

546
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:14,375
大家都这这样下坡的
The guys are going down stuff

547
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,525
车总是陷进沙里
like this and we're getting stuck all the time.

548
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:19,405
大家寸步难行  只能下车
That means everyone stopping, everyone out.

549
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:20,845
真挺让人失望的  但这是
It's frustrating, but it's the

550
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:23,045
自然疯狂的本性  人在沙漠身不由己
nature of the beast. We're here in the desert.

551
00:50:25,885 --> 00:50:29,195
他们终于到达了发射点  开始组装希尼布勒
They reach the launch site and start assembling the Cinebulle.

552
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:33,645
这是丹尼・克莱耶特・马里奥为摄制组量身打造的
Dany Cleyet-Marrel designed it specifically for filming.

553
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:38,585
在小引擎的带动下  希尼布勒极适合在
With only small engine, it flies best in the cool morning air

554
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,045
刮着微风的寒冷早晨航行
with no more than a light breeze.

555
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,885
这是我第一次乘坐希尼布勒
This is my first time up in a... in a Cinebulle.

556
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:53,285
我的两位摄影师朋友会和我一起
I've got two friends, two cameramen, who've been up in this.

557
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:56,325
据说  第一架希尼布勒撞树失事
The first one, they crashed into a tree,

558
00:50:56,535 --> 00:51:01,205
第二架  引擎起火
and on the second occasion, that caught fire, the actual engine.

559
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,485
我们等下会飞上天空
What I think we're gonna do is go up,

560
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:08,165
我没跟他们老实交代我的体重
and I might have lied a little bit about how heavy I am,

561
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,645
可能要多带一点燃料
so we might find out that he needs a little more gas.

562
00:51:10,645 --> 00:51:13,085
现在他们正在试飞
Kind of a bit of test flight, like that.

563
00:51:13,085 --> 00:51:15,115
但驼群完全不按套路出牌
But the camels haven't read the schedule

564
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:18,125
它们四散而去
and they've gone to the four corners.

565
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:22,535
每晚  牧人都要解开绳索  让驼群自由觅食
Every night, the camels are released to search for food.

566
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:27,285
清晨  又要颇费周折地将它们聚集起来
So, each morning, it takes time to round them up again.

567
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,525
我们得出发了  不然就太晚了
OK, we have to go, we have to go. It will be too late after.

568
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:35,085
驼群集中完毕
When the camels are finally ready,

569
00:51:35,085 --> 00:51:39,205
托比和丹尼升入空中  拍摄妇女装货
Toby and Dany set off to film the women loading up.

570
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:42,355
但拍摄并不顺利
But the shoot doesn't go well.

571
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:46,045
刚才气球起飞后
What happened was, the balloon took off,

572
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:45,935
特潘斯・斯通
《人类星球》制片人

573
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:48,365
经过一夜  丁烷气的温度很低
the butane gas has been cold overnight,

574
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:50,205
导致引擎熄火
and the burner was cutting out.

575
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:53,605
他们差点在妇女和驼群上方坠落
They almost came down within the women and the camels.

576
00:51:55,525 --> 00:51:59,925
气球坠落  撞向地面  又再次升起
And then the balloon came down, bounced, took off again,

577
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:02,125
驼群受惊了
completely freaking out the camels.

578
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,085
出师不利
So not a very good start to the morning.

579
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,805
引擎四次熄火
We lost the burner four times,

580
00:52:08,175 --> 00:52:12,885
气球冲着图布妇女儿童和驼群降下来
plummeted down over the camels, the Tubu women and the kids.

581
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:15,565
显然把她们吓坏了  其实我也有点害怕
Obviously, freaked them out. Freaked me out a little bit.

582
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,405
首战告败
So that wasn't great on the first flight.

583
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:22,675
经过几次尝试后  托比终于可以敏锐地捕捉风向
After a few more flights, Toby becomes acutely aware of the wind.

584
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:26,965
操纵希尼布勒  和开船的原理差不多
Working with Cinebulles is almost exactly like a boat.

585
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:28,405
你必须顺风行驶
You've got the wind going in that direction

586
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:30,425
虽然希尼布勒有引擎
and, although the Cinebulle's got a motor,

587
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:32,205
但也无法逆风而行
you can't really go against the wind.

588
00:52:32,205 --> 00:52:34,725
所以机会只有一次
So you've really only got one pop at each shot.

589
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:37,085
风向很难掌握
Difficult with the wind.

590
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:39,465
我们全力对抗大风
We're fighting the wind too much

591
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:41,735
引擎飞速工作  颤动十分明显
engine's revving and there's vibration and shake.

592
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,215
摇镜拍摄的角度非常小
I've only got a very limited arc to pan around.

593
00:52:45,565 --> 00:52:48,035
所以拍出好画面  很大程度上要仰仗
So there's a huge amount of skill involved from Dany

594
00:52:48,185 --> 00:52:48,865
丹尼和地面上的工作人员
and the guys on the ground

595
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:51,005
将驼群赶到正确的地方
getting the camels going the right way.

596
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:53,085
这是一个浩大的工程
So it's a massive logistical operation.

597
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,925
一开始  燃气给我们出难题
In the beginning we had a problem with the gas,

598
00:52:54,385 --> 00:52:59,205
丹尼・克莱耶特・马里奥
希尼布勒操纵员

599
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,885
接着  风向又给我们添麻烦
and after, a problem with the wind.

600
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:00,585
但明天一定会更好
But tomorrow will be better.

601
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:08,055
第二天早起飞行  大家又遇到了新麻烦
The next day, after an early flight, they face another problem.

602
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,775
图布妇女不会等待摄制组把希尼布勒装车
The Tubu women don't hang around for the crew

603
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:12,415
而长时间停留在此处
to pack up the Cinebulle.

604
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:16,575
她们储备的物资
They only have enough provisions

605
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:18,585
仅能维持正常穿越沙漠的旅程
for a normal trek across the desert,

606
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,885
所以  摄制组不得不采取"追拍"的策略
so the team has to play catch-up.

607
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,125
我现在真不知道驼群去了哪里
We've no idea where our camels have gone.

608
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,895
她们有25头骆驼
There's 25 camels out there.

609
00:53:24,975 --> 00:53:26,715
你觉得找到它们易如反掌  实则不然
You'd think we'd find them, but it's not...

610
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:27,765
你四下看看
you know, you look around and

611
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:30,485
一片荒芜的沙海
it is just like an ocean with a gentle swell.

612
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:32,675
我们漫无目的  驾车越过一座又一座沙丘
So we're just driving round peak to peak,

613
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:34,005
希望尽快看见她们
seeing if we can spot them.

614
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:39,685
好消息是  我们找到了驼队的"丝绸之路"
Good news, we've hit the main caravan route,

615
00:53:39,685 --> 00:53:42,205
有点点像沙漠中的M6公路
which is a bit like... bit like the M6,

616
00:53:42,205 --> 00:53:44,425
更棒的是
and even better news,

617
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,735
有几头骆驼就走在这路上
there's a few groups of camels coming this way.

618
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:48,955
那些比我眼力好的伙计说
The boys, with better eyes than I,

619
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:51,105
这就是我们要找的驼队了
say they think that this is some of our group,

620
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,545
这绝对是个好消息
so it's good news.

621
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:54,105
好的

622
00:53:59,405 --> 00:54:00,965
驼队准备到位
With the camels in place,

623
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:02,785
托比和丹尼终于等到了
Toby and Dany at last see the

624
00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:05,725
拍摄的绝佳机会
opportunity for getting some really good shots.

625
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,885
-还不错  -很好
- Not so bad. - It's nice.

626
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:17,995
我们拍的几组镜头还是不错的
I think we've got some nice shots.

627
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,765
最后  我们飞得很高
And then at the end, we went up really high,

628
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:23,785
整个沙漠尽在眼前  十分壮观
and to see the whole desert opened up was extraordinary.

629
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,175
真是次不错的经历
That was a good flight.

630
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:29,975
他们取得了一点成就  但前方还有更大的挑战
They've had some success, but the biggest challenge lies ahead

631
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:32,375
即  拍摄妇女抵达水井的场景
filming the women's arrival at the well.

632
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:34,725
但在这个沙尘四起的夜里
But on a dusty night,

633
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:36,495
节目的主角突然人间蒸发
the stars of the show go missing.

634
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:40,055
我们用探照灯做信号
We've just been using our big spotlight as a beacon,

635
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:42,995
因为今夜  有三个妇女和六头骆驼
because three of the women and six of the camels

636
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:44,465
没能赶到营地
couldn't make it into camp tonight

637
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:46,005
而在沙漠中
and here in the desert,

638
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,955
人员失踪的事时有发生
there's a very good chance of people getting lost.

639
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,055
庆幸的是  办法奏效了
Thankfully, it worked,

640
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,565
大家都安全回到营地过夜
so everyone is safely into camp for the night,

641
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:52,765
这真是个好消息
which is brilliant news.

642
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:56,725
只有当太阳落山后
It's only when the sun's gone down

643
00:54:56,725 --> 00:55:00,325
托比才有时间解决个人问题
that Toby has time to deal with a domestic problem.

644
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:03,325
我们从英国带了30个大箱子来
We brought out 30-odd cases from England.

645
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:06,405
但其中一个遗失了  里面全是我的衣服
One bag didn't turn up, and that bag was my clothes.

646
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:09,325
没时间等行李了  要赶紧进沙漠拍摄
So, couldn't wait for it, had to come into the desert,

647
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:13,445
所以我才老用限量的水
and that is why I'm washing my shirt quite regularly

648
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:16,485
洗我的衬衣
in, er...my allowance of water.

649
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:21,455
我当然不会浪费
None of this goes to waste.

650
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:24,365
明天要用这些水煮茶
This water will be used for... for tea tomorrow.

651
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:28,005
骗你的啦
No, it won't.

652
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:34,245
翌日清晨  成败在此一举
The next morning is the most important one.

653
00:55:34,245 --> 00:55:35,905
经过沙漠中的漫长征程
The women are due to arrive at the well

654
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:38,485
妇女们即将到达水井
after days of navigating across the desert.

655
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,705
托比能否捕捉到这一瞬间  至关重要
It's crucial that Toby gets shots of them arriving,

656
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,675
但和往常一样  拍摄过程困难重重
but, as usual, there are difficulties.

657
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:51,405
这一拍摄过程包括  发现水井
The logistics involved of finding where the well is

658
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:52,625
然后飞一大圈
and then driving the whole

659
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:54,645
以避免拍摄到轮胎的痕迹
way round so as not to get any tyre tracks.

660
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:57,205
丹尼要摸准风向
Dany having to guess where the wind's coming from.

661
00:55:57,205 --> 00:55:58,765
我们费尽周折辗转到此处
The whole logistical operation

662
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,365
都是为了捕捉这一瞬间
of getting right here, for this point, is enormous

663
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:04,005
我们一定会成功的
and we've just about managed to get it right.

664
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:06,365
大家各就各位  一切准备就绪
We're all here, we're ready to go.

665
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:09,165
风向十分理想  丹尼猜得正好
The wind is perfect. Dany got it spot-on.

666
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,855
45分钟后  驼队就会出现
And the camels are maybe 45 minutes away.

667
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:14,405
这还挺让人懊恼的
So, it's... it's massively frustrating.

668
00:56:14,745 --> 00:56:19,105
好极了  驼队还没出现
Now it's absolutely perfect. No camels.

669
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:24,225
和往常一样  骆驼在夜里自由觅食
Yet again, the camels have gone off foraging in the night,

670
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:29,975
而后随着太阳升起  它们出现在地平线上
then, at last, as the sun rises, they appear over the horizon.

671
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:36,885
天时地利人和
Everything comes together.

672
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:40,915
妇女和驼队已经到位  四下无风
The women and the camels are ready, and, with no wind,

673
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,525
托比披着晨曦  绕着驼队飞行
Toby is able to move around them in the early light,

674
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,605
抓拍这一副神奇的画面
capturing a magical scene.

675
00:57:25,285 --> 00:57:26,965
妇女们渐渐接近
As the women close in on the town

676
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:29,045
旅程的终点  法切镇
of Fachi at the end of the trek,

677
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,365
摄制组终于可以松一口气  将一切问题抛诸脑后
the crew can finally relax, with their problems behind them.

678
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:36,245
好极了  这次飞行十分精彩
Nice. It was a very, very nice flight.

679
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:39,565
光线不错  风速也恰到好处
Nice light. Good speed of wind.

680
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:41,565
我们好像有麻烦了  我以为我们着陆的地点
We've got a problem. I thought we landed far

681
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:43,685
远离城镇  这样就不会挡别人的路
enough away from town to be out of everyone's way.

682
00:57:43,805 --> 00:57:48,245
但你看地平线那的一群小黑点
But lurking to the horizon and there are hundreds of specks

683
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:50,525
向这边飞奔而来  我猜他们大概三分钟内
running this way. I reckon we've got three minutes

684
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:52,535
就会围过来
before we're completely engulfed.

685
00:57:53,455 --> 00:57:56,545
丹尼应该是去迎他们了
I think Dany's off to, er... intercept the hordes.

686
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,055
你好

687
00:57:58,445 --> 00:57:59,835
你给我们带礼物了吗

688
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:02,305
没有礼物

689
00:58:03,085 --> 00:58:05,565
这些小孩一定兴奋死了
Those kids must be so excited.

690
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,545
看来丹尼得好好"招待"他们一下了
I think Dany's got a bit of a treat for them.

691
00:58:07,835 --> 00:58:11,065
一  二  三...

692
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:22,265
最令人欣喜的是
To the delight of all,

693
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,065
摄制组不仅排除了艰难万险
the crew have triumphed against the odds...

694
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,075
还搞定了那些执拗的驼群
and the stubborn camels.
