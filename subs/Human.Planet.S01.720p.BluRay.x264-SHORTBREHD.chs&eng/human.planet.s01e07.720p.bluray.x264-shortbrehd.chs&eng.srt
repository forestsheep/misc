第七集

15
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,460
只有一种生物为了自己的生存
Only one creature has carved a life for itself

16
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,970
在地球的每一个角落都留下了印迹
in every habitat on Earth.

17
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,170
那就是人类
That creature is us.

18
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,940
天地悠悠
All over the world, 

19
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,800
我们仍依靠创造力来努力存活于世
we still use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

20
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,040
远离文明开化的城市
far from the city lights, 

21
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,930
直面原始险恶的自然
face to face with raw nature.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,520
人类总是被河流所吸引
Humans have always been drawn to rivers.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,190
河流流经地球上每个角落
Rivers flow through every environment,

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,580
带给我们生命之源
bringing us the essentials of life-

25
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,980
淡水
fresh water,

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,620
食物
food,

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,340
以及便利的交通
and ready-made highways.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
然而  水可载舟
But what rivers give, 

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,660
亦可覆舟
they can also take away.

30
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,200
可以形成洪水
They can flood,

31
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,570
冰冻
freeze

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,950
甚至干涸  消失殆尽
and sometimes disappear altogether.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,570
河流令我们承载了巨大的风险
Rivers force us to take great risks.

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,240
接下来将为您呈现非同一般的
These are remarkable stories of survival

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,690
在意想不到之处求生的精彩片段
from the most unpredictable habitat of them all.

36
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,320
河流

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,320
亦敌亦友

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,920
现在正值季风时节  
It's the monsoon season, 

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,490
东南亚最大的河流  湄公河蓄水充足
and the mighty Mekong, southeast Asia's greatest river, is in full flood.

40
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,150
位于柬埔寨和老挝之间的湄公河
Between Cambodia and Laos,

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,520
此时湍流之宽  乃是世界之最
the Mekong current creates the widest rapids in the world.

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,350
孔恩瀑布是捕鱼的最佳去处
The Khone Falls are great for fishing, 

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,360
但也十分危险
but also very dangerous,

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,080
当地渔民山酿对此再清楚不过了
as Sam Niang, a local fisherman, knows all too well.

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,700
渔网非常危险

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,910
如果我撒的不对  就会丧命

47
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,680
恐怕河水会把我卷走

48
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,550
那时谁也没有办法救我

49
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,190
迁徙的鱼群被困在这里
Migrating fish get trapped here, 

50
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,280
等待时机穿越激流
waiting to get up the rapids.

51
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,800
山酿不得不冒着生命危险捕获这些鱼
Sam Niang has to risk his life to catch them.

52
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,410
他有一家七口需要养活
He has a family of seven to feed.

53
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,130
他从家附近的河岸上开始
He starts by fishing from the riverside, near his home.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,540
季风时节
During the monsoon, 

55
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,370
湄公河的水量暴增至平时的二十倍
the Mekong swells to 20 times its normal volume,

56
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,060
这带来更多的鱼群
which brings more fish, 

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,270
但也给捕鱼增加了很大的难度
but makes them much harder to catch.

58
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,100
雨过之后  我担心会从岩石上滑下

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,490
石头上覆盖着黏液

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,480
走的时候必须十分小心

61
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,580
一个早晨过去了  他的渔网依然空空如也
After a morning, his net is still empty.

62
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,010
还有另外一个选择
There is another option- 

63
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,690
那就是在湍流中最为猛烈之处的一个孤岛
an island out in the main rapids.

64
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,360
要想到达那里  山酿就得冒上生命危险
But to get there, Sam Niang must take his life into his hands.

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,440
在旱季  他用旧电缆和少许绳索
In the dry season, he built a high wire across the rapids

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,810
造了一架穿越激流的绳索桥
out of old cable and bits of rope.

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,830
踩在绳索上时必须万分小心

68
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,470
如果滑倒  我必死无疑

69
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,780
而我不想扔下我的孩子们

70
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,400
一年中的这个时段
At this time of the year,

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,580
这里激流的流量约是尼亚加拉瀑布的两倍
these rapids have nearly twice the flow of Niagara Falls-

72
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,740
每秒逾一千一百万升
more than 11 million litres a second.

73
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,700
他终于到达了他所中意的捕鱼地点
He makes it to his favourite fishing perch.

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,120
汹涌的湍流将鱼赶入网中
Turbulent currents corral the fish,

75
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,340
山酿很快为家人捕获到了晚餐
and Sam Niang soon lands his family's supper.

76
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,980
尽管这里鱼量充足
Though the fish are plentiful here,

77
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,430
但他每次只能带几公斤回家
the most he can carry back is a few kilos at a time.

78
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,960
负重过大会让他在绳索上失去平衡
Any more, and he might lose his balance.

79
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,860
今天  山酿战胜了湄公河
Today, Sam Niang won his battle with the Mekong.

80
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,190
而明天  为了养活他的家人
Tomorrow, to keep his family fed, 

81
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,950
他还要继续战斗
he'll have to fight it again.

82
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,830
河流之所以危险  不仅仅在于水的力量
It's not just the power of water that makes rivers dangerous.

83
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,130
也在于其神秘莫测的本性
It's their erratic nature too.

84
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,560
准确解读河流的情况
Reading a river correctly

85
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,600
意味着生死一线的转机
can mean the difference between life and death.

86
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,690
詹斯卡尔峡谷是西藏边缘的一个神秘世界
The Zanskar valley is a hidden world on the edge of Tibet,

87
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,840
就在喜马拉雅山的中心地带
in the heart of the Himalayas.

88
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,820
冬天  这里被冰雪覆盖
In winter, it's cut off by snow.

89
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,810
进出之路尽被阻隔
All roads in and out are impassable.

90
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,600
斯坦金要送他的两个孩子去学校
Stanzin needs to get his two children to school,

91
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,650
但最近的学校也在一百公里之外
but the nearest school is 100 kilometres away,

92
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,130
唯一的路径
and the only way to get there

93
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,760
便是一条冰冻之河
is to walk down a frozen river.

94
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,910
需要六天的艰苦跋涉  这条路因极其危险
It's a six-day trek, so dangerous it's got its own name-

95
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,300
而获名"大披巾"  冰雪之毯之意
the Chadar- the blanket of ice.

96
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,970
要通过此路  必须经过严寒
They'll have to brave sub-zero temperatures,

97
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,040
雪崩和刺骨冰水的考验
avalanches and freezing water.

98
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,940
这学期在一周后开始
Term starts in a week.

99
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,980
上学的时间到了
It's time for the school run,

100
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,380
对十一岁的多卡来说  这是一次艰难的旅途
a formidable trip for 11-year-old Dolkar.

101
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,500
多卡  天空晴朗  正是出发的好时候

102
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,140
多卡十四岁的哥哥丘星也会同去
Dolkar's 14-year-old brother, Chosing, is coming too.

103
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,210
家人提前就为这次旅行做好了准备
The family prepare for the journey ahead.

104
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,890
多卡  东西都准备好了吗

105
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,210
好了

106
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,790
母亲为他们织了
Their mother has knitted

107
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,080
厚厚的羊毛袜来御寒
them thick woollen socks to protect them.

108
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,570
袜子合脚吗

109
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,680
千万要小心  多卡

110
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,080
别怕"大披巾"

111
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,320
你会害怕吗

112
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,460
不  和你在一起就不怕

113
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,040
这对兄妹相信他们父亲的
The brother and sister depend on 

114
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,450
勇气和生存技能
their father's courage and skill.

115
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,980
好好学习

116
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,070
好好照顾自己  宝贝

117
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,600
这一定是全世界最危险的求学之路
This has to be the most perilous school run in the world.

118
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,570
好好照顾自己  别着凉

119
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,270
多卡  丘星  保重

120
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,370
春天的融化似乎来得过早些
The spring melt seems to have started early, 

121
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,060
这令斯坦金甚为担心
which worries Stanzin.

122
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,890
这路会很难走

123
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,230
但我们必须去学校

124
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,950
除了"大披巾"  我们别无选择

125
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,340
我要带着孩子们去上学

126
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,620
来吧  别怕

127
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,370
斯坦金要确保冰能承受他们的重量
Stanzin has to make sure the ice can take their weight.

128
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,390
我在检查冰层的时候  感觉手的震动

129
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,210
就能分辨出冰层是否能承载我们的重量

130
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,170
他的这个技能马上就被验证了
And his expertise is tested immediately.

131
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,250
跟着我

132
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,380
一直跟着我

133
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,290
危险并不只在脚下
The danger is not only underfoot.

134
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,190
另一威胁是雪崩
There's another threat- avalanches.

135
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,360
怎么会有雪崩呢

136
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,320
雪太多了

137
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,620
我们得走另一条路

138
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,730
七天前  有人就死于詹斯卡尔河的雪崩
Seven days ago, an avalanche killed a man on the Zanskar river.

139
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,600
强烈的春日阳光带来另一个问题
The unusual spring sunshine has brought another problem.

140
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,730
流动的河水使得冰层开始融化
The river's current has already melted the ice.

141
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,800
斯坦金必须想办法通过眼前的障碍
Stanzin has to find a way past the barrier.

142
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,220
要么走这边  要么走那边  你们在这里等

143
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,220
这附近唯一一条路是一段狭窄的岩壁
The only way around is a narrow ledge.

144
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,520
过来  我们能走过去

145
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,610
这岩壁仅二十厘米宽  并被冰雪覆盖
The ledge is barely 20 centimetres wide and covered with snow.

146
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,840
与下面冻结的河流相距十米
There's a ten-metre drop to the freezing river below.

147
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,950
岩壁的末端有一些金属桩用以攀爬
The ledge ends with some metal pegs to climb down.

148
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,620
丘星爬过去了
Chosing makes it.

149
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,280
现在轮到多卡了
Now it's Dolkar's turn.

150
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,180
过来  多卡

151
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,300
过来  慢点儿  慢点儿

152
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,230
把你的手给我

153
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,380
脚踩在那儿

154
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,650
另一只脚也放下来

155
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,640
顺着岩石爬

156
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,500
我很害怕

157
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,520
过来

158
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
我把脚踩在这儿吗

159
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,390
是  抓住铁桩

160
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,270
他们不能耽搁
They mustn't delay.

161
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,440
夜幕即将降临
Night is falling fast, 

162
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,920
温度会骤降至零下三十摄氏度
and the temperature will plummet to minus 30 Celsius.

163
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,480
幸运的是  斯坦金知道附近有个山洞
Luckily, Stanzin knows a cave nearby.

164
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,120
你的手套干了吗

165
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,190
没事儿吧

166
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,770
-没事  -把袜子穿上

167
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,170
把这个戴上  不然会冷

168
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,920
孩子们需要睡觉
The children need their sleep.

169
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,790
前面还有"大披巾"最为危险的路段要走
The most dangerous part of the Chadar is still ahead.

170
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,410
一路上并不总是艰难险境
It's not all hard slog.

171
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,570
但是多卡的兴奋劲儿并没有持续多久
But Dolkar's fun can't last.

172
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,280
她的年龄最小  也是最先感到寒冷难耐的
As the smallest, she's the first to feel the cold.

173
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,300
她开始跟不上步伐了
She starts to lag behind.

174
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,470
在地球最高的山脉之中
One little girl on a melting ice river,

175
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,710
一个小女孩蹒跚于正在融化的冰河之上
among the greatest mountains on Earth.

176
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,030
终于到了最后一程
Now for the final leg.

177
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,110
如果掉进河里  你只能活八分钟

178
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,760
别走在我前面  你可能会掉下去

179
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,140
好的

180
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,920
冰川融化得只剩薄薄一层了
The melting ice has left just a tiny shelf.

181
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,770
在这里等

182
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,210
我先过去看看

183
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,340
冰层非常薄
It's thin. 

184
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,180
斯坦金担心它承受不了他们的重量
Stanzin is worried it won't take their weight.

185
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,260
随着他匍匐前进  冰层开始劈啪作响
As he advances, the ice starts to crack.

186
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,450
我害怕

187
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,610
斯坦金的重量使得冰块又脆弱了几分
With the ice weakened by Stanzin's weight,

188
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,090
孩子们必须鼓起勇气独立面对
the children have to brave it on their own.

189
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,970
-多卡先来  -好

190
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,030
慢点儿  爬过来

191
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,450
靠里些

192
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,960
慢一点

193
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
这里很薄  可能会裂开

194
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,520
小心点

195
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,320
多卡成功了  现在轮到丘星
Dolkar's made it, now for Chosing.

196
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,240
这里很薄  要小心

197
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,370
父亲的生存技能
Thanks to their dad's expertise,

198
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,970
保证了孩子们平安穿越"大披巾"
the children have survived the Chadar.

199
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,540
在冰河上挺过了六天
Six days out on the ice river.

200
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,620
喜马拉雅山的列城
The Himalayan town of Leh, 

201
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
是孩子们旅途的终点
journey's end for the children.

202
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,230
他们直奔学校
They rush straight to the school.

203
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,780
正好还有充分的时间告别
There's just enough time for a goodbye.

204
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,720
好好学习

205
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,690
爸爸  保重

206
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,150
我会给你打电话

207
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,230
给你寄钱过来

208
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,070
好好学习  知道吗

209
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,490
斯坦金现在要独自一人踏上归途
Stanzin now faces the return journey on his own.

210
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,950
消融中的冰河不仅仅
Melting river ice doesn't just

211
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,780
令长途跋涉变得更加艰难
make travelling harder.

212
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,090
当结冰的河面开始融化时
When frozen rivers break up, 

213
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,360
数以吨计的冰块四处漂浮
tonnes of ice start to flow,

214
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,400
成为巨大隐患
a potential disaster, 

215
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
即便是现代城市中心都受到威胁
even in the heart of a modern city.

216
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,700
在加拿大首都渥太华
In the Canadian capital, Ottawa,

217
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,140
春季冰河的融解
spring melt turns the Rideau river 

218
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,130
使丽都河成为全民头号公敌
into public enemy number one.

219
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,220
最危险的地方在于
The danger point is

220
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,370
冰冻的瀑布之上还有一架人行天桥
a footbridge on a frozen waterfall,

221
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,210
而这瀑布正是丽都河
a bottleneck where the Rideau

222
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,940
汇入渥太华河的瓶颈河段
flows into the Ottawa river.

223
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,450
现在是二月末
It's late February, 

224
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,670
这里的冰层正在融化
and the ice is melting here too.

225
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,010
巨大的冰块会形成一座危险的大坝
Ice blocks are in danger of forming a dam,

226
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,520
可能会引发破坏极大的洪涝灾害
which might lead to devastating flooding.

227
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,420
这样的自然威胁需要人们果敢地介入干预
A natural threat that needs a daring human solution.

228
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,730
有请"冰坝终结者"
Meet the ice-dam busters!

229
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,300
他们不仅要预测大自然的举动
Their job isn't just to predict nature,

230
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,780
还必须战胜大自然
they have to beat it!

231
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,070
天桥后有数以千吨的
There are thousands of tonnes of ice behind the bridge, 

232
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,680
厚达一米的冰层
up to a metre thick.

233
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
这支队伍要破坏冰层
The team needs to break it up

234
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,860
以保证河水的正常流动
to keep the river flowing.

235
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,350
第一步
Stage one- 

236
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,250
将冰层切割成长条状
cut the ice into long strips.

237
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,120
但体积还是太大  无法穿过天桥
They're still too large to flow under the bridge, 

238
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,090
所以  进行第二步
so, for stage two,

239
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,340
采用了更为可靠的做法
the team uses a more persuasive force...

240
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,450
准备
Now!

241
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,310
安放数百公斤的炸药
...hundreds of kilos of dynamite.

242
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,890
开始
Hup!

243
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,170
现在  小块的冰可以顺利通过天桥
Bite-size pieces now flow easily under the bridge 

244
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,900
越过瀑布了
and over the falls.

245
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,190
渥太华市中心又能平安度过一年
The centre of Ottawa is safe for another year.

246
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,640
世界上最大的河流
The world's largest rivers

247
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,250
给我们的生活带来最大的危险
bring the most danger to our lives.

248
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
它们的洪流可是致命的
Their floods can be devastating.

249
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,240
泛滥之初总是毫无征兆
They often happen without warning,

250
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,220
而我们除了仓皇出逃别无它法
and there's nothing we can do but try to escape.

251
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,020
在孟加拉  数千万的人口
In Bangladesh, tens of millions of people

252
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,600
不得不在恒河及其支流冲击河岸时
can be displaced when the Ganges and her tributaries 

253
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,310
举家迁移
burst their banks.

254
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,600
河流的力量非常强大
The river is so strong, 

255
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,730
它经常会改变河道方向
it regularly changes course,

256
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,400
同时冲刷着沿岸的陆地
brushing land aside as it goes.

257
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,280
一个月前穆罕默德・贾里尔的村庄
A month ago, Mohamed Jaleel's village 

258
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,670
离河岸还有一百多米远
was 100 metres from the bank.

259
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,710
今天他的房子就面临着被冲走的危险
Today, his house is about to be swept away.

260
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,550
他和邻居们
He and his neighbours have

261
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,270
只有几分钟的时间搬家
only minutes to move his home.

262
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,020
而其余的居民只能在旁无助地看着
The rest of the villagers look on, helpless,

263
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,130
越涨越高的河水吞噬着他们的家园
as the rising river obliterates their land.

264
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,070
在南美洲  洪水的力量强大到
In South America, floods can be so huge

265
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,600
人们不得不用全年的时间
that the entire year has to

266
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,540
作出防洪计划
be spent planning for them.

267
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,610
在亚马逊盆地
In the Amazon basin,

268
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,760
一位母亲为上涨的河水做着万全的准备
one mother prepares for the rising waters.

269
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,530
贾妮娅生活在巴西的尼格罗河
Jarnia lives by the Rio Negro in Brazil.

270
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,200
现在是十一月份  正值旱季
It's November, the dry season, 

271
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,010
是食物最丰盛的季节
the time of plenty.

272
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,870
不仅能够轻松捕到鱼
Fish are so easy to catch,

273
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,480
她甚至还有多余的食物喂食当地的江豚
she even has enough to feed the local river dolphins.

274
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,570
来吧

275
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,340
过来吃鱼

276
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,090
但是六个月后涨潮之时
But in six months' time, when the flood water invades,

277
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,940
这些江豚  还有小鱼
all these dolphins and the fish with them

278
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,720
都会藏匿在洪溢林中完成生育大计
will disappear into the flooded forest to breed.

279
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,790
如果没有了鱼
When the fish are gone,

280
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,080
养活这一大家子就是个梦魇了
feeding her large family will become a nightmare.

281
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,200
要熬过这段时间就必须未雨绸缪
Surviving such hard times means thinking ahead,

282
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
贾妮娅为此制定了四步计划
and Jarnia has a four-stage plan.

283
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,860
第一步  提前六个月
Stage one is collecting turtle eggs 

284
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,400
在涨潮之前采集乌龟蛋
six months before the floods arrive.

285
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,630
这里有痕迹

286
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,350
我找到了两个巢

287
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,810
旱季时河龟会在滩涂上
River turtles lay thousands of eggs

288
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,250
产下数千枚蛋
in the dry season beaches,

289
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,290
以待孵育
which they leave to hatch.

290
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,480
河水上涨时
Turtles are a reliable source of protein

291
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,320
乌龟是最稳定的蛋白质来源
when the waters rise,

292
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,720
所以这些蛋就很珍贵了
so these eggs are precious.

293
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,550
回到村庄  开始第二步
Back in the village, it's time for stage two.

294
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,360
贾妮娅把蛋重新埋在自己的小龟苗圃里
Jarnia reburies the eggs in her turtle nursery.

295
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,570
在野外  很多龟蛋会被动物吃掉
In the wild, many eggs would be eaten by animals,

296
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,750
但在这里  它们是安全的
but here they'll be safe.

297
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,830
四个月后  到了三月
By March, four months later, 

298
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,920
三千多只小龟破壳而出
3,000 eggs have hatched.

299
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,260
于是开始第三步
It's stage three- 

300
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,360
放生
release day!

301
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,550
我们很喜欢这些小龟

302
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,980
把它们放回河里

303
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,690
我们真的很开心

304
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,880
一旦有小龟不幸死了  我们会很难过

305
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
是时候将小宝贝们送走了
It's time to release the babies.

306
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,660
不过会有足够的乌龟活下来
But will enough of them survive

307
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,120
在涨潮之际为全村提供食物吗
to feed the village in the floods to come?

308
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,110
现在是六月  大雨滂沱
It's June, the height of the rains.

309
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,030
水位上升了七米
The river rises seven metres.

310
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,220
贾妮娅的村落完全变了样
Jarnia's village is transformed.

311
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,560
树林被水淹没
The forest is flooded,

312
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,710
最近的陆地
and the nearest dry land

313
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,670
也要六个多小时的水路才能到达
is more than six hours' rowing away.

314
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,530
贾妮娅一家现在正被地球上
Jarnia's family is now marooned

315
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,000
规模最大的季节性洪水困得动弹不得
by the greatest annual flood on the planet.

316
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,150
到最后一步计划了
Time for the final stage.

317
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,410
贾妮娅和她的妹妹多拉准备出门猎龟
Jarnia and her sister Dora prepare to go turtle-hunting.

318
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,810
贾妮娅的丈夫弗朗西斯科
Jarnia's husband, Francisco, 

319
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,710
为她们做了一支猎龟的长矛
makes them a turtle-hunting spear,

320
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,570
姐妹俩出发觅食去了
and then the two sisters set off in search of food.

321
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,640
她们之前的辛勤劳作
Will their hard work

322
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,140
能换回餐桌上的累累硕果吗
bring dinner to the table?

323
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,040
起初  形势并不乐观
At first, it's not looking promising.

324
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,350
它们不上钩

325
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,370
是啊  根本不上钩

326
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,780
今天很难能捕到龟了

327
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,570
但是贾妮娅发现了一只
Then Jarnia spots one.

328
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,200
抓到一只

329
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,250
今天能吃顿好饭了

330
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,330
她的准备工作获得了回报
Her preparation's paid off.

331
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,660
家里人不会饿肚子了
She'll be able to feed everyone.

332
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,220
贾妮娅的远见卓识
Jarnia's foresight has pulled

333
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,190
令她的家人度过了这段艰难的洪水时期
her family through another difficult flood.

334
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,350
河流中的一些生物对人类有着直接的威胁
Some river creatures pose a direct threat to humans.

335
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,960
位于非洲的赞比西河
The Zambezi river in Africa

336
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,260
生活着如大象  鳄鱼和河马这样
is used by elephants, crocodiles and hippos,

337
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,150
陆地上最为危险的动物
some of the continent's most dangerous animals.

338
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,300
渔民约瑟法特和他的兄弟们找到一个
Fisherman Josphat and his brothers have found a safe,

339
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,220
有些骇人但还算安全的捕鱼地点
if slightly hair-raising, fishing spot,

340
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,590
在这里不但可以捕获食物
a place where they can catch lunch

341
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,200
而且不会有生命危险
without becoming dinner themselves.

342
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,730
我们步行前往这条河

343
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,990
要走六英里

344
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,350
这里水流湍急  所以不会有鳄鱼出没

345
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,260
鳄鱼和河马害怕急流

346
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,080
他们要去的地方也许可以避开鳄鱼
The place they're heading for may be safe from crocodiles,

347
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,170
但危险依然存在
but it does have a drawback.

348
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,210
我们从来不单独行动

349
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,220
总是结伴而行

350
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,790
捕鱼时即便出现状况

351
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,500
我们也不分开

352
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,490
约瑟法特的捕鱼地点之所以危险
The reason Josphat's fishing pools are far from safe

353
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,920
是因为他们所处的位置
is their precarious position,

354
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,240
正是维多利亚瀑布的最顶端
at the very top of Victoria Falls.

355
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,550
我们从不害怕

356
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,510
祖辈教过我们该去何方

357
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,060
约瑟法特的勇敢与技巧
Josphat's bravery and skill

358
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,040
让他能够到其他动物无法涉足的地方捕鱼
enable him to fish where no animal dares to venture.

359
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,320
人们能够克服洪水
People can overcome floods

360
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,080
甚至学会在巨大瀑布的边缘捕鱼
and even learn to fish on giant waterfalls,

361
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,160
但在河流的另外一面
but there's one face of a river 

362
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,180
才真正令人难以生存
that's virtually impossible to survive.

363
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,960
当河流干涸并消失
When a river dries up and disappears, 

364
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,320
所有生命亦随之逝去
all life drains away.

365
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,600
利马盖是肯尼亚北部的一个桑布鲁骆驼牧人
Lemagas is a Samburu camel herder in northern Kenya.

366
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,080
八个月来这里没有下过一滴雨
No rain has fallen here for eight months.

367
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,560
今年旱情极其严重
It's a severe drought, 

368
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,250
米尔吉斯河早已消失
and the Milgis river has vanished.

369
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,060
利马盖不得不带领着他宝贵的骆驼群
Lemagas has been forced to range deep into the desert,

370
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,190
深入沙漠寻找食物
searching for fresh food for his precious camels.

371
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,100
现在他们远离家园
Now they are far away from home,

372
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,500
而且饮用水早已耗尽
and they've run out of drinking water.

373
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,780
对我们桑布鲁人来说  水是最珍贵的东西

374
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,090
每当旱季来临时

375
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,540
我们都祈求自然之神赐予我们雨水

376
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,960
甚至连骆驼都无法忍受
Not even the camels can survive

377
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,630
如此长时间水分的匮乏
this long without a drink.

378
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,580
利马盖知道这里有水
Lemagas knows there is water here,

379
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,100
就藏在这河床之下
hidden underneath the river bed.

380
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,290
但是如何去寻找呢
But how can he find it?

381
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:11,020
桑布鲁人学会了依靠另一种游牧的动物
The Samburu have learned to rely on another nomadic creature,

382
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,770
它们总是在夜间出没
one that usually travels at night.

383
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,870
在利马盖和他的骆驼休息之时
While Lemagas and his camels rest,

384
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,880
不远处  一些体型庞大的水源占卜师
not far away, some giant water-diviners 

385
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,370
在河床上嗅来嗅去
are sniffing out the river bed.

386
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,140
大象鼻子的灵敏度
An elephant's trunk- its nose-

387
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,010
远远超过人类
is far more sensitive than a human's,

388
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,870
这意味着它们可以找到
which means it can tell

389
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,880
何处的水源离地表更近
where the water table is closest to the surface.

390
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,290
一头大象每天要喝掉一百升的水
Elephants must drink 100 litres a day

391
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,630
它的鼻子每次能吸入八升水
and can suck up eight litres of water at a time.

392
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,880
喝足以后  象群在黎明到来之前就离开了
Having drunk, the elephants leave before dawn.

393
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,690
第二天一早
Early next morning,

394
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,280
利马盖和他的骆驼们尾随象群的足迹
Lemagas and his camels are on the elephants'trail.

395
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,370
大象帮了我们大忙

396
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,630
寻找水源的路上  它们会留下粪便

397
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,240
我们随着粪便一路走下去

398
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,110
就能找到水源

399
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,740
它们走到哪里  哪里就有水

400
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,630
大象们真棒

401
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,500
带我们找到了这个水洼

402
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,920
如果你懂得如何寻找的话
Even a dry river bed holds water

403
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,550
即便是干涸的河床依然饱含水分
if you know where to look.

404
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,830
他们唱起颂歌感谢上帝  还有大象们
They sing their thanks to the gods, and the elephants.

405
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,570
几天以后
A few days later, 

406
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,800
利马盖终于回到他的村庄
Lemagas finally returns to his village

407
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,890
带着他的永恒之井
with its permanent deep well.

408
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,900
他始终记得在荒野中得到的帮助
He doesn't forget the help he's been given in the wild.

409
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,880
归来后的头等大事就是取出弥足珍贵的水
The first thing he does is to bring up precious water,

410
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,890
不单单为了他的族人和家人
not just for his herd and his family,

411
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,430
当然还有他的动物朋友们
but for his wild friends too.

412
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,790
我们把水放在外面

413
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,080
给路过的动物们喝

414
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,280
因为我们桑布鲁人

415
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,190
崇尚与万物共生存

416
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,840
他从未忘记夜行水源占卜师的恩情
He doesn't forget his nocturnal water-diviners, 

417
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,180
若没有它们
for without them,

418
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,400
利马盖和他的骆驼群在远离家园的地方
Lemagas and his camels could never survive

419
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,580
势必难以存活
when they're far away from home.

420
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:52,010
远在四千公里外的马里
Over 4,000 kilometres away, in Mali, another dry river,

421
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,090
尼日尔河的一条支流几近干涸
a tributary of the Niger,

422
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,680
一个人正面临艰难的抉择
is forcing one man into making a difficult decision.

423
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,740
他叫乌瑟曼
His name is Ouseman, 

424
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,330
他是杰内古城的泥瓦匠专家
and he's a master mason in Djenne,

425
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,010
这座古城所有建筑均由河泥建成
an ancient city made entirely of river mud.

426
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,130
他的工作就是维护城中的清真寺
His job is to maintain the city's mosque,

427
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,090
这是世界上最大最早的泥制建筑
the biggest and oldest mud building in the world.

428
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,970
清真寺是乌瑟曼族人最为重要的部分
It's the heart of Ouseman's culture.

429
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,930
伊斯兰教对我们来说至关重要

430
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,290
我们的清真寺举世无双

431
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,230
乌瑟曼的烦恼在于
Ouseman's problem is this- 

432
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,890
每年雨季到来之前
every year the mosque needs

433
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,080
必须给清真寺涂上一层新的河泥来保护它
a fresh coat of mud to protect it before the rains arrive.

434
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,690
在干涸的河床上
Down in the dry river bed, 

435
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,020
人们将泥与米糠混合
the mud is blended with rice husks,

436
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,970
然后令其发酵
and then left to ferment.

437
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,690
但是今年的发酵物没有达到适当的粘稠度
But this year, the mix hasn't reached the right consistency,

438
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,720
而大雨将至
and now the rains are almost upon him.

439
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,920
沙尘暴正在肆虐
Dust storms are blowing in,

440
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,560
这是雨季开始的前兆
the first signs that the wet season is about to begin.

441
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,280
这座神圣的寺庙急缺一件新的"雨衣"
The sacred building desperately needs a new storm-proof skin.

442
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,660
两天后
Two days later,

443
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,160
乌瑟曼和他的朋友易卜拉欣又来到河边
Ouseman and his friend Ibrahim return to the river.

444
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,760
可以给寺庙涂上新泥了吗

445
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,990
今天看来可以了

446
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,970
这是个重大决定
It's a big decision.

447
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,050
消息不胫而走  全城集体出动
Word spreads fast, and everyone comes down to help.

448
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,350
杰内古城的人民
Everyone in Djenne has been waiting 

449
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,530
每天都盼着这个特殊的日子
all year for this special day.

450
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,910
嵌于其中的棕榈木板成为泥瓦匠的踏板
The built-in palm logs are perches for the plasterers.

451
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,850
人们倾巢而出  为保卫清真寺贡献一份力量
The whole town mucks in to protect the mosque for another year.

452
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,960
人们如此积极只为一个理由

453
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,170
愿自己的祷告能够得到神的回应

454
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,040
杰内古城的清真寺已有七百年的历史
There's been a mud mosque in Djenne for 700 years,

455
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,870
这个神圣的一城中心因河泥而兴旺着
the sacred heart of a city fashioned from river mud.

456
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,930
我们与河流的关系纷纭复杂
Our relationship with rivers is never easy.

457
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,120
所谓水可载舟
Their waters can give us so much

458
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,710
亦可覆舟
but can also take everything away.

459
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,890
我们总是被河流狂放
We will always be at the mercy of their wild 

460
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,690
而且捉摸不定的姿态所支配
and unpredictable nature.

461
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,490
但有一个民族已经学会
But one culture has found an inspiring way

462
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,170
与暴虐的河流和平共处
of mastering their savage rivers.

463
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,620
在印度东北部
In northeast India, 

464
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,540
一个神秘世界隐藏在悬崖峭壁之间
a giant cliff leads up into a hidden world,

465
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,880
那就是梅加拉亚邦
Meghalaya.

466
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,010
位于海拔两千米的山峦之中
Nearly two kilometres high 

467
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,040
季风性积雨云萦绕其间
and buffeted by monsoon storm clouds,

468
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,260
这里很可能是世界上最为潮湿的地方
this is possibly the wettest place on Earth.

469
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,310
降雨量在一年之内一度达到二十五米
Once, 25 metres of rain fell here in a year, 

470
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,100
创造了世界纪录
the world record.

471
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,770
在这里生活面临着巨大的考验
Living here poses an unusual problem,

472
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,100
这不仅仅是避雨的问题
and it's not just keeping dry.

473
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,020
几乎所有降水都发生在夏季季风时节
Nearly all the rain falls during the summer monsoon.

474
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,550
涓涓细流摇身一变  成为滔滔山洪
Rivers switch from gentle streams to raging torrents.

475
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,420
河水肆虐且难以捉摸
They become wild and unpredictable 

476
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,090
几乎无法渡过
and almost impossible to cross.

477
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,450
哈利和他的侄女朱莉安娜
Harley and his niece Juliana

478
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,260
正忙着进行一项巧妙的解决方案
are busy cultivating a cunning solution.

479
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,030
看这儿  看这儿

480
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,950
我教你怎么做

481
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,300
三十年前  哈利在这片河岸
30 years ago, Harley planted this strangler fig

482
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,630
种下了这棵勒颈无花果树
on the river's edge, 

483
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,860
今天  他教朱莉安娜如何养护
and today, he's teaching Juliana how to care for it.

484
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,020
盘根错节的无花果树根
The fig's tangled roots

485
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,930
保护着河岸的土不被冲走
help to prevent the bank being washed away.

486
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:04,520
你要小心照看这些树根

487
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,200
确保它们不被破坏

488
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,470
他教朱莉安娜慢慢地将树根穿过
He teaches Juliana to coax the roots across 

489
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,380
现在还只是条小溪的河
what is now just a stream.

490
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,360
当树根到达另一端  他们将其固定好
When they reach the other side, they'll take hold there.

491
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,490
这是抵御洪水的基本结构
This is the basis of a structure that will survive any deluge.

492
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,530
一座生命之桥
A living bridge.

493
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,490
这项工程浩大
It's an epic project that 

494
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,400
没人能单靠自己的一生就完成
no man can complete in one lifetime,

495
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,270
所以哈利向朱莉安娜传授知识
so Harley is passing on his knowledge to Juliana.

496
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,550
注意这里  我会告诉你怎么做

497
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,780
这么做对吗

498
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,860
朱莉安娜每年都得来打理这些树根
Each year,Juliana will need to tend the roots, 

499
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,450
让它们更加粗壮
making them stronger.

500
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,070
如果她在有生之年完成了她的桥
If she stays and completes her bridge,

501
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,720
这里将成为村民们往来通道的一部分
it will become part of the commuter route here,

502
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,290
由许多生命之桥构成的交通网络
a network of dozens of living bridges 

503
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,690
连通着梅加拉亚邦的山谷
that connect the valleys of Meghalaya.

504
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,550
有些这样的桥已经有几百年的历史了
Some of them are many centuries old.

505
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,490
甚至还有些是双层的
There are even double-deckers.

506
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,900
这座桥可以一直生长五百年

507
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,670
你的孩子们会用上它

508
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,240
以及你孩子的孩子

509
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,620
有了朱莉安娜的照料
With Juliana to look after it,

510
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,720
这座桥的未来令人充满希望
the future of this young bridge looks secure,

511
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,390
它会成为扎实稳固  生命力十足的建筑
sustainable, living architecture

512
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,730
并伴随着人们一代又一代的成长
that will live and grow for generations,

513
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,110
这是全世界甚为罕见的景象
one of the very few examples in the world

514
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,940
人类发明了这种奏效且天然的解决方案
where humans have come up with a successful and natural solution,

515
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,980
通过与大自然的协作
a way of working with nature

516
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,980
来克服自然河流造成的难题
to overcome the problems a wild river can cause.

517
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,050
人类星球
镜头背后的故事

518
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,430
人类星球河流摄制组的工作人员
For the Human Planet Rivers team, 

519
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,280
在汹涌澎湃的湄公河上进行拍摄
filming on the Mekong river at the height of the monsoon

520
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,150
遇到了许多挑战
raised many challenges.

521
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,010
重要的是  如何捕捉到
Mainly, how do you capture

522
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,970
一个精彩绝伦的镜头  而不让你的摄像机
a remarkable event without losing your camera,

523
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,980
小组成员或者你追拍的渔夫
your crew or your star fisherman,

524
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,460
山酿  掉入河中呢
 Sam Niang, to the river?

525
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,900
孔恩瀑布是世界上
The Khone Falls have more water flowing over them

526
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:34,630
老挝  孔恩瀑布
北纬13°56'53''  东经105°56'26''

527
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,220
流量最大的瀑布
than any other waterfall in the world.

528
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,550
宽广的湄公河的一条狭道
A narrowing of the mighty Mekong river 

529
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,790
困住了迁徙的鱼群
funnels the migrating fish

530
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,380
同时也提供了一个危险却有利可图的机会
and provides a dangerous, if lucrative, opportunity.

531
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,680
第一天

532
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,120
摄制组来此探索
The crew's here to capture the extreme lengths

533
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,810
当地人捕鱼的极限
that locals will go to catch fish.

534
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,720
山酿成为拍摄对象
Sam Niang is lucky. 

535
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,190
他有办法到达他的小岛去捕鱼
He has access to his own small island for fishing.

536
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,510
但是要想到达目的地
But to get to his prime spot, 

537
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,670
他必须冒生命危险
he must risk life and limb.

538
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:26,530
到了六月  开始进入雨季  我会很开心

539
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,400
在雨季里  人们不可能过河上岛

540
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,670
只有我可以用我的绳索走过去

541
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,660
那是我捕鱼的重要地点

542
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,880
如果有鱼

543
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,070
没有谁可以和我一起捕鱼

544
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,960
为了拍下山酿走高空绳索的奇观
To capture the spectacle of Sam Niang's high-wire feat,

545
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,730
第二天

546
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,510
摄制组采用了一个在电缆上滑动
the crew have chosen a gadget that runs on wires

547
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,260
且通过电动控制摄像机的小装备
and that controls the camera electronically,

548
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,510
它被称为移动摄影车
known as a cable dolly.

549
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,470
这是其中最令人激动且广受欢迎的点子
And the idea is, it's one of our most exciting and sought-after shots,

550
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,730
蕾妮・戈弗雷
人类星球研究员

551
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,720
这样我们就可以跟拍在绳索上行走的人了
so we can follow someone walking across the tightrope,

552
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,900
摄像机可以跟着他们移动
so the camera moves with them

553
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,480
并且将咆哮的激流展现在大家眼前
and then pulls out to reveal the angry water.

554
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,700
但是  要在一条如此狂怒的激流上
But rigging such a hi-tech system 

555
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,680
安装这样的高端系统可不是件容易的活
over a raging torrent is no easy feat,

556
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,070
需要有专业的装配人员
and it requires a specialist rigger.

557
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,080
我们为摄影车装上电缆
We're just trying to get the cable across for the dolly,

558
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,990
蒂姆・福格
绳索技师

559
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,160
这位当地人只要
so the local guy's just

560
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,220
像他平常那样从绳索上走过去就行了
shimmied across the wires, as he does every day.

561
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,370
维尔斯特・蒂姆负责电缆  
Whilst Tim works on the cables, 

562
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,470
摄制组其他人
the rest of the team

563
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,110
则全神贯注于从各个角度拍摄急流
concentrate on filming the rapids from every other angle,

564
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,980
甚至不惜冒险置身其中
even shooting in the rapids themselves.

565
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,430
我刚刚到了那儿  不是很远
I'll just go here. It won't be a long run.

566
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,420
米克・奥谢
划艇运动员及安全顾问

567
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,450
这大概要花两到三分钟
It'll take two or three minutes.

568
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,130
米克・奥谢是第一个
Mick O'Shea was the first man ever to 

569
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,310
横渡湄公河西藏到中国南部河段的人
navigate the entire Mekong, from Tibet to southern China-

570
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,610
他为我们捕捉到了更为真实的镜头
just the man to capture a fish-eye view.

571
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,730
即便是他  也不得不屈服于
But even he succumbs to 

572
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,520
汹涌澎湃的湄公河
the full force of the Mekong in surge.

573
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,990
他的皮艇被猛烈的激流打入水中
His kayak is sucked under by the powerful current

574
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,630
顺流而下
and swept downstream.

575
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,870
经过几分钟的焦急等待
After a few worrying minutes, 

576
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,580
米克出现了  他重新掌控了划艇
Mick re-appears, back in control,

577
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,620
虽安然无恙却心有余悸
safe but shaken.

578
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,850
第三天

579
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,450
对湄公河的威慑力有了更深的认识后
With new-found respect for the Mekong's power,

580
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,200
摄制组回到了陆地进行拍摄
the crew stick to solid ground.

581
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,200
他们通过一个四米长的摇臂
Using a four-metre jib, 

582
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,300
跟拍山酿在一块
they follow Sam Niang as he negotiates 

583
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,490
极为危险的岩石上撒网捕鱼的场景
a treacherous rocky outcrop to cast his net.

584
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,710
第四天

585
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,460
下来点儿  继续  很好
Over and down, OK? And on... Good.

586
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:53,080
现在  蒂姆已经为移动摄影车搭好了电缆
By now, Tim has the rigging ready for the dolly.

587
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,800
你要这个东西吗
Do you want this up here?

588
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,900
有一团巨大的乌云飘过来了
There's a massive cloud come over.

589
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,820
但是还没来得及把机器遮好  就下雨了
But no sooner than it's in place, the heavens open.

590
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,070
这是他们最不想看到的事
It's the last thing they need.

591
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,350
拍摄因为技术和安全原因暂停了
Dolly filming stops for technical and safety reasons.

592
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,990
狂风暴雨之下

593
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,060
走在绳索上令我有些害怕

594
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,810
我怕掉进水里

595
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,710
如果掉进了水里  就必死无疑了

596
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:43,030
马克・福劳斯
人类星球制片人

597
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,090
现在雨下得不大
There's just a little spot of rain. 

598
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,550
我看就快停了
I think rain's stopping play!

599
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,430
我们的发电机罢工了

600
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:53,430
我们打算下载剪辑  以继续明天的拍摄

601
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,650
但是雨水可能会毁了电脑和相机

602
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,560
不知道接下来会怎样

603
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,930
-没关系  电子产品的防水性能很好  -没错
-Yeah...Cos electronics survive the rain well. - Yeah.

604
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,410
第二天早上  如担心的一样
The next morning, it's clear that, as feared,

605
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,970
雨水渗进了电子设备
water has got into the electronics.

606
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,550
第五天

607
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,720
那现在是什么问题呢
So what's gone wrong with it now?

608
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,930
最主要的是移动摄像机没有马达

609
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:27,810
这样就不能让它在电缆上来回移动

610
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,780
我们现在打算用一个平衡锤来拉它

611
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,930
这个方法已经用了很多年了

612
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,970
这么说现代化科技还是被老式方法取代了
So the new, modern technology is ousted by the old-school way.

613
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,740
完全正确

614
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,270
第六天

615
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,730
我现在爬上去
I'm going to go up there now 

616
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,680
把摄像机装上
and, um, put the camera on!

617
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,950
理查德・柯比
摄影师

618
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,940
我的天  好吧
Oh, my... Whoa! OK.

但山酿还是很开心 不是吗 
Sam Niang looks really happy, though, doesn't he?

633
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,500
每当他从绳索上走过去
My heart's in my mouth every time

634
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,540
我都会紧张万分
he has to go over that rope.

635
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,920
你很开心  我可是很担心
You look really happy, and I'm really worried!

What a relief.

642
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,020
