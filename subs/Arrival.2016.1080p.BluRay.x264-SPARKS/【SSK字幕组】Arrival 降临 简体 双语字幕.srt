1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,959
我曾经认为
I used to think

2
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,679
这是你的故事的开始
this was the beginning of your story.

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,795
回忆是一种奇怪的东西
Memory is a strange thing.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,272
因为它和我所想的不太一样
It doesn't work like I thought it did.

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,150
我们太局限于时间 因果顺序
We are so bound by time, by its order.

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,554
好
Okay.

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,317
好 来我这儿
Okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,118
让妈妈抱抱
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,071
让妈妈抱抱
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,713
把手举起来
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,396
你就是镇上的警长
Are you the sheriff in this here town?

12
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,711
这是我的挠痒枪 我会抓住你
These are my tickle guns, and I'm gonna getcha!

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,358
不
No!

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,035
你想让我追你 你最好得跑了
You want me to chase you? You better run!

15
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,514
-啊 -哦
- Ah! - Oh!

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,669
我还记得中间的一些片段
I remember moments in the middle.

17
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,717
我爱你
I love you.

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,953
我恨你
I hate you!

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,951
到这里就结束了
And this was the end.

20
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,514
嘘
Shhh...

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,789
到妈妈这里来
Come back to me.

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,632
回到妈妈这里
You come back to me.

23
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,479
可现在我不确定
But now I'm not so sure

24
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,755
我还能不能分得清起点和终点了
I believe in beginnings and endings.

25
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,918
有那么一段你生命之外的时间 勾勒出你的故事
There are days that define your story beyond your life.

26
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
就像它们降临的那天
Like the day they arrived.

27
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
早上好
Good morning.

28
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
早上好
Morning.

29
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,831
大家都去哪了
Where is everyone?

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,510
好吧 那咱们开始上课
Okay. Well, let's get started.

31
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,438
今天我们来讲葡萄牙语
Today we are talking about Portuguese

32
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,511
以及其为什么听起来和
and why it sounds so different

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,949
其他的罗马语系那么不同
from the other Romance languages.

34
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,352
葡萄牙语起源于加利西亚王国
The story of Portuguese begins in the kingdom of Galicia...

35
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,715
-抱歉 -在中世纪的时候
- Sorry. - ...in the Middle Ages,

36
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,349
语言被视作为对艺术的一种表达
where language was seen as an expression of art.

37
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,709
有什么想分享的新闻吗
Any news you want to share?

38
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,110
班克斯博士 您能打开电视看新闻台吗
Dr. Banks, can you turn the TV to a news channel?

39
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,472
警察已经在该处周边区域
...but police have already set up a blockade

40
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,834
设置了封锁
here around the area.

41
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,230
如你所见 我们尽了最大可能走近
As you can see, we've got just about as close as we can,

42
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,588
但不幸的是
but unfortunately,

43
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,995
蒙大拿现在是完全封锁的状态
Montana right now is on complete lockdown.

44
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,152
该物体是在40分钟前着陆于
The object apparently touched down 40 minutes ago,

45
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,071
94号州际公路的北侧
just north of I-94.

46
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,594
我们在这里等候消息
We're waiting to hear if this is perhaps

47
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,353
看看这是不是一艘实验飞船或是
an experimental vessel or...

48
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,510
稍等
Hold on, it...

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,275
我刚刚得知还有更多像这样的物体
I'm learning that more objects like this have landed in

50
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,595
降落在世界上
as many as eight other locations

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,671
多达八个其他的位置
around the world.

52
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,512
是的 我们能
Yes, can we?

53
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,876
这是来自北海道的画面
This is from a site in Hokkaido.

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,509
这是正在发生的 全球性事件
This is worldwide. It is happening right now.

55
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,397
好吧 呃
Okay. Um...

56
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,352
抱歉 下课吧
I'm sorry. Class is dismissed.

57
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,513
你个笨蛋 直着往我这开
You are an idiot! You drove right into me!

58
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,072
你把我车都撞坏了
You just ruined my car!

59
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,913
现在 在当局对该物体进行评估时
For now, we're simply asking for cooperation

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,070
我们只希望大家能够配合
while authorities assess the object.

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,355
那你的意思是说这不是我们国家的
So, you're saying it's not ours?

62
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,192
你知道它是否来自地球吗
Do you even know if it's from Earth?

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,656
我们目前还在搜集信息
We 're still collecting information.

64
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,976
还有与其他国家进行协调
We're coordinating with other countries.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,831
我们不是唯一一个在境内出现
We're not the only ones to

66
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,115
这么个东西的国家
have one of these in our backyard.

67
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,192
如果这是某种和平的第一类接触
If this is some sort of peaceful first contact,

68
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,833
为什么发来12个
why send 12?

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,638
为什么不就派一艘来
Why not just one?

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,355
是啊 我知道 我看到那个了
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

71
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,316
嗯
Uh-huh.

72
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,198
嗯 妈我不知道
Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom.

73
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,959
我和您看的是一样的新闻
I'm watching the same news coverage you are.

74
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,078
行了 妈 您别理那些电视台
Well, Mom, please don't bother with that channel.

75
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,034
我跟您说过多少次了 那些人都是笨蛋
How many times do I have to tell you? Those people are idiots.

76
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,550
是啊 行了 我听起来紧张吗
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

77
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,391
是 可不嘛
Okay. Exactly. So...

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,149
我 是啊 您懂我的
Um, me? Yeah, um, you know me.

79
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,071
还那么回事
I'm about the same.

80
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
妈 我挺好的
Mom, I'm fine.

81
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,913
好啦 我会再给您打的 再见
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,513
从降临到现在大约八小时
And around eight hours after landing,

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,480
目前还没有任何被称为第一类接触
there are still no signs of what might be called

84
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,919
的迹象
"First contact."

85
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,828
现在 物体至少有一千五百英尺高
Now, the objects measure at least 1,500 feet tall...

86
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,520
报告称有两个物体进入俄罗斯领空
Two are reported to have penetrated Russian airspace.

87
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,036
一个在西伯利亚 另一个在黑海沿岸的
One in Siberia, and the other off the coast of the Black...

88
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,792
海洋上面
...above the ocean.

89
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,275
目前 共有十二个不明物体
So far, there are 12 unidentified objects

90
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,713
分布全球
spread across the globe.

91
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
从其位置上来看并无逻辑
There is no obvious logic to their locations

92
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,113
没有证据表明这些飞船正在运行
and no evidence that the ships are even occu...

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,715
有这种考虑 即这可能是一种
...entertain the idea that if it is a kind of vessel,

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,189
无人驾驶的飞船
it may be unmanned.

95
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,317
无论如何 我们有应对此类事态的预案
Regardless, we have a protocol for scenarios like this.

96
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,029
在星期二的特别事件之后
After Tuesday's extraordinary events,

97
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,112
总统今晨宣布进入紧急状态
the President this morning has declared a state of emergency,

98
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,997
仅在蒙大拿州就部署了
with as many as 5,000 National Guard

99
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,275
有五千名国民警卫队
being deployed to the state of Montana alone.

100
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,874
边境被封锁 航班被停飞
Borders are closed and flights have been grounded,

101
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,757
有上百万的游客被滞留
stranding millions of travelers.

102
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,189
人们疯狂抢购汽油 水和食物
Panic buying of gas, water and food

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,038
事态持续扩大
continues to escalate,

104
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,936
联邦政府暂时解除了
and federal authorities have temporarily lifted

105
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,918
对执法部门的所有加班禁令
all caps on overtime for law enforcement.

106
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,873
烟酒枪械管理局已经暂时停止发放新的持枪许可
The ATF has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses,

107
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,030
迫使许多的狩猎设备和武器
forcing many independent suppliers of

108
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,111
的独立供应商不得不
hunting equipment and firearms

109
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,117
暂停对公众开放
to close their doors to the public.

110
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,515
已经四十八小时过去了 在十二个不明飞行的降落地
Forty-eight hours later and no further development...

111
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,828
两天了
Two days...

112
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,638
还没有任何进展
...from the site of the 12 UFOs.

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,352
公众已经在期待我们
...and already, the public expects us

114
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,271
来了解答案
to know the answers.

115
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,311
我是韦伯上校
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

116
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,229
我们从未正式见过面
We never formally met,

117
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,096
不过两年前 你为军方情报部做过
but two years ago, you did some Farsi translations

118
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,553
波斯语的翻译
for Army Intelligence.

119
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,755
哦
Oh.

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,479
你对那些叛乱者的视频翻译的效率挺高的
You made quick work of those insurgent videos.

121
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,750
你对叛乱者的处理效率也挺高的
You made quick work of those insurgents.

122
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,992
凡是涉及到翻译
You are on the top of everyone's list

123
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,435
你是公认最顶尖的
when it comes to translations.

124
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,229
你的单一范围背景调查还有两年的权限
And you have another two years in your SSBI,

125
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,390
所以你仍有接触最高机密的许可
so you still have top-secret clearance.

126
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,756
这就是为什么我会出现在你的办公室里 而不是在伯克利
That's why I'm in your office and not at Berkeley.

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,352
好吧
Okay.

128
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,108
我想请你翻译些东西
I have something I need you to translate for me.

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,277
你们为什么来这里
Why are you here?

130
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,960
你们 你们能理解我们的语言吗
Can you... Can you understand us?

131
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,839
你们从哪里来
Where did you come from?

132
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,359
现在你听过了 你有什么想法吗
Now you heard it. What do you make of it?

133
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,272
那就是
Is that...

134
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,992
是的
Yes.

135
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,957
有多少
How many?

136
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,875
-什么有多少 -有多少在说话
- How many what? - Um, how many, um, speaking?

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,513
两个
Two.

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,356
假设它们不是同时在说话
Assume they were not speaking at the same time.

139
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,557
你确定吗 它们有嘴吗
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

140
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,070
你要是翻译这个的话 你怎么做
How would you approach translating this?

141
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,071
你有没有听到什么词汇 短语
Do you hear any words? Phrases?

142
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,197
我不 我不知道
I don't... I don't know.

143
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,998
那你能告诉我什么吗
So what can you tell me?

144
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,275
我能说的就是不可能仅根据音频文件
I can tell you that it's impossible

145
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,316
来翻译这些
to translate from an audio file.

146
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,517
我得亲自到现场 跟它们进行互动
I would need to be there, to interact with them.

147
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,558
做波斯语翻译的时候你也没互动啊
You didn't need that with the Farsi translations.

148
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,438
我不需要是因为我会波斯语
I didn't need it because I already knew the language,

149
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,630
但是这个 这是 呃
but this... This is... Ah...

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,869
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're doing.

151
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,878
-那你说说我在要干嘛 -我是不会带你去蒙大拿的
- Tell me what I'm doing. - I'm not taking you to Montana.

152
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,056
我不能让别人把最高机密许可
It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site

153
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,376
当成旅游景点的门票
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

154
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,391
我只是告诉你完成这项工作
I'm just telling you what it would take

155

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,953
你刚才说伯克利
You mentioned Berkeley.

161
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,355
接下来你是不是要去询问丹佛斯
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

162
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,754
可能吧
Maybe.

163
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,229
在你让他工作之前
Before you commit to him,

164
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,955
问问他梵文里战争一词及其翻译
ask him the Sanskrit word for war and its translation.

165
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,315
在今晚的中国和俄罗斯在联合国加入磋商后

一个科学发现共享协议
as Russia and China join talks at the United Nations.

168
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,270
与此同时 世界范围内的金融市场处于危机中
Meanwhile, financial markets across the world are in crisis

169
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,510
道琼斯工业指数下跌
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell

170
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,192
超过两千点
over 2,000 points...

171
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
早上好
Morning.

172
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
上校
Colonel?

173
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,313
伽维斯提
Gavisti.

174
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,311
他说这表示“争论”
He says it means "An argument."

175
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,879
你觉得那个词是什么意思
What do you say it means?

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,513
渴望更多的牛
A desire for more cows.

177
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,153
装好你的行李

Contact and ready to approach...

181
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
抱歉 班克斯博士 我来检查一下你的安全带
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make sure you're properly secured.

182
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,508
你还好吗
You okay?

183
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,553
对不起 我刚才没听见你在说什么
Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying.

184
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,552
“语言”是文明的基石
"Language is the foundation of civilization.

185
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,029
它是将人们联结在一起的胶水
"It is the glue that holds a people together.

186
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,953
它是在冲突中最先使用的武器

露易丝 这是伊恩・唐纳利 露易丝・班克斯 伊恩・唐纳利
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly. Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

188
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,279
这就是打过招呼了
That's quite a greeting.

189
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,277
是啊 你写的这个
Yeah, well, you wrote it.

190
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,958
嗯
Yeah.

191
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,469
这就是你写来做序言的东西
It's the kind of thing you write as a preface.

192
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,636
博得读者眼球
Dazzle them with the basics.

193
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,797
是 挺好的 即便是错的
Yeah, it's great. Even if it's wrong.

194
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,150
错了
It's wrong?

195
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,549
嗯 文明的基石不是语言
Well, the cornerstone of civilization isn't language,

196
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,073
而是科学
it's science.

197
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,751
伊恩是来自阿拉莫斯国家实验室的理论物理学家
Ian is a theoretical physicist from Los Alamos.

198
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,936
你向我汇报 但当你在壳里时
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be working with him

199
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,439
你和他一起共事
when you're in the shell.

200
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,591
它们管那个不明飞行物叫壳
That's what they're calling the UFO.

201
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,150
首要目的 它们从何来 何所求
Priority one: what do they want and where are they from?

202
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,715
除此以外 它们是怎么来到这里的
And beyond that, how did they get here?

203
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
它们能进行超光速旅行吗
Are they capable of faster-than-light travel?

204
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,955
我准备了一系列的问题要问
I've prepared a list of questions to go over,

205
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,191
以二进制序列的“握手”为开始
starting with a series of "Handshake" Binary sequences...

206
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,838
我们能不能在向它们问数学题之前
How about we just talk to them

207
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,269
先跟它们交流起来
before we start throwing math problems at them?

208
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,676
这就是为什么同时请了你们俩
This is why you're both here.

209
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,272
我来端咖啡
I'll bring the coffee.

210
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,391
与外星人一起喝咖啡
Coffee with some aliens.

211
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,953
你带他们两个去凯特勒博士那里去
I want you to take these two to Dr. Kettler.

212
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,838
遵命 长官

213
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
请跟着这位上尉去医务室
Follow the captain to medical.

214
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,272
这只需要几分钟就好
It should take just a few minutes,

215
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,430
然后我们就开始
and then we'll get started.

216
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,795
把背包交给我们 请把手机交给我
We'll take care of your bag. I'll take your cell phones.

217
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,757
手机拿出来

218
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,791
跟着我
Follow me.

219
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,633
把这些穿上 你们得一直穿着它们
Put these on. You're gonna wear them at all times.

220
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,913
长官 他们到了
Sir, they're here.

221
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,472
露易丝・班克斯 伊恩・唐纳利
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

222
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,456
你们上一顿饭什么时候吃的
When was the last time either of you have eaten?

223
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,799
-昨晚 -我也是
- Last night. - Same.

224
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,736
上一次在压力状态下做事
Last time you did something stressful?

225
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,478
现在算吗
Does now count?

226
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,319
开个玩笑
Just saying...

227
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,153
哦 被抬进救伤直升机的是谁
Uh, who was being carted off in the medevac?

228
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,750
不是所有人都可以经受住这样的经历的
Not everyone is able to process experiences like this.

229
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,751
我需要抽一些你的血
I'm gonna get some blood from you

230
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,398
然后给你打一针疫苗
and give you an immunization dose

231
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,670
能抵御多种细菌威胁
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

232
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,837
请你在这里签个字 把袖子撸上去
Could you sign these, please? And roll up your sleeves.

233
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,359
你们谁有幽闭恐惧症
Either of you claustrophobic?

234
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,839
-没有 -没有
- No. - No.

235
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,434
目前有没有在用药 对什么过敏
Currently taking any medications? Allergies?

236
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,999
有怀孕吗
Pregnant?

237
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,513
没有
No.

238
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,676
加强剂会对你的身体系统产生冲击
The booster is a kick to your system,

239
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,916
所以你会感觉到一些副作用
so you may experience some side effects,

240
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,598
比如恶心 头晕 头疼
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

241
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,353
耳鸣之类的
a ringing in your ears, like you have tinnitus.

242
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,431
他们不管怎样都不离开
They wouldn't go, either way.

243
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,711
你看到他怎么了吗
You see what's happening to him?

244
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
这到底是怎么运行的
How does this even work?

245
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,416
读数没变化
The readings do not change,

246
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,634
但 我不懂
but I don't know,

247
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
就好像我们是一片纸上的虫子
it's like we're insects on a piece of paper,

248
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
他们在让我们自己撤退
and they're easing us out of the house.

249
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,953
在一百一十二分钟十九秒后
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,

250
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,316
重力开始起变化 让我们滑出房间
gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room.

251
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,472
对此你有科学解释吗
Have you found a scientific explanation for it?

252
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,959
比如 这对它们来说有利
Like, is it for them?

253
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,951
哦 不 我觉得是为我们方便的
Uh, no. We think it's for us.

254
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,713
在房间内部的空气似乎并不流通
Air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber,

255
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,479
所以两小时后 我们的氧气就消耗光了
so after about two hours, we run out of oxygen.

256
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,155
往那个房间泵送空气用不了十八个小时
It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room.

257
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,719
大气
Atmosphere...

258
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,913
你说什么
Excuse me?

259
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,070
如果它们的大气和地球上的不一样
If their atmosphere is different from Earth,

260
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,553
在它们每次打开舱门之前
it would certainly take hours

261
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,910
它们得将氧气含量及气压进行重新调整
to rebalance their O2 content and pressure for us

262
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,911
已达到我们的适应范围内
every time they open their door.

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,389
那么你是说它们能令我们窒息 如果它们想的话
So, they could suffocate us if they wanted.

264
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,312
这位是来自中情局的哈尔彭特工
This is Agent Halpern with the CIA.

265
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,755
我带你们去你们的工位
Let me get you two to your stations.

266
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,068
好的 长官
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,919
记住 我们得尽快得到答案
Remember, we need answers as soon as possible.

268
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,752
它们何所求 来自何方
What do they want? Where are they from?

269
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,159
以及为什么来这里
Why are they here?

270
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,508
这是首要任务
This is the priority.

271
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,511
大家 这位是伊恩・唐纳利博士
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.

272
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,272
他负责带领这个队
He'll be running this team here.

273
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,430
它们有没有对什么作出反应
Have they responded to anything?

274
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
形状 模式 数字 斐波那契数列
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

275
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,496
当它们回复“你好”的时候
We can't tell what they're saying

276
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,431
我们并不知道它们在说什么
when they respond to "Hello," So...

277
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,191
别太急于求成
Don't get ahead of yourself.

278
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,032
你们得出什么了
What have you figured out?

279
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,157
我们这才刚刚开始 各位早上好
We're just getting started. Good morning!

280
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,152
这是露易丝・班克斯博士 她负责带你们队
This is Dr. Louise Banks. She'll be heading your team.

281
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,673
很高兴见到你
It's a pleasure meeting you.

282
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
班克斯博士接手沃克博士的任务
Dr. Banks is taking over the mission from Dr. Walker.

283
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,349
那是一个十五分钟警报
That's a 15-minute warning.

284
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,391
你以前潜过水吗
You scuba-dive before?

285
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,828
我们要去的地方有哪种辐射
What kind of radiation exposure are we walking into?

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,229
就是形式上的以防万一 为安全考虑
Nominal. These are just for safety.

287
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,959
那么 有没有和那些的肢体接触
So, is there any physical contact with the, um...

288
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,759
有人和我一样讲不出“外星人”吗
Am I the only one having trouble saying "Aliens"?

289
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,717
那里有一面墙 像是玻璃墙
There's a wall. Like, a glass wall.

290
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,472
你碰不到它们
You can't get to them.

291
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,519
它们长什么样子
So, what do they look like?

292
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,716
你马上就能看到了 加快
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

293
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,313
防护服一开始很笨重
The suits are clumsy at first,

294
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,436
但你会习惯的
but you get used to them.

295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,791
我开第二辆车
I'll open a second vehicle.

296
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,237
我们几分钟就到
We'll be there in a few minutes.

297
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
确保你把住什么东西
Make sure you hold on to something.

298
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,195
收到 秃鹰 我们会监视 但不启动 完毕

小心
Watch your step.

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,436
我们会保持阿尔法频道畅通 完毕
We'll keep Alpha channel open. Over.

301
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,034
阿尔法 请注意 湿度从昨天开始增加了
Alpha, be advised. Humidity increased since yesterday.

302
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,111
每隔十八小时
Every 18 hours,

303
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,435
底部的门就会打开
the door opens up at the bottom.

304
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,672
这就是我们要去的地方
That's where we go in.

363
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,758

364
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,319
防护服

365
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,312

你比上一个好多了
You're better than the last guy.

372
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,040
这没有让我好受些
That doesn't make me feel any better.

373
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,717
到凌晨两点你们还有些思考的时间
You both have till 02:00 hours to figure something out.

375
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,992
你们再去
You go back in.

376
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,030
十二处着陆的发现
Violence continues to spread

377
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,953
使得暴力在美国持续蔓延

对连续三天晚上的打砸抢

00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,515
镇压失败后
after the crackdown by the National Guard failed

381
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,353
总统下达了对黄昏到黎明的宵禁命令
to prevent a third night of looting across the country.

382
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,398
在南达科他州 一百四十四个
In North Dakota, 144 members of

383
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,198
圣劳伦斯五旬节派成员
the Saint Lawrence Pentecostal Cult

384
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,192
在点燃易燃物后死亡
are feared dead after they set their compound ablaze.

385
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,714
他们网站上宣称外星人的到来
Their website claims the arrival of the aliens

386
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,472
说明了一个预言
set in motion a prophesy that...

387
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,392
我们将在十五分钟后行动 你有什么新信息吗
Uh, we're up in 15. You got any new intel?

388
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,473
是的 我们有一些他们的声音
Yeah, we've been playing back some of their sounds.

389
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,198
你们怎么得到的
Where does that get you?

390
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,952
他们向我们发出了声音
Well, they play audio back at us,

391
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,156
从一个看不见的地方
from an unseen source.

392
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,753
什么的声音
Audio of what?

393
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,035
他们在房间里的一些交流
Uh, it's bits of conversation from the room.

随意的对话片段

395
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,348
说真的 我们什么都没得到
Really, we have nothing.

396
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,195
距出发十四分钟
T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.

397
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,236
距出发十四分钟
T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.

398
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,233
距出发九分钟
T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.

399
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,312
距出发九分钟
T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.

400
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,913
那是干什么的
What's that for?

401
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,911
视觉辅助手段
A visual aid.

402
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,673
听着 我永远都不可能说他们的语言
Look, I'm never gonna be able to speak their words,

403
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,352
假设他们说的是种语言的话
if they are talking,

404
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,273
但他们可能会有一些书面语言
but they might have some sort of written language

405
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,271
或用于视觉交流的东西
or basis for visual communication.

406
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,749
好的 我们开始吧
Okay. Let's get started.

407
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,234
人类
Human.

408
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,593
人类
"Human."

409
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,793
我是人类 你们呢
I'm human. What are you?

410
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,752
人类
Human.

411
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,189
我的天哪
Oh my God!

412
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,469
你记录下来了吗
Are you getting this?

413
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,949
是的 长官 我正把这个传回营地
Yes, sir! It's uploading back to base camp.

414
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,711
露易丝 这太不可思议了
Louise, that's incredible.

415
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,071
人类
Human.

416
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,199
人类
Human.

417
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,596
好的 慢一点
Okay, slow down now.

418
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,919
慢一点
Slow down.

419
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,430
我不想打击你的成功
I don't wanna take away from your success in there,

420
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,988
但是 班克斯博士 这真的是正确的方法吗
but Dr. Banks, is this really the right approach?

421
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,311
尝试教给他们说和读
Trying to teach them how to speak and read?

422
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,197
这要花费更长时间
That's gotta take longer.

423
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,590
你错了 这更快
You're wrong. It's faster.

424
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,259
你在那做的每件事
Everything you do in there,

425
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,599
我都要给一屋子的人解释
I have to explain to a room full of men

426
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,511
他们的问题都是
whose first and last question is...

427
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,636
这将怎样被用来对付我们
"How can this be used against us?"

428
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,439
所以你要给我更多的解释
So you're gonna have to give me more than that.

429
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,478
袋鼠
Kangaroo.

430
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,794
那是什么
What is that?

431
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,393
在一七七零年
In 1770,

432
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,277
詹姆斯・库克船长的船
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

433
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,634
在澳大利亚海边搁浅
off the coast of Australia,

434
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,472
他带了一队人深入
and he led a party into the country,

435
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,198
遇到了土著人
and they met the Aboriginal people.

436
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,759
一个水手指着
One of the sailors pointed at

437
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,598
跳来跳去
the animals that hop around

438
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,398
将它们的孩子放在育儿袋中的动物
and put their babies in their pouch,

439
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,152
问它们是什么
and he asked what they were,

440
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,356
土著人回答 Kangaroo[袋鼠]
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

441
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,434
你想说什么
And the point is?

442
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,296
没过多久他们知道了
It wasn't till later that they learned that

443
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,073
Kangaroo的意思是我听不懂 所以
"Kangaroo" Means "I don't understand." So,

444
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,232
我这么做是为了我们不把那里的事情翻译错
I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there.

445
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
否则 将会花费十倍以上的时间
Otherwise, this is gonna take 10 times as long.

446
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,034
现在我接受你的解释
I can sell that for now.

447
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,480
但是在下次进去之前
But I need you to submit your vocabulary words

448
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,913
我需要你上交你的词汇
before the next session.

449
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,513
好的
Fair.

450
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,989
记住土著人所遭受的苦难
And remember what happened to the Aborigines.

451
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,068
一个更加高级的种族几乎将他们赶尽杀绝
A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.

452
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,873
那是个好故事
It's a good story.

453
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,353
谢谢
Thanks.

454
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,952
假的
It's not true.

455
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,156
但它证明了我的观点
But it proves my point.

456
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
我认为我们可以复制一些基本数字序列
We think we were able to reproduce

457
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,119
发回给他们
some prime number sequences back at them.

458
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,468
还是小有成就的
So that's something.

459
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,154
那么 祝贺你 你像只鹦鹉
Well, congratulations. You're a parrot.

460
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,856
比那难多了 你个混蛋
It's a lot more than that, you cheeky bastard,

461
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,995
你没看到吗
don't you see?

462
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,071
他们似乎不懂我们的代数
They can't seem to follow our algebra,

463
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,036
但是复杂的行为 他们懂
but complex behaviors, that clicks.

464
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,909
这根本说不通 不是吗
Well that doesn't make any sense at all, does it?

465
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,016
问题是 不是每个人都理解我们
Problem is, not everyone shares our policy

466
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,996
向外星人的开放态度
of being open with the aliens.

467
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,071
你见过尚将军吗
Have you met General Shang?

468
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,355
他的命令就像多米诺骨牌
The call sign for him is Big Domino.

469
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,668
不管尚将军干什么
Whatever Shang does,

470
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,512
至少有四个国家会跟随他
at least four other nations will follow.

471
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,750
露易丝 我们今天要上去
Louise? We have to gain ground today.

472
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,279
好的
Okay.

473
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,756
-你的词汇表呢 -在这
- You have a vocabulary list for me? - I do.

474
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,276
你准备教他们你和伊恩的名字
You're gonna teach them your name and Ian's?

475
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,873
是的 这样我们就能知道他们的名字了
Yes, so that we can learn

476
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,598
如果他们有名字的话
their names if they have names,

477
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,517
然后教给他们代词
and then introduce pronouns later.

478
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,192
这些都是小学单词
These are all grade-school words:

479
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,589
吃 走
eat, walk.

480
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,672
解释一下
Help me understand.

481
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,358
好的
Okay. Um...

482
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,551
噢 不不不 别擦上边
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!

483
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,195
好的 这是你想知道的 对吗
Okay, this is where you wanna get to, right?

484
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
-是的 -好的
- That is the question. - Okay.

485
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,035
所以 首先我们需要确保
So, first, we need to make sure that

486
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,230
他们知道什么是问题
they understand what a question is.

487
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,108
那么 问题的本质就是
Okay, the nature of a request for information

488
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,758
带有答案的信息
along with a response.

489
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,072
接着 我们需要让他们分清
Then, we need to clarify the difference between

490
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,277
个体的你和集体的你
a specific "You" And a collective "You,"

491
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,512
因为我们不想知道为什么其中的一个人来了
because we don't wanna know why Joe Alien is here,

492
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,473
我们想知道的是为什么他们全都来了
we want to know why they all landed.

493
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,990
理解“目的”需要引入“意图”这个概念
And purpose requires an understanding of intent.

494
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,354
我们需要搞清楚
We need to find out:

495
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,391
他们能做有意识的决定吗
do they make conscious choices?

496
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,596
或者说他们的动机是本能的
Or is their motivation so instinctive

497
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,717
他们并不能理解什么是问题
that they don't understand a "Why" Question at all?

498
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,313
最重要的是
And... And biggest of all,

499
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,595
我们需要和他们有足够多的词汇
we need to have enough vocabulary with them

500
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,438
以便理解他们的答案
that we understand their answer.

501
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,598
我明白了
I get it.

502
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,035
按照你的词汇表来
Stick to your list.

503
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,599
只是
Just

504
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,391
不要增加任何东西
don't add anything to it.

505
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,916
...是二点九七
...are at 2.97.

506
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,076
氧气含量 百分之二十一点四 完毕
Oxygen level: 21.4%. Over.

507
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,760
秃鹰 阿尔法现在在中厅
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

508
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,678
设置好装备和遥感系统 完毕
Setting up equipment and telemetry. Over.

509
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,273
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

510
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,272
露易丝 露易丝 我是露易丝
Louise. Louise. I am Louise.

511
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,756
那是什么
What is that?

512
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,432
那是一个新符号吗 我看不懂
Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.

513
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,233
我不知道 我认为那还是人类的意思
I don't know. I think it's the symbol for human again.

514
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,629
他只是在尾部加了一点弯曲
It just has a little curl on the end,

515
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,637
可能是问句的意思
maybe to indicate a question.

516
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,432
我不知道
I don't know.

517
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,709
我不知道 露易丝
I don't know, Louise.

518
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,109
我认为他们很疑惑
I think they're getting confused.

519
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,673
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks,

520
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,955
你可以进行下一个单词了
perhaps we should move on to the next word.

521
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,793
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks!

522
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
我没事
It's okay.

523
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
发生了什么
What's going on?

524
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,879
嘿 你在干嘛呢
Hey! What are you doing?

525
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,228
没事 我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

526
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,958
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

527
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,718
他们需要看清我
They need to see me.

528
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,631
她把防护服脱了
She's taking off her hazmat suit.

529
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
这可以吗
Is it okay?

530
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,616
你有被感染的危险
You're risking contamination.

531
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,073
他们需要看请我
They need to see me.

532
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,633
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks...

533
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,875
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks.

534
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,269
她向屏幕走去了
She's walking towards the screen.

535
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,718
我们要中止任务吗
Should we abort?

536
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,234
请求收到 等待后续命令
Recourse noted. Stand by for further orders.

537
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,959
回到自己的位置上去
Go back to your stations.

538
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,910
这才是合适的自我介绍 嘿
Now that's a proper introduction. Hey.

539
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,031
露易丝
Louise.

540
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,158
我是露易丝
I am Louise.

541
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,471
伊恩 你想介绍下你自己吗
Ian, do you want to introduce yourself?

542
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,433
好
Uh, yeah.

543
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,436
露易丝
Louise.

544
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,798
管它呢
Screw it!

545
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,636
每个人都会死 对吗
Everybody dies, right?

546
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,836
长官 唐纳利脱掉了防护服
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his hazmat suit.

547
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,190
请求中止
Permission to abort?

548
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,952
继续
Continue the session.

549
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,718
伊恩
Ian.

550
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,313
露易丝
Louise.

551
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,432
你们
You...

552
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,358
你们呢
Who are you?

553
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,358
我认为这是他们的名字
I think those are their names.

554
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,757
它们有名字
They have names.

555
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,149
所以 我们要叫他们什么呢
So, what are we gonna call them?

556
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,838
我不知道
I don't know.

557
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,355
艾伯特和科斯特洛怎么样
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

558
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,752
可以
Yeah.

559

哇哦
Wow!

562
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,269
一队 下车
Team 1, exit your vehicle

563
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,035
直接去消毒营
and proceed directly ahead to the decontamination tent.

564
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,716
开着呼吸器直到进入仪器室
Leave your respirator on until you reach the equipment room.

565
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,599
我知道 嘘
I know. Shhh!

566
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,072
二队 下车
Team 2, exit your vehicles

567
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,630
去消毒营
and continue to the decontamination tent.

568
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,278
开着呼吸机
Leave your respirators on

569
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,952
在到达仪器室之前
and do not hesitate

570
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,871
不要停下
until you have reached the equipment room.

571
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,473
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

572
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,317
精疲力竭
Overworked.

573
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,391
我猜不需要我告诉你
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

574
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,959
你把自己置于危险之中
you're putting yourself at risk.

575
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,516
还没有发现有毒放射物
There's no signs of radiation poisoning yet.

576
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,319
看看你的血液检测情况
We'll see how your blood tests look.

577
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,960
现在 我要给你另一种药
For now, I'm gonna give you another boost.

578
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,439
好的
Okay.

579
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,317
没有放射物
No radiation.

580
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,072
也没有检测到其他物质
Nothing else we can detect either,

581
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,549
但我还是要给他们打一针混合疫苗
but I'd give them a strong cocktail, regardless.

582
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,438
这是我们第一次取得这么大的进步
It's the first time we've made significant progress.

583
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,994
好吧 这风险我们担了
All right. We'll take the risk.

584
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,433
好了 亲爱的
Okay, honey...

585
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,896
那里发生了什么
What is going on there?

586
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,069
亲爱的
Honey...

587
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,355
告诉我
Just tell me!

588
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,351
你不需要担心 好吗
You don't need to worry, okay?

589
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,113
-我怎么能不担心 -冷静点
- How can I not worry? - Just calm down.

590
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,713
冷静下来
Just calm down.

591
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,588
贝基问我怪兽会不会把爸爸杀了
Becky asked me if the monsters are going to kill Daddy!

592
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,274
亲爱的 这不会发生的
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

593
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,159
你要好好的
Just stay safe.

594
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,639
你不需要担心
You don't need to worry.

595
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,751
求你了 我好害怕
Please! I'm so scared!

596
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,791
所有低级别外国语言学研究者
All junior xenolinguistics

597
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,030
和科学人员一定要遵守
and science personnel must observe

598
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,759
全体宵禁 除非得到指挥官特别授权
general curfew unless expressly authorized

599
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,479
可以延长工作时间
for extended work hours by unit COs.

600
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,155
有效宵禁时间截止到两千二百小时
Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.

601
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,838
所有的加班工作人员 火灾警戒员 和值夜班的人
Notice to all late workers, fire watchers and night staff.

602
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,357
整晚都有物品供应
Effective immediately, midnight rations will be served all night.

603
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,590
我们对于七脚怪
Here are some of the many things

604
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,711
还是一无所知
we don't know about heptapods.

605
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,111
希腊语中 Hepta指的是七 Pod指的是脚
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

606
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
七只脚 七脚怪
Seven feet. Heptapod.

607
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,832
他们到底是什么
Who are they?

608
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,753
试图更加深入的了解他们
Trying to answer this in any meaningful way

609
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,598
而现实总是让人失望
is hampered by the fact that,

610
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,598
在外面 能看见他们的样子 听见他们的声音
outside being able to see them and hear them,

611
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,757
但七脚怪完全没有留下任何踪迹
the heptapods leave absolutely no footprint.

612
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,029
对其飞船的化学分析也没有任何结果
The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown.

613
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,351
壳体不会产出废料 不会排出气体 也没有辐射
The shell emits no waste, no gas, no radiation.

614
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,671
假设这些壳体之间能够交流
Assuming that the shells communicate with each other,

615
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,354
却不被人类所发现
they do so without detection.

616
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,954
壳体之间的空气不会
The air between the shells is untroubled

617
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,991
受到声波和光波的影响
by sonic emission or light wave.

618
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,034
那他们是科学家吗 还是游客
Are they scientists? Or tourists?

619
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,519
假设他们科学家
If they're scientists,

620
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,909
但并没有询问一大堆的问题
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

621
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,269
为什么他们停在了这儿
Why did they park where they did?

622
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,870
世界上最有学识的专家也无法解释
The world's most decorated experts can't crack that one.

623
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,552
最有可能的原因是
The most plausible theory is

624
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,119
他们选择停在地球上
that they chose places on Earth

625
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,708
几乎不会有闪电的地方
with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes.

626
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,791
但是也有例外
But there are exceptions.

627
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,871
另一个可能理论是
The next most plausible theory is that

628
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,552
在1980年 希娜・伊斯顿的歌曲
Sheena Easton had a hit song

629
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,153
在这些地方红极一时
at each of these sites in 1980.

630
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,878
因此我们还是一无所知
So, we just don't know.

631
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,869
他们是怎样交流的
How do they communicate?

632
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,072
露易丝在这儿使我们自惭形秽
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

633
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,832
取得的第一个突破是
The first breakthrough was

634
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
发现了七脚怪所说的话
to discover that there's no correlation

635
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,309
和所写的字之间没有任何关联
between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.

636
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,595
和所有人类文字不同的是
Unlike all written human languages,

637
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,194
他们使用的是意符文字
their writing is semasiographic.

638
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,750
文字代表了意思 但不代表发音
It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.

639
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,390
可能他们觉得我们的文字
Perhaps they view our form of writing

640
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,789
完全是多此一举
as a wasted opportunity,

641
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,480
浪费了一次交流的机会
passing up a second communications channel.

642
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,438
我们得感谢在巴基斯坦的朋友
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

643
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,512
对七脚怪文字的研究
for their study of how heptapods write,

644
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,553
因为不像说话 意音文字不会随着时间改变其意思
because unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.

645
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,471
就像他们的飞船和身体一样
Like their ship or their bodies,

646
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,915
他们的文字不存在
their written language has no forward

647
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,353
具体的顺序
or backward direction.

648
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,319
语言学家称其为非线性拼写法
Linguists call this non-linear orthography,

649
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,790
这不由的让人怀疑 他们也是这么思考的吗
which raises the question, "Is this how they think?"

650
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,751
想象一下你要用双手写一个句子
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands,

651
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,398
分别从两边开始书写
starting from either side.

652
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,631
你必须清楚你想要用的每个词语
You would have to know each word you wanted to use,

653
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,518
和它们所占据的空间的大小
as well as how much space they would occupy.

654
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,796
七脚怪能毫不费力
A heptapod can write a complex sentence

655
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,996
在两秒中内写一个复杂的句子
in two seconds, effortlessly.

656
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,958
而人类要用一个月才做出简单的回复
It's taken us a month to make the simplest reply.

657
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,032
关于七脚怪如何扩充词汇
Next, expanding vocabulary.

658
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,896
路易斯认为至少需要一个月
Louise thinks it could easily take another month

659
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,433
才能弄明白
to be ready for that.

660
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,432
嘿
Hey...

661
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,112
你好
Oh, hey.

662
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,390
韦伯在找你
Weber's looking for you.

663
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,199
我知道 不然我为什么躲在这里
Yeah, well, why do you think I'm hiding out here?

664
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,273
上来吧
Come on up!

665
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,793
谢谢
Thanks.

666
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,755
这儿真美 对吧
Nice out here, huh?

667
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,195
确实 风景很美
Yeah, it's a nice view.

668
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,475
远离那些噪音
Away from the noise.

669
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,755
你知道吗 我刚正好想到你
You know, I was just thinking about you.

670
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,710
你像数学家那样解决语言问题
You approach language like a mathematician.

671
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,951
我没猜错吧
You know that, right?

672
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,315
我就当你在夸我
I will take that as a compliment.

673
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,873
就是在夸你啊
Yeah, well, it is.

674
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,908
当你指导我们绕过那些
As I watch you steer us around these communication traps

675
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,070
我根本没有察觉的语言陷阱
that I didn't even know existed,

676
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,912
心里在说 什么
it's like, "What?"

677
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,997
我猜这就是我单身的原因
I guess that's why I'm single.

678
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,157
相信我 就算你懂得如何沟通
Trust me, you can understand communication

679
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,918
到最后依然还是单身
and still end up single.

680
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,436
我感觉里面发生的所有事
I feel like everything that happens in there

681
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,636
都要靠我们俩解决了
comes down to the two of us.

682
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,671
那难道不是件好事吗
Yeah, that's a good thing though, right?

683
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,233
你和我
You and I?

684
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,036
看到每天和我们一起工作的废柴
Have you seen the jokers that we're working with?

685
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,673
我就在想 幸好还有你
Thank God I've got you!

686
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,188
今晚
Tonight,

687
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,198
第一张外星人的照片在疯狂传播
the first photograph of the aliens goes viral.

688
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,033
生物污染是蒙大拿存在的
Biological contamination is a major risk factor

689
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,394
最主要的威胁
at the Montana site.

690
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,550
环保组织如是说
So say environmental pressure groups.

691
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,477
在华盛顿 有80万人游行
800,000 march on Washington

692
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,154
抗议政府对危机的处理
to protest the government's handling of the crisis.

693
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,038
接下来会有更多的新闻报道
All this, and more special coverage.

694
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,976
首先和里面的不明物体进行沟通
First contact with whoever it is that is inside that thing,

695
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,319
猜猜谁在操作这场秀
and who's running the show?

696
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,628
当然是政府
The government.

697
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,711
听好了 就是那个
That's right, folks, the same government

698
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,394
破坏了我们的医疗保险 搞砸了我们的军队的政府
who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our military.

699
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,549
看看这些人啊
Look at these people!

700
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,392
大多数都是手无寸铁的老百姓
Most of them don't even have guns!

701
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,471
我们可能会遭遇全面的入侵
We could be facing a full-scale invasion.

702
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,312
我们的总统只是干等着
Our president's willing to sit back

703
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,595
让他们大摇大摆地夺走我们的家园
and let them waltz in and take our country.

704
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,910
我们要玩完了啊
We are falling asleep at the wheel, people!

705
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,235
你们知道我没有胡说八道
You know what I'm talking about. I know you do.

706
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,675
我们现在最应该做的就是
What if the smartest thing we could do right now

707
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,591
展现我们的武力
would be to give them a show of force?

708
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,671
让他们知道我们的厉害
I'm talking about a shot across the bow.

709
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,760
你认为怎么样
What do you think?

710
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,319
第一位来电者 你好
Caller No.1, you're on the air.

711
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,628
发表下你的看法
What do you think?

712
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,632
这个词是什么意思
What's this word?

713
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,153
行星
Planet.

714
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,717
就像地球是一个行星
That's, like, um... The Earth is a planet.

715
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,793
想看看我为伽利略老师课上做的东西吗
Want to see my project for Miss Garriott's class?

716
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,592
当然 小可爱
Yeah, little nose.

717
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,313
我们要自己制作电视节目
We had to make up our own TV show.

718
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,391
如果我们有的话
If we had one.

719
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,000
这两个人是谁
And who are those two people?

720
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,399
你和爸爸
That's you and Dad.

721
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,913
电视名字叫做
The show is called

722
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,150
和小动物们说话的妈妈和爸爸
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

723
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,077
哦
Oh!

724
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,151
太可爱了
Well, it's lovely.

725
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,633
好吧
Okay...

726
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,198
呃
Um...

727
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,909
你可以因为爸爸和妈妈的事情而感到不开心
You know it's okay to be sad that your dad and I...

728
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,513
我知道 我没有
I know. I'm not.

729
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,750
因为我们都很爱你
'Cause we both love you very much.

730
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,434
我知道 只是张卡通画 并不是真的
I know. It's just a cartoon. It's not real.

731
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,112
露易丝
Louise?

732
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,633
你还好吗
You all right?

733
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,831
我挺好的
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

734
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,032
我也不好怎么说
I'm not sure it's something I can... I can explain.

735
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,873
你上次去凯特勒医生那儿检查是什么时候
When was your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?

736
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,718
我没事
I'm okay.

737
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,115
我要去透透气了
I'm gonna get some air.

738
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,236
-我没事了 -好吧
- I'm okay. - All right.

739
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,998
我挺好的
I'm fine. Yep.

740
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,429
你怎么样
How you feeling?

741
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,192
呃
Um...

742
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,917
我想睡一觉 但我挺好的
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

743
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,353
好吧
Yeah.

744
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,910
我看过有关这些的
You know, I was doing some reading, um,

745
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,433
书籍
about this idea

746
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,876
里面说到 如果你沉浸于一门外语中
that if you immerse yourself into a foreign language,

747
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,554
就能重新构建你的大脑
then you can actually rewire your brain.

748
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,551
是萨皮尔沃夫理论
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

749
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,591
对的
Mm-hmm.

750
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,318
这个理论
The theory that, uh...

751
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,391
这个理论说到
It... It's the theory that, uh,

752
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,198
你所说的语言决定了
the language you speak determines

753
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,679
你思维的方式
how you think and...

754
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,228
还会影响你看待事情的态度
Yeah. It affects how you see everything.

755
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,594
这真是
It was, uh...

756
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,716
我很好奇
I'm curious...

757
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,308
你会梦到他们的语言吗
Are you dreaming in their language?

758
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,157
梦到过几次 但是
I may have had a few dreams, but I don't...

759
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,349
我不认为那意味着我不能胜任这份工作
I don't think that that makes me unfit to do this job.

760
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,829
你睡过了吗
Did you sleep?

761
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,109
睡了一会
A little.

762
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,473
你会普通话吗
Do you know Mandarin?

763
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,193
它在移动
It is shifting.

764
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,390
你将听到的声音来自
The voice you're about to hear

765
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,789
中国军队的长官
belongs to a Chinese military chief...

766
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,196
尚将军
General Shang.

767
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,799
带上吧
Pull it up!

768
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,399
这儿有他和别人说话的卫星录像
We got a satellite feed here of who he's talking to,

769
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,391
如果你想看看的话
if you want to look.

770
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,993
等下 倒一点
Wait, go back.

771
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,998
停
Stop.

772
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,916
他说这十二个不明物体
He's saying that each of the 12

773
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,956
会提供高科技
is offering advanced technology.

774
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,435
再倒回去 放吧
Go back again. And play.

775
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
呃
Um...

776
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,159
我们的科学队伍正试图破解密码
"Our science team is attempting to decode the sets."

777
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,160
密码 我不知道那是什么意思
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

778
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,832
一些有利的东西
Something about advantage,

779
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,753
色子 番子 花牌
suits, honor and, uh, flowers.

780
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,398
我不
I don't...

781
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,356
我不知道
I don't know. That's all.

782
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,829
我不知道那什么意思
I don't know what it means either.

783
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,309
一个小时前 中国调动了军队
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

784
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,834
现在 俄罗斯也紧随其后
And now, Russia's following suit.

785
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,275
尚要开始搞事情了
Shang's about to start something.

786
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,351
跟着服装 服装
Following suit. Suits.

787
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,033
色子 番子 花牌
Suits, honor, flowers...

788
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,873
上校 那些全是麻将里面的牌
Colonel, those are all tile sets in mah-jongg.

789
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,477
我的天
God, are they...

790
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,757
他们用麻将和七脚怪交流吗
Are they using a game to converse with their heptapods?

791
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,390
可能 为什么
Maybe. Why?

792
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,910
打个比方 如果我们教他们下棋 而非英语
Well, let's say that I taught them chess instead of English.

793
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,036
每场对话都可以是一场游戏
Every conversation would be a game.

794
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,192
每个想法都可以通过对完之后的输和赢来表达
Every idea expressed through opposition, victory, defeat.

795
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,594
你明白了吗
You see the problem?

796
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,398
我知道了
Hmm...

797
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,710
如果我只给你一个锤子
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

798
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,677
那么所有事都是钉子
Everything's a nail.

799
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,475
我们得问出那个问题了
We need to ask the big question.

800
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,318
准备好了吗
Ready or not.

801
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,390
我懂了 但在那之间
Yeah, I know, but between there and there.

802
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,310
是时候出发了
Well, it's time to go.

803
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,677
好的
Okay...

804
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,155
七脚怪的目的
Heptapods' purpose.

805
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,315
七脚怪的目的 地球 你们的目的是什么
Heptapod purpose Earth. What is your purpose?

806
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,430
只有科斯特洛了吗
Do we only have Costello?

807
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,829
很好 你来了
Okay. There you are.

808
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,793
它说了什么
What does it say?

809
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,072
提供武器
Offer weapon.

810
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,155
你看见他们写的了
You saw what they wrote!

811
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,576
他们还没搞懂那个词的意思
Using a word they don't fully understand.

812
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,192
-可能只是个要求 -是警告
- Could be a request. - A warning.

813
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,192
够了 露易丝你说
Enough! Louise?

814
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,316
我们不知道他们是否理解了
We don't know if they understand

815
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,034
武器和工具之间的区别
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

816
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,997
我们的语言和文化一样复杂
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

817
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,872
有时候 一个词可能包含很多意思
and sometimes, one can be both.

818
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,313
这是很有可能的
And it's quite possible

819
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,670
他们想要我们提供一些东西
that they're asking us to offer them something,

820
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,153
而不是提供给我们武器
not the other way around.

821
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,350
就好像第一次交易
It's like the first part of a trade.

822
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,317
所以 我们怎样搞明白
So, how do we clarify their intentions

823
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,759
他们究竟是什么意思
beyond those two words?

824
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
我会再进去一次
Well, I go back in.

825
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,837
就现在 我们进去搞清楚
Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.

826
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,558
听起来很复杂啊
It's more complicated than that.

827
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,029
这怎么就很复杂了
How is it more complicated than that?

828
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,509
上校 国防部长
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense

829
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,153
要求和你通话
is on the line for you.

830
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,791
在我们弄清楚它的意思之前
We need to sit on this information

831
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,319
这个消息需要保密
till we know what it means,

832
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,271
所以不要告诉我们的敌人
so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

833
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,759
还有一种情况是
We must consider the idea

834
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,936
我们的观光者想要我们自相残杀
that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves

835
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,394
直到一方取得胜利
until only one faction prevails.

836
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,391
-没有那样的事 -就是这样
- There's no evidence of that. - Sure there is.

837
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,869
多看看历史书吧
Just grab a history book.

838
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,595
英国人和印度人 德国人和卢旺达人
The British with India, the Germans with Rwanda.

839
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,114
他们甚至在匈牙利命名了
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

840
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,595
不只是一个人掌控着这个世界
Yeah. We're a world with no single leader.

841
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,376
他们不可能只和一个国家做交易
It's impossible to deal with just one of us.

842
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,755
而武器这个词
And with the word "Weapon" Now...

843
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,515
-哈尔彭 -在 长官
Halpern. Yes, sir!

844
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,790
暂时没有消息 待命
No confirmation yet. Standing by.

845
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,839
有消息了吗 他们说了什么
Anything? What did they say?

846
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,496
中国和俄罗斯都不在线
China and Russia are off the grid.

847
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,794
他们没和任何人说话
They aren't speaking to anyone.

848
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,509
他们在上次交谈中了解到的内容把他们吓坏了
Whatever they learned in their last session has them spooked.

849
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,599
好的 长官
Yes, sir!

850
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,472
上级要求我们离线
We have orders to do the same.

851
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,709
这些是我们的盟友
These are our allies!

852
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,955
你不能这样
You can't shut us down!

853
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,712
-关闭我们的信号 -快点
- Put us on radio silence. - Do it.

854
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,389
我们收到了来自七脚怪的消息 天啊
We received a message from the hept... Damn it!

855
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,952
我们应该保持沟通
We need to be talking to each other!

856
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,753
你想和他们说话 弄清楚这什么意思
You want to talk to them? Find out what this means.

857
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,956
基地连线已关闭
Base-camp talk is now offline.

858
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,355
所有的传译员和国际联系人
All interpreters and international liaisons,

859
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,035
暂时离开 去向协调人报告
stand down and report to unit coordinators.

860
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,559
我们之前从没有再次对话
We've never re-entered a session before.

861
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,234
露易丝 相信我 我们还有时间
Louise, trust me, okay? We've got time.

862
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,516
我们快成功了对吧
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

863
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,556
使用武器
"Use weapon."

864
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,959
来自外星人的信息
This is the alien message

865
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,310
导致中国政府今天
said to have provoked the Chinese government

866
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,078
让科学家们退出了
to withdraw their scientists from

867
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,753
国际合作任务
the international mission today.

868
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,075
尚将军在声明中说到
In a statement, General Shang said,

869
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,276
中国不再相信外星人了
"China no longer trusts the aliens

中国请求立即和联合国进行对话
China has asked for immediate talks at the UN.

873

我是秃鹰 完毕

班克斯博士 对话已经结束

我们一直试图联系马克思上校
We've been attempting to hail Captain Marks.

891
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,872

01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,032
为什么 安排保护人员
Why not? Send security.

提供武器 到底是什么意思
"Offer weapon, question mark."

01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,629
你会给我们什么吗
Are you offering us something?

Technology, apparatus, method?

896
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,470
看 这是一个不同的词
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

897
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,313

艾伯特想让我写在玻璃上
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

910
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,951
可以这么做吗
Can you even do that?

01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,957
不知道
I don't know.

912
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,671
我没法同时用两只手写出来
I can't do it with both hands.

913
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,832
露易丝
Louise...

914
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,348
怎么回事
What is that?

915
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,479
嘿 轻点

跟你一样 他没事
Same as you. He's okay.

Who, um... Who did this?

921
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,192
啊 几个士兵
Ah, some soldiers.

他们电视看多了
They've been watching too much TV.

923
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,112
什么声音
What is that?

924
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,599

大概十分钟前 韦伯把他叫走了

He wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.

929
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,873
你们整个营里的工作人员
Your whole tent is on the clock

930
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,713
都在研究你们刚刚的发现
to figure out whatever it is you were given up there.

931
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,959
这是全部吗
This is all of it?

932
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,554
录像没有被爆炸影响吗
The feed wasn't interrupted by the explosion?

933
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,036
据我所知没有
Not as far as I can see.

934
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,879
你看到了什么
You see something?

935
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,473
哦 还未可知
Oh, I don't know yet.

936
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,393
我需要和露易丝的团队一起研究
I'm gonna need my team to get together with Louise's team.

937
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,078
我需要所有工作人员一起研究
I need everybody working on this.

938
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,559
我们不能离开
We cannot leave.

939
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,079
很高兴你醒了
Glad to see you're awake.

940
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,913
我们需要回到里面 解释我们不是有意这么做的
We need to go back in and explain this wasn't our fault.

941
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,996
-我们不能再进去了 -我们必须进去
- We can't go back inside. - We have to.

942
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,389
刚刚里面发生的是一场袭击
What happened in there was an attack.

943
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,480
我们可以往好处想
We can hope for the best,

944
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,056
但是我收到命令准备反击
but I have orders to prepare for retaliation.

945
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,513
我们可能不得不撤离
We may have to evacuate.

946
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,640
不 这才是错误的举动
No, that's the wrong move.

947
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,915
只要他们不走 我们就必须留下
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

948
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,111
他们不是要走
Well, they're not leaving.

949
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,952
为什么感觉这样更糟
Why does this feel worse?

950
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,636
中国已经准备进攻
China is on the offensive.

951
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,392
他们正在部署军队
They're positioning the military

952
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,216
准备直接把外星飞船轰出大气层
to blow the alien vessel right out of the sky.

953
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,719
若果真如此
And if this happens,

954
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,456
我们就不能坐以待毙
we can't sit around waiting for retaliation.

955
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,072
所以请全部武装
So, get prepared.

956
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,314
空军步兵候命
The Air Force and infantry are standing by.

957
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,440
是 长官
Yes, sir.

958
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,629
今晚 中国将成为首个向外星人宣战
Tonight, China becomes the first world power

959
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,393
的世界强国
to declare war against the aliens.

960
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,074
在联合国
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts

961
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,673
外交努力失败后
at the United Nations,

962
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,752
中国已确定其语言专家将于今夜
China has confirmed that its language experts have tonight

963
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,513
在上海发布最后通牒
delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site.

964
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,999
在电视播送声明中
In a televised statement,

965
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,078
尚将军 人民解放军总司令
General Shang, chairman of the People's Liberation Army,

966
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,835
宣称外星人有二十四小时的时间离开中国领区
said the aliens have 24 hours to leave Chinese territory

967
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,279
否则兵戎相见
or face destruction.

968
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,510
同时尚将军主张其他国家领导人
And he urged all other world leaders

969
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,677
同中国联合 统一战线
to unite with China and take a similar stance.

970
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,195
目前飞船着陆点已集结大量武力
With a huge buildup of forces at their landing sites,

971
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,039
巴基斯坦 俄罗斯及苏丹都被认为
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan are thought to be

972
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,678
会追随中国的行动
following China's lead.

973
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,351
肯定不是随机的
It can't be random.

974
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,994
我们得花费数年的时间了
It's going to take us years.

975
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,996
这个词是什么
What's this term here?

976
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,991
妈妈
Mom...

977
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,119
妈妈
Mom...

978
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,753
嗯 亲爱的
Hmm? Sweetie...

979
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,990
呃 这说的是什么词
Uh, what's this term for that thing,

980
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,991
一个专业术语
like a... Like a technical term,

981
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,593
当我们交易的时候
where we make a deal,

982
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,671
我们双方都能获益
and we both get something out of it.

983
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,512
妥协
A compromise.

984
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,919
不是
No...

985
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,195
再比如 它是竞争
Like, it's a competition.

986
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,872
嗯哼
Mm-hmm...

987
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,558
最终双方都很高兴
But both sides end up happy.

988
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,233
就像双赢
Like a win-win.

989
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,470
更学术一点
More science-y than that.

990
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,597
如果你想要更科学的说法 打电话给你爸爸
If you want science, call your father.

991
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,279
谢谢
Thank you.

992
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,752
抱歉
Sorry.

993
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,114
没关系
It's okay.

994
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,077
我醒了
I'm up.

995
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,553
现在什么时间
What time is it?

996
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,878
现在是你该打开你一直珍藏的美酒的时候
It's time you opened that bottle you've been hiding.

997
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,234
你是不是有什么突破
You cracked something, didn't you?

998
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,548
没错 过来
Yeah. Come here.

999
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,038
看这部分
Take a look at this section.

1000
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,839
他好像在说时间
It seems to be talking about time.

1001
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,480
他们的时间符号随处可见
Their symbol for time is everywhere.

1002
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,073
所以这是什么
So what is this?

1003
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,677
一个超光速飞行公式
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

1004
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,830
谁说得准
Who can tell?

1005
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,478
他们有很多的缺口
There are too many gaps.

1006
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,073
没一个完整的
Nothing's complete.

1007
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,673
然后我才恍然大悟
Then it dawned on me.

1008
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,239
过来这边
Come here.

1009
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,038
这里
Right here.

1010
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,954
不要只关注存在什么 还要看看空缺的部分
Stop focusing on the ones. Look at the zeroes.

1011
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,951
实物数据占多少
How much of this is data?

1012
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,679
空缺部分占多少
How much of it is negative space?

1013
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,637
所以 我测算了一下
So, I measured it.

1014
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,714
0.0833 3循环
0.0833 recurring.

1015
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,114
或许你想把它化成一个分数
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

1016
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,991
十二分之一
One of twelve.

1017
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,230
他们想在这里说的是这是十二个中的一个
What they're saying right here is that this is one of 12.

1018
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,151
“我们是一个大整体中的一部分”
"We are part of a larger whole."

1019
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,435
或者我们是十二个奖品角逐者其中之一
Or we're one of 12 contestants for the prize.

1020
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,873
我为什么要跟他说话
Why do I have to talk to him?

1021
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,399
我们都在一起工作
We're all working together.

1022
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,755
我们需要和其他地点交流
We need to talk to the other sites,

1023
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,354
用他们从七脚怪那里得到的信息帮助他们
help them with what they've gotten from the heptapods.

1024
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,634
我们的通讯被中断了
We're blacked out.

1025
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,915
中国已经扬言要毁掉他们的外星飞船
China just threatened to destroy their shell.

1026
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,069
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

1027
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,976
但是这也说了所有的部分可以拼凑在一起
But this says that all of the pieces fit together.

1028
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,831
我要告诉你没人关心这些
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

1029
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,475
两小时前
Two hours ago,

1030
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,630
我们截获了一段俄罗斯秘密通讯的音频
we pulled this audio off a secure channel in Russia.

1031
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,393
他们的科研组的一位组员曾试图传播出这条讯息
Someone on the science team there was broadcasting wide.

1032
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,508
最后一次会议 外星人声称
In their final session, the aliens said,

1033
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,672
“时间紧迫 合众为一”
"There is no time. Many become one."

1034
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,274
我担心所有人都开始明火执仗
I fear we have all been given weapons.

1035
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,035
如果有人收到这条信息 请
If anyone is receiving this, please...

1036
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,599
嗯 我的意思是
Well, I mean,

1037
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,119
有很多种方式
there are a lot of ways

1038
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,593
可以解释他说的话
you can interpret what he said.

1039
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,720
我不需要一个翻译告诉我这是什么意思
I don't need an interpreter to know what this means.

1040
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,870
俄罗斯刚刚处决了其中的一个专家
Russia just executed one of their own experts

1041
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,154
以防走漏风声
to keep their secret.

1042
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,754
“合众为一”的意思可能是
"Many become one" Could just be their way of saying

1043
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,558
需要各国通力合作
"Some assembly required."

1044
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,392
那为什么只给我们每个国家一部分
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1045
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,198
为什么不直接给我们完整的
Why not just give it all over?

1046
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,510
还有什么更好的方式能让我们合作一次
What better way to force us to work together for once?

1047
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,908
就算我信你
Even if I did believe you,

1048
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,719
你要如何才能让其他国家马首是瞻
how in the world are you gonna get anybody else to play along

1049
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,711
贡献出他们的资料
and give up their data?

1050
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,075
我们也提供我们的资料
We offer ours in return.

1051
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,639
是吗
Yeah?

1052
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,119
做一笔交易
A trade?

1053
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,713
这叫非零和博弈
It's a non-zero-sum game.

1054
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,034
非零和博弈
Non-zero-sum game.

1055
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,990
就是这个 对
That's it. Yeah.

1056
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,911
谢谢
Thanks.

1057
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,119
有九个着陆地点
Nine of the landing sites have gone

1058
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,428
通讯完全中断
total comms blackout.

1059
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,520
唯一联络到他们的方式就是长途跋涉
Only way to reach them is to physically drive there

1060
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,989
对着边防战士大喊 我们正在进行这种方案
and yell at the border guards, which we're doing,

1061
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,354
但是这样太慢了
but it won't be fast enough.

1062
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,829
一定有其他方法和他们联络
There must be a way to get the message to them.

1063
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,832
我们的盟国有希望 但是这样机会渺茫而且是亡羊补牢
To our allies, maybe, but it's too little too late.

1064
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,434
我们现在要做的就是在一国触发全球战争之前
What we need is to get all the other nations online

1065
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,431
联系到所有可以通讯的国家
before one starts global war.

1066
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,476
但是我们现在无法联系到他们
And there's no way for us to reach them.

1067
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,592
好 等一下 有了
Okay, hold on a second. There is!

1068
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,159
它现在处于我们的正上方
It's right above us.

1069
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,640
对我们来说它才是当务之急
That's problematic for us right now.

1070
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,752
国防部认为这个飞船会报复我们
The Pentagon's convinced our shell will retaliate.

1071
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,957
我猜他们会命令我们一个小时内撤离
My guess is they'll order us to evacuate within the hour.

1072
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,792
听着 他们不是我们的敌人
Look, they're not our enemy.

1073
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,996
他们并没有对我们做出攻击性行为
They've made no act of aggression towards us.

1074
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,200
也许这就是他们进攻的方式
Maybe this is their way of being aggressive.

1075
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,719
这不是问题
That's not the question.

1076
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,392
那什么才是问题
What is the question?

1077
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,710
现在它已经半英里高
How do we get you back in that room

1078
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,438
我们怎么把你们送上去都成问题
when it's half a mile straight up?

1079
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,272
我觉得我们在这里的工作已经结束了
I think our work here is done.

1080
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,278
现在决定权在上级手里
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1081
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,990
她到底在干什么
What the hell is she doing?

1082
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,758
噢 我的天呐 噢 天呐 不
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!

1083
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,272
科斯特洛
Costello...

1084
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,717
艾伯特呢
Where's Abbott?

1085
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,872
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1086
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,076
我们都很抱歉
We're sorry.

1087
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,029
我想要你
I need you to...

1088
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,432
我想要你给你们中的其他人发一则信息
I need you to send a message to the other sites.

1089
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,993
我不
I don't...

1090
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,071
我不懂
I don't understand.

1091
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:18,199
你们来这里的目的是什么
What is your purpose here?

1092
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,160
你是如何知晓未来
How can you know the future?

1093
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,195
我不
I don't...

1094
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,753
我不明白 那个孩子是谁
I don't understand. Who is this child?

1095
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,598
这部戏叫做
The show is called

1096
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,188
《妈妈爸爸和动物对话》
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

1097
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,030
等一下 不要 等一下
Wait! No! Wait!

1098
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,712
-班克斯博士 -露易丝
- Dr. Banks! - Louise!

1099
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,472
你还好吗
Are you all right?

1100
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,436
-你还好吗 -没事 我没事
- You all right? - Yeah. I'm all right.

1101
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,953
发生了什么
What happened?

1102
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,349
我正在思考 信息量太大了
I'm trying to figure it out. This is too big.

1103
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,908
现在不重要了 我们接到命令立即撤退
Doesn't matter now. We have orders to evacuate.

1104
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,194
为什么
Why?

1105
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,316
俄罗斯和苏丹已经和中国统一战线
Russia and Sudan are following China.

1106
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,349
我不明白
I don't understand.

1107
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,669
帮我一下 妈妈
Help me, Mama.

1108
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,188
露易丝 哇哦
Louise? Whoa!

1109
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,475
妈妈
Mom!

1110
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,799
妈妈
Mama!

1111
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,196
抱歉 亲爱的
Sorry, honey.

1112
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,355
今天是周几 你知道吗 宝贝
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1113
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,198
星期天
Sunday.

1114
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,671
你会像爸爸那样不要我吗
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1115
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,355
哦 汉娜 亲爱的 爸爸没有不要你
Oh, Hannah, honey, your daddy didn't leave you.

1116
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,516
这个周末你就可以见到他了
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1117
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,713
他不再像以前一样看我了
He doesn't look at me the same way anymore.

1118
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,871
是我的错
It's my fault.

1119
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,031
我告诉了他一些他还没做好心理准备的话
I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.

1120
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,552
是什么
What?

1121
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,317
嗯
Well...

1122
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,709
不管你信不信
Believe it or not,

1123
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,473
我能预知未来
I know something that's going to happen.

1124
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,233
我也无法解释我怎么知道 但我就是知道
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1125
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,077
当我告诉你爸爸的时候 他真的很生气
And when I told your daddy, he got really mad.

1126
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
她说我做错了选择
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1127
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,037
是什么 未来要发生什么
What? What's going to happen?

1128
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,878
这和一种十分罕见的疾病有关
It has to do with a really rare disease.

1129
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,995
而且它不可阻挡
And it's unstoppable.

1130
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,120
就像你一样
Kind of like you are,

1131
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:55,789
像你的泳技和你写的诗
with your swimming and your poetry

1132
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,518
以及其他所有你分享给世界的
and all the other amazing things

1133
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,352
令人叹为观止的事情
that you share with the world.

1134
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,998
我所向披靡吗
I'm unstoppable?

1135
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,752
嗯
Yeah.

1136
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,631
我扶住你了
I got you.

1137
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,477
露易丝 露易丝
Louise? Louise?

1138
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,034
我现在才知道为什么我的丈夫离开我
I just realized why my husband left me.

1139
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,639
我的丈夫离开了我
My husband left me.

1140
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,279
你结婚了吗
You were married?

1141
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,874
振作起来 我们离开这里
Come on! Let's get out of here.

1142
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,673
妈妈
Mama?

1143
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,199
嗯
Yeah?

1144
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,788
为什么我叫汉娜
Why's my name Hannah?

1145
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,633
请让那些人回来
Get those people back, please.

1146
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,473
嗯 你的名字很特别
Well, your name is very special,

1147
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,710
因为它是一种回文
because it is a palindrome.

1148
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,509
顺读和倒读都一样
It reads the same forward and backward.

1149
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,149
好了 兄弟们 给我搭把手
All right, guys, give me a hand here.

1150
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,196
-是 长官 -那个放进包里
- Yes, sir. - That goes in the bag.

1151
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,198
准备出发
Ready to go!

1152
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,752
撤退准备就绪
Evacuation underway.

1153
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,194
嘿
Hey...

1154
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:12,319
我们在这里的任务结束了 这个要带走
We're done here! We're taking this with us.

1155
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,917
我能看懂
I can read it.

1156
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,637
-我知道这是什么 -什么
- I know what it is. - What?

1157
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,274
这不是指武器 是说馈赠
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

1158
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,271
武器是他们的语言
The weapon is their language.

1159
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,590
他们把它送给了我们 你知道这意味着什么吗
They gave it to us. Do you know what that means?

1160
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,752
意味着我们可以学习七脚怪的语言 如果我们活下来的话
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.

1161
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,479
如果你学会了 当你真正学会的时候
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1162
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,949
你就能够理解他们理解时间的方式
you begin to perceive time the way that they do,

1163
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,077
所以你能看到即将发生的事
so you can see what's to come.

1164
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,151
但是时间 于他们而言跟我们不同
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1165
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,510
时间是非线性的
It's non-linear.

1166
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,154
听着 我们已经尽力了 但是还尚不足以
Look, we did our best, but it wasn't enough.

1167
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,833
上尉会接你们上去
The captain will load you up.

1168
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,552
你们会在五分钟后起飞
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.

1169
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:18,758
伊恩 露易丝 很荣幸能与你们共事
Ian, Louise, it was an honor to work with you.

1170
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,876
祝你好运
Good luck.

1171
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,311
嘿 上校
Hey, Colonel...

1172
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,195
我去问一下我们去哪
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

1173
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,836
醒醒 妈妈
Wake up, Mommy!

1174
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,078
班克斯博士
Dr. Banks...

1175
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,952
很高兴见到你
A pleasure.

1176
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,715
尚将军 应该是我与有荣焉
General Shang, the pleasure is mine, really.

1177
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,836
贵国总统说
Your president said

1178
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,117
很荣幸能在此次庆祝会上款待我
he was honored to host me at the celebration...

1179
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,872
的确如此
Yeah.

1180
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,992
但是我得坦白 我来此的唯一原因
...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here

1181
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,709
就是亲自会见你
is to meet you in person.

1182
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,192
我吗 真是不胜荣幸 谢谢
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

1183
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:50,075
十八个月前
18 months ago,

1184
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,714
你做了一件非比寻常的大事
you did something remarkable,

1185
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,873
一件即便是我的上级也做不到的事
something not even my superior has done.

1186
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,878
那是什么事
And what's that?

1187
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,638
你改变了我的想法
You changed my mind.

1188
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,952
你才是此次联合的根源
You're the reason for this unification,

1189
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:12,439
都是因为你联系到了我的私人电话
all because you reached out to me at my private number.

1190
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,635
您的私人号码
Your private number?

1191
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,069
尚将军 我 我不知道您的私人号码
General, I... I don't know your private number.

1192
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,072
现在你知道了
Now you know.

1193
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,757
我不强求知道你的大脑如何运作
I do not claim to know how your mind works,

1194
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,596
但是我相信对你来说知道号码一定很重要
but I believe it was important for you to see that.

1195
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,118
我给你打了电话 是吗
I called you, didn't I?

1196
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,635
是的 你给我打了电话
Yes, you did.

01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,072

好了可以关闭系统了
All right, let's shut down the system.

1199
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,835
长官这里有一个通讯线路正在拨号中国
Sir? There's a sat line here dialing China.

1200
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,676
这里 你说“这里”是什么意思
Here? What do you mean "Here"?

1201
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,070

我永远都不会忘记你说的话
I will never forget what you said.

01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:24,309
你跟我说了我妻子的临终遗言
