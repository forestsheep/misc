-我們還需要一會兒 保羅 -好的 神父
- We'll just be another moment, Paul. - Of course, father.

55
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:27,001
希拉 現在我以個人名義保證

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,167
額 我盡可能準確地描述
uh, well, to put it as eloquently as I can,

59
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,982

60

但羅比和斯圖爾特的

交情比你們大多數人活得還要久
Stewart longer than most of you have been alive,

62
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,422
所以接下來就讓他來說說吧
so I'll hand it off to him.

63
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:24,492
-羅比 -噢 謝謝 本
- Robby. - Oh, well, thanks, Ben.

64
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,060
其實不想謝你
I think.

65
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:31,031
儘管對你所說的我的資歷輩分 我並不盡認同
Although I take issue with your reference to my seniority,

66
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:35,269
但不可否認 斯圖爾特的離開對我來說特別痛苦
I will say that Stewart's departure is especially painful for me.

67
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,005
因為 斯圖爾特

有二十年了吧
Twenty years now?

69
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:40,843
斯圖爾特一直
Stewart's been more than

勤勤懇懇地把錢輸在撲克桌上
willing to part with his money at the poker table.

71

而我還有個大學生要養

那就祝你一切順利了
Godspeed then.

74
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,857
斯圖爾特 我覺得
Now, Stewart, I find the timing

75
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,827
你離開的時間特別煩人
of your departure disconcerting.

76
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,464
角落的辦公室空了
The corner office sits empty.

- Did you see the numbers from Washington? - Yeah. Very interesting.

85
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,328
我也覺得
I think so too.

86
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,838
我不是在問你警察局是不是在撒謊 我知道他們在撒謊
I'm not asking if the pd's lying. I know they're lying.

87
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,268
我要問的就是 這背後是誰在指使
All I'm asking-- who's behind it?

我講了那麼久 還沒吃午飯呢
I've been talking so long I didn't eat lunch.

91
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:54,808
所以我要去找點吃的了
So I'm going to get something to eat.

92
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,068
正好給你一小時決定
That'll give you an hour to decide

93
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,848
你到底要不要在站在正確的一方
whether you want to be on the right side of this

94
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,748
還是想像其他人一樣讀著我們的報道
or read about it like everybody else.

95
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,588
-再見 丹 -你覺得卡希爾手上有料嗎
- Bye, Dan. - You think Cahill has something?

96
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:04,788
可能吧 我只是覺得我們不該做這個故事
Maybe. I just don't think the story's for us.

97
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,858
-本喜歡 -是啊 它還行

98
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,188
-隻是不符合聚焦的風格 -什麼不符合
- It's just not spotlight. - What's just not spotlight?

99
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,798
-警察局的數據 -那個數據的報道 感覺很站不住腳
- The pd numbers. - The numbers story. It feels thin.

100
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:14,168
噢 你讓卡希爾開口了嗎
Oh. You got Cahill to talk?

101
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,698
還沒 但我會的
No. But I will.

102
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:20,068
很好 到時我們就知道站不站得住腳了
Good. Then we'll know if it's thin.

103
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,538
-樓上情況怎麼樣 -還不錯

-要去《紐約時報》工作 -不是吧 真的嗎
- are going to the Times. - Come on. Really?

107
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,178
他們在吸我們的血
They're leeching us.

108
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,818
他們從邁阿密派了個人過來 情況應該會好點
They're sending a guy from Miami to run things. That should help.

109
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,488
巴倫之前在波士頓待過嗎
Has Baron even spent time in Boston?

110
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:39,058
我想他之前從沒來過這裏 我們應該給他買張地圖
I don't think he's been here before. We should buy him a map.

111
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:42,058
-我在邁阿密的一個朋友說他裁了百分之十五的員工 -真棒
- A friend down in Miami said he cut 15% of the staff. - Great.

Hey, Robby. New boss coming in to make some cuts?

00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,368
-你不是要和他坐下來談嗎 -是的

116
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,248
但我知道本想要
But I do know that Ben

117
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:56,208
那個犯罪數據的報道
needs an answer on the crime numbers story.

118
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,708
我和你說 我真的覺得我們不該做這個故事
I'm telling you, I really don't think that story's for us.

119
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,818
-巴倫先生 -噢
- Mr. Baron. - Oh.

120

Ah, yeah. It's a great book.

125
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:21,868
對了 你安頓下來後
The globe has season tickets

126
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:24,168
《環球報》會有芬威球場的季票

127
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:28,608

Thank you. To be honest, I'm-- I'm not much of a baseball fan.

128

00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,678
是的 土生土長
I am. Born and raised, yeah.

132
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,948
新聞編輯部裏很多人都是
A lot of the newsroom is from here.

133
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:43,248
感覺就好像是 一家本地報社
It really feels like a-- like a local paper in that way.

134
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,858
報紙被《紐約時報》收購後有改變這個感覺嗎
And did that change at all after the paper was sold to the times?

135
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:51,398
沒有 沒 我覺得還不至於有這麼大影響
No. No, I don't think that had a big impact.

I'd prefer to think of myself as player coach, but yes.

139
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,808
你熟悉聚焦嗎
Are you familiar with spotlight?

140
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,408
不是很瞭解
No, not particularly.

141

00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,878
我們工作保持絕對機密
and we keep our work confidential.

144
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,148
你們現在在跟進什麼
What are you working on now?

145
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,488
我們剛完結一個假冒建築公司的報道
We just put out a piece on a shoddy construction outfit,

146
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,268
現在我們只是在
and right now we're really

147
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,998
尋找有沒有值得挖掘的故事
just trolling around for our next story.

148
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:27,498
這一般需要多長時間
How long does that typically take?

149
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,868
很難說 額 幾個月吧
Hard to say. Uh, a couple months.

150
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,498
-幾個月 -是的
- Couple months? - Yeah.

151
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,408
我們不想操之過急
We don't like to rush it.

152
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,508
我們一旦選定一個項目
Once we settle on a project,

153
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,878
我們會花上一年甚至更多的時間去調查
we can spend a year or more investigating it.

154
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,118
-有什麼問題嗎 -不一定
- Is that a concern? - Not necessarily.

155
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,518
嗯 但從我所瞭解的看來 閱讀量正在下降
Um, but from what I understand, readership is down.

156
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:51,458
互聯網侵入了各行各業 還有 額
Internet is cutting into the classified business and, uh,

157
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,758
我想我需要對這些事情嚴肅對待
I think I'm gonna need to take a hard look at things.

158
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,798
所以 你希望精簡人員
So, you anticipate more cuts.

159
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:02,668
額 可以這麼說
Uh, I think it's safe to assume so.

160
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:07,438
但是 額 我現在更關注的是 要如何讓讀者
But, uh, what I'm more focused on right now is finding a way to--

161
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:11,178
覺得這份報紙不可或缺
to make this paper essential to its readers.

162
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,378
我覺得它已經做到了
I like to think it already is.

163
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,778
好吧 我只是認為我們可以做得更好
Fair enough. I just think that we can do better.

164
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,228
-布萊德利先生 -嘿
- Mr. Bradlee. - Hey.

165
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,068
看到警察局的數據了 看起來很有趣
Saw the pd numbers. Looks interesting.

166
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,868
是啊 裏面有點故事
Yeah, there's something there.

167
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,898
-你還需要多長時間 -額 再多一周
- How long do you need? - Uh, another week.

168
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:42,408
-你要去哪 -去開會啊
- Where are you going? - To the 10:30.

169
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,908
你什麼時候也要開會了
Since when?

170
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:46,308
嚴格來說 我是個編輯
Well, technically, I am an editor.

171
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:50,008
嚴格來說而已 你和巴倫聊的怎麼樣
Technically. Your sit-down with baron go that well?

172
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,018
-我讀不懂他這個人 -居然有你讀不懂的人
- I couldn't get a read on him. - That's a first.

173
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,518
-那你呢 -他是個開心果啊
- How about you? - Well, he's a barrel of laughs.

174
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,258
-大家早上好 -那我們開始吧
- Morning, everyone. - Let's get started.

175
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,658
你想說幾句嗎 馬蒂
Do you want to say something, Marty?

176
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,198
額 好的
Uh, sure.

177
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:06,998
額 大家好
Uh, hello.

178
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:09,898
額 大家應該都知道
Uh, as most of you know by now,

179
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,268
我叫馬蒂·巴倫
my name is Marty baron.

180
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,668
我 很開心來到這裏
I'm, uh, delighted to be here.

181
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:17,448
我們輪著說話的時候
Um, if you could tell me

182
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:20,778
如果你們能順便說一下自己的名字就更好了
your name as we go around, that'd be helpful.

183
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,408
謝謝
Thank you.

184
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,778
好的 彼得
Okay. Peter?

185
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,948
彼得·卡內洛斯 來自《都市報》
Peter canellos, Metro.

186
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:30,248
我有個大故事要挖完了
I've got a major big dig closure.

187
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,188
-嘿 史蒂夫 -麥克
- Hey, Steve. - Mike.

188
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:37,288
嘿 昨晚的比賽很爛吧
Hey. Crappy game last night, huh?

189
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:39,358
是啊 他們的擊球爛到爆了
Yeah, they can't hit worth a nickel.

190
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:40,458
嘿 聽著 那個
Hey, listen, what's,

191
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,028
艾琳·麥克納馬拉在會議室裏做什麼
um-- what's Eileen McNamara doing in the 10:30?

192
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,538
-你需要點什麼嗎 麥克 -不 我只是好奇
- Do you need something, Mike? - No, just curious.

193
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,808
去別的地方好奇去 我還有事要做呢
Go be curious somewhere else. I got work to do.

194
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,438
-好吧 史蒂夫 再見了 -不送
- Okay, Steve. See ya. - Yeah.

195
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:54,648
看來佩德羅要到九月一號才會重回賽場
And it looks like Pedro's gonna be out till September 1.

196
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,128
吉米說他今年就會重新開始比賽
Jimmy says he'll be back this year,

197
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,478
但醫生看起來沒那麼肯定
but the doc didn't seem so sure.

198
00:09:57,478 --> 00:10:00,018
新英格蘭愛國者隊的開幕賽是什麼時候
When's the Pats opener?

199
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,318
大家都說過了嗎
Is that, uh, everyone?

200
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,728
-是的 -好的 謝謝
- Yes, that's it. - Okay. Good. Thank you.

201
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:13,928
大家讀過艾琳·麥克納馬拉這周的專欄了嗎
Uh, did everyone read Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?

202
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,798
是那個吉歐根的案子嗎
That's the geoghan case?

203
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,838
是的 後續報道如何
Yeah. What's the folo on that?

204
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:22,608
那就是個專欄 你想要怎麼樣的後續報道
It-- it's a column. What kind of folo were you thinking?

205
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,608
額 很顯然 三十年來 這位神父
Uh, well, apparently this priest molested kids

206
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,948
在六個不同教區都猥褻過兒童
in six different parishes over the last 30 years,

207
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:30,108
而受害者的律師 額
and the attorney for the victims, Mr., uh--

208
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:32,648
-加拉貝迪安先生 -謝謝 艾琳
- Garabedian. - Thanks, Eileen.

209
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,228
加拉貝迪安先生說勞紅衣主教
Mr. Garabedian says cardinal Law

210
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,588
十五年前就發現了他的行徑 卻無所作為
found out about it 15 years ago and did nothing.

211
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:38,168
我覺得那個律師是個怪人
I think that attorney's a bit of a crank.

212
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,518
教會也否認了這一說法
And the church dismissed the claim.

213
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,988
公說公有理 婆說婆有理
He said, she said.

214
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,358
不管加拉貝迪安先生是不是怪人
Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or not,

215
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,698
他說他有文件可以證明主教知道此事
he says he has documents that prove the cardinal knew.

216
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,328
據我所知 這些文件是密封的
As I understand it, those documents are under seal.

217
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,268
好吧 但事實就是事實 波士頓一位神父虐待八十位兒童
Okay, but the fact remains, a Boston priest abused 80 kids,

218
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,968
我們有一位律師聲稱可以證明勞知道此事
we have a lawyer who says he can prove Law knew about it,

219
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,338
而我們過去六個月裏也就寫了 兩篇報道
and we've written all of, uh, two stories in the last six months.

220
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,708
我認為這個故事對於一個本地報紙來說十分重要
This strikes me as an essential story to a local paper.

221
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:06,318
我想我們至少要瀏覽一遍那些文件
I think at the very least we have to go through those documents.

222
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,188
你想怎麼做呢
How would you like to do that?

223
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,888
額 我不清楚這裏的法律
Well, uh, I don't know what the laws are here,

224
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,288
但在佛羅里達 我們會上法庭
but in Florida, we would go to court.

225
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,088
你想要控告教會嗎
You want to sue the church?

226
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:18,728
嚴格來說 我們不會控告教會
Technically, we wouldn't sue the church.

227
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,568
我們只是提出動議 要求公開密封文件
We'd file a motion to lift the seal on those documents.

228
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,998
教會會理解為我們要控告他們
The church will read that as us suing them.

229
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:26,038
大家都會這麼認為
So will everybody else.

230
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,538
謝謝告知
Good to know.

231
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,208
-新官上任三把火啊 -這說得真沒錯
- Gutsy call for the first day. - That's one word for it.

232
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,078
你覺得這會有什麼後果
How do you think that's gonna play down front?

233
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,478
我想吉爾曼會很擔心
I think Gilman's gonna shit a brick.

234
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:39,978
-嘿 -關門
- Hey. - Door.

235
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,648
怎麼樣
How'd it go?

236
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:45,558
巴倫想要提出動議 公開吉歐根一案的密封文件
Well, Baron wants to sue for the sealed docs in the Geoghan case.

237
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,528
他想要控告教會嗎 嘿 那很好啊
He wants to sue the church? Hey, that's great. Yeah.

238
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:51,558
三年前事發之時 我們報道過吉歐根
We covered Geoghan when the story broke three years ago.

239
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,258
那時巴倫還在邁阿密
Baron was still in Miami.

240
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,428
-其實那時他可能在《時報》 -反正他不在這裏
- He might have been at the times then, actually. - He wasn't here.

241
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:59,338
所以你覺得這有希望嗎
So do you think that suit has a chance?

242
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:02,338
-要看法官了 -以及他屬於哪個教區
- Depends on the judge. - And what parish he belongs to.

243
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,748
布萊德利 嗯
Bradlee. Yeah.

244
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,148
好的
Okay.

245
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:14,078
-巴倫想和我們談談 -我們嗎
- Baron wants to talk to us. - Us?

246
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,788
-好的 喬 -謝謝
- Okay, Joe. - Thank you.

247
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:19,188
好的 謝謝
Yes. Okay, thanks.

248
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:23,958
我已經定了明天要和外部法律顧問見面
I've set up a meeting for tomorrow with outside counsel.

249
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,858
-喬·阿爾巴諾嗎 -是的
- Joe albano? - Yeah.

250
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,768
這個案子的法官是誰
Who's the judge in this case?

251
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,928
額
Um...

252
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,768
康斯坦絲·斯威尼
Constance Sweeney.

253
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:33,368
-難搞的人 -為什麼
- Tough. - Why's that?

254
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:36,668
天主教乖乖女
Good catholic girl. Huh.

255
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,878
所以 從我所讀到的來說
So, um, judging from what I've read,

256
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,498
看來我們並沒有
it doesn't seem like we've done a

257
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,948
十分徹底地調查過吉歐根的案子
very thorough investigation into the Geoghan case.

258
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,378
-是嗎 -並不是
- Is that right? - No, it's not.

259
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:49,318
我們很認真地調查過這案子
We looked hard at geoghan.

260
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,488
《都市報》的大衛·阿姆斯特朗 還有宗教記者邁克爾·保爾森
David Armstrong from Metro, Michael Paulson for religion.

261
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,488
好吧 但我瞭解到
Okay, but, uh, just so I understand,

262
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,958
除了我們的日常報道
beyond our daily coverage, we haven't--

263
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,998
我們還沒有對勞主教是否知情一事
we haven't committed any long-term investigative resources

264
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:03,728
展開過任何長期調查
to the question of whether or not cardinal Law knew about this.

265
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,598
是的 沒有
No, we haven't.

266
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,838
而這正是你們小組幹的事對嗎
And that's the kind of thing your team would do?

267
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,608
聚焦嗎 嗯 是啊
Spotlight? Well, yeah.

268
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:14,378
但我們還在調查我和你提過的那個波士頓警局的故事
But we're still prospecting the Boston pd story I told you about.

269
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:18,248
-你們可以先把那個放一放嗎 -可以
- Could you set that aside? - We could.

270
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,948
馬蒂 過去聚焦小組總能成功
Marty, in past spotlight's had success in large part

271
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,588
是因為他們自己挑選想調查的項目
because they pick their own projects.

272
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:29,758
那你們會考慮挑選這個嗎
Would you consider picking this one?

273
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,908
我不知道他是不是在寫你的事
I don't know if he's writing about you,

274
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,828
但我會告訴他你打過電話
but I will let him know you called.

275
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,298
-好的 拜拜 -嘿
- Okay. Bye. - Hey.

276
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,138
-嘿 怎麼樣了 -還行吧
- Hey, how'd it go? - Okay.

277
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:43,108
額 巴倫想我們去弄清楚吉歐根的案子
Uh, Baron wants us to scrub the Geoghan case.

278
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,708
-那很好啊 -我們不是報道過吉歐根嗎
- That's great. - Didn't we cover geoghan?

279
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,148
是啊 有個律師聲稱勞主教知情
Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging cardinal law knew about it.

280
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:50,808
-嗯 米奇·加拉貝迪安 是嗎 -是的
- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right? - Yeah.

281
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,378
-我在法院那報道過他 -你能聯繫到他嗎
- I covered him at the courthouse. - Can you get to him?

282
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,848
我只採訪過他一次 他還有點個性
I only interviewed him once. He's kind of a character.

283
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,488
-我就喜歡有個性的人 我來搞定他 -很好 你負責
- I like characters. I'll take him. - Good. You take him.

284
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,108
還有 我們要找波特一案中的
Also, we should be talking to the

285
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:02,528
受害者代表律師談談
lawyer who repped the victims in the Porter case.

286
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,058
-埃裏克·麥克利什 -那傢伙總上電視
- Eric Macleish. - That guy was always on TV.

287
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:08,128
-波特一案 和我說說 -嗯 額
- The Porter case? Remind me. Yeah, uh--

288
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:09,398
神父波特 相似的故事
father Porter, similar story.

289
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,898
十年前在福爾裏弗猥褻了許多兒童
Molested dozens of kids in Fall River about 10 years ago.

290
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,568
-所以我們要放棄波士頓警局的故事嗎 -我贊成
- So we're dropping the Boston pd? - I-I vote yes.

291
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,738
不 我們只是暫時將它放一邊
No. We just gotta set it aside for now.

292
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,788
不需要我和你們強調了
I don't need to tell you guys this.

293
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,078
我們這次要比平常更加謹慎
We need to be more discreet than usual.

294
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,978
所有人都會對這件事很感興趣 不僅僅是《先驅報》
Everybody's going to be interested in this, not just the Herald.

295
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,468
在我們掌握有用的信息之前
We can't let cardinal Law

296
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:28,018
不能讓勞主教知道半點風聲
get wind of this till we know what we have.

297
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,618
祝我們好運吧
Good luck with that.

298
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,728
你什麼時候走 奶奶
So when do you leave, Nana?

299
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,858
巴士九點會在教會的停車場接我們
The bus is picking us up in the church parking lot at 9:00.

300
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,398
我們有四十個人要去
We have 40 people going.

301
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,938
-多米尼克神父也去嗎 -不 他說他運氣不好
- And is father Dominic going? - No. He says he's unlucky.

302
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,838
但這和運氣沒什麼關係
But luck has nothing to do with it.

303
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,638
-你知道嗎 上次奶奶贏了一百六十刀 -哇噢
- You know, last time Nana won $160. - Wow.

304
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,548
你要告訴她嗎
You gonna tell her?

305
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:56,578
我們還不知道這其中到底有沒有料
We don't even know if there's a story yet.

306
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,678
《環球報》控告教會 這本身就是個猛料
Globe sues church? It's gonna be a story.

307
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,908
嘿 麗莎 能把所有相關的剪報都找給我嗎
Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the relevant clips on that for me?

308
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,438
好的
Yeah.

309
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,278
是給聚焦的嗎
Is this for spotlight?

310
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,378
準備好了就拿過來吧 謝了
Just drop them off when they're ready. Thanks.

311
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,448
不好意思 你知道出版商的辦公室在哪嗎
Excuse me. Do you know where the publisher's office is?

312
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:34,988
好的
Will do.

313
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,818
你好啊 馬蒂
How are you, Marty?

314
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,328
還適應嗎
Settling in?

315
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,988
嗯 還行
Yeah, I think so.

316
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,828
很好 有什麼能為你效勞嗎
Good. What can I do for you?

317
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,998
嗯
Um...

318
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:51,568
我想對吉歐根一案的保護令提出反對
I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.

319
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,668
你想控告天主教會嗎
You want to sue the catholic church?

320
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,338
額
Um--

321
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:59,308
我們現在只是提出動議 不過 是的
we're just filing a motion, but, uh, yes.

322
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,578
你覺得真的有這個必要嗎
You think it's that important?

323
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,508
是的
Yes, I do.

324
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:07,818
因為教會肯定會十分激烈地反擊我們
Because obviously the church will fight us very hard on this.

325
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,588
我們的訂閱者也會注意到
Which won't go unnoticed by our subscriber base.

326
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,588
其中百分之五十三都是天主教徒
53% of them are catholic.

327
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,988
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

328
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,028
我想他們會感興趣的
I think they'll be interested.

329
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,728
好吧
Okay.

330
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,258
馬蒂 教會的人可能會
Marty, lake street will probably

331
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:30,368
聯繫你與主教進行面談
contact you about a face-to-face with the cardinal.

332
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,538
-這是慣例 -嗯
- It's customary. - Yeah.

333
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:35,578
他們已經找我了 定在下周
They already have. It's set up for next week.

334
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,348
要是我 我就不會提起這件事
I wouldn't mention this.

335
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,958
有人嗎
Hello?

336
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,368
有人嗎
Hello?

337
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,398
-有什麼能幫你的嗎 -噢 嗨 我是《波士頓環球報》的麥克·雷贊德斯
- Can I help you? - Oh, hi. I'm Mike Rezendes from the Boston Globe.

338
00:16:58,398 --> 00:16:59,868
我是來見米切爾·加拉貝迪安的
I'm here to see Mitchell Garabedian.

339
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,738
他正在講電話 先請坐吧
He's on a call. Please have a seat.

340
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,368
好的
Okay.

341
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,048
好了 我在聽 繼續吧
All right, I'm listening. Go ahead.

342
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,018
好
Okay.

343
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,248
比爾 那些文件死哪去了
Bill! Where the hell are those papers?

344
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,388
我叫你放我桌子上的
I asked you to put 'em on my desk!

345
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:35,568
大名鼎鼎的沃爾特·羅賓森蒞臨我的會議室
The famous Walter Robinson in my conference room.

346
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,108
很高興再會 埃裏克 薩夏·法伊弗 埃裏克·麥克利什
Good to see you again, Eric. Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric macleish.

347
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:41,408
-很高興認識你 -很高興認識你 你不打高爾夫吧
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You don't play golf, do you?

348
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,278
-額 不打 -很好
- Uh, no. - Good.

349
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,258
你這位同事去年
Your colleague here took

350
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,178
在一個慈善活動上敲了我一把
some money off me at a charity event last year.

351
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:47,388
那一桿真是走運
It was a very lucky putt.

352
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,418
順便說一句 其實那時我還是閉著眼的
I actually had my eyes closed, by the way.

353
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,088
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

354
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:53,288
所以有什麼可以幫你們的嗎
So how can I help you guys?

355
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,428
額 你瞭解吉歐根那個案子嗎
Uh, you're familiar with the geoghan case?

356
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,528
當然 八十個原告
Sure. Eighty plaintiffs.

357
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,598
都是獨立的個案
All of them individual cases.

358
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,468
加拉貝迪安都要忙暈了吧
Garabedian must be swimming.

359
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:06,298
是啊 所有指控都指向勞主教嗎
Yeah. And the allegations against cardinal Law?

360
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:09,368
是啊 挺棘手的
Yeah, it's tricky. Um--

361
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:12,638
你們要清楚這一點 這些案子都很麻煩
this is what you need to understand. These are shitty cases.

362
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:15,878
嗯 訴訟時效只有三年
Um, the statute of limitations is only three years,

363
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,048
而大部分受害者
and most of these victims

364
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,918
都要很多年後才來尋求法律的幫助
don't come forward till long after that.

365
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:22,318
-噢 為什麼 -你知道的 他們都是孩子
- Oh. Why is that? - Well, they're kids, you know.

366
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,048
愧疚感 羞恥感
Uh, guilt, shame.

367
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,988
大部分孩子都來自家教嚴厲的社區
And most of these kids come from tough neighborhoods.

368
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,158
沒人想要承認這種事的發生
Nobody wants to admit this kind of thing.

369
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:31,498
所以在訴訟時效上就已經沒轍了
So you're screwed on the time limit.

370
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:35,128
而且 額 就算給你說通了這一點
And, uh, even if you argue your way around that,

371
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:38,568
慈善豁免法令的賠償金就兩萬美元
the charitable immunity statute caps damages at 20 grand.

372
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,038
猥褻一個兒童才賠償兩萬美元
Twenty grand for molesting a child?

373
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:46,008
是的 這個系統就是這麼運轉的
That is the way the system is set up, yes.

374
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,678
教會不好對付
The church is tough.

375
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:52,178
所以最好的方法就是讓媒體報道這些案子
So your best shot is to try these cases in the press,

376
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,248
就好像在波特一案中我所做的那樣
uh, like I did on Porter.

377
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:56,518
-嗯 -但大多數受害者
- Mmm. - But you know, most of the victims,

378
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,588
他們都不想和電視媒體扯上關係
they don't want to have anything to do with TV.

379
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:03,528
還有就是 米奇不算是個好相處的人
And, uh, Mitch isn't exactly a people person.

380
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:04,868
嗯 而且如果加拉貝迪安
Yeah. And if garabedian

381
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,498
沒法說服他的受害者接受媒體的報道
can't get his victims to go before the press,

382
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,268
-那他就真的 -沒錯
- then he's really-- - Yeah, that's right.

383
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:12,038
他接下來的路很漫長啊
He has a long road ahead of him.

384
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,868
我的猜測是他並沒有抓到勞的把柄
My guess is he doesn't have anything on Law.

385
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,708
什麼 你覺得他只是在嚇唬他還是
What? You think he's bluffing or--

386
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,708
我覺得他是故意吹噓來達成更好的交易
I think he's grandstanding to cut a better deal.

387
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:26,218
看起來有點魯莽啊
Seems a bit reckless.

388
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:28,888
你們見過米奇·加拉貝迪安嗎
Have you met Mitch Garabedian?

389
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:31,218
我叫你起草那個動議 比爾
I asked you to write up that motion, Bill.

390
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:33,188
我沒叫你提交
I didn't ask you to file it!

391
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,458
他嗎
Mmm?

392
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,768
嘿 比爾
Hey, bill.

393
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,248
嗨
Hi.

394
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,648
-你是誰 -我是《波士頓環球報》的麥克·雷贊德斯
- Who are you? - I'm Mike rezendes from the Boston globe.

395
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,488
我預約了和你一小時前見面的
I had an appointment with you about an hour ago.

396
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,348
我沒法和你談 我很忙 莎倫
I can't talk to you. I'm very busy. Sharon?

397
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,518
她出去買咖啡了 她說她很快回來
She went out for coffee. She said she'd be right back.

398
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,028
我在追蹤採訪一篇文章
I'm following up on an article.

399
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:11,428
-《鳳凰報》那篇嗎 -不是 《環球報》那篇
- The one in the Phoenix? - No. In the globe.

400
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,998
-你讀了《鳳凰報》那篇嗎 -還沒有
- Did you see the one in the Phoenix? - No, I didn't.

401
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,328
我覺得寫得很好 我這好像有一份
I thought it was very good. I have a copy here somewhere.

402
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,368
沒事 我晚點再看
That's all right. I'll track it down.

403
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,898
其實我是在追蹤採訪
I'm actually following up on a

404
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,438
艾琳·麥克納馬拉專欄裏報道的關於你那一個訴訟的
column that Eileen McNamara wrote about your suit.

405
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,208
不是一個 有八十四個
Suits. There are 84 of them.

406
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,778
那不是一起集體訴訟 你要補補背景知識
It's not a class action. You should get your facts straight.

407
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,778
你說得對 我應該瞭解清楚
No, you're right. I should.

408
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,748
我現在只是想問一些背景信息
So I'm trying to get some background information on--

409
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,618
你沒在錄音吧
you're not recording this, are you?

410
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,948
沒有 我不會不經允許就錄音的
Uh, no. I wouldn't do that without asking.

411
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,098
我不能給你看教會的文件
I can't show you the church documents,

412
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,948
如果你想要的是這個的話
if that's what you're after.

413
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,518
-它們是密封的 -嗯 我知道
-They're under seal. -Yeah, I know that.

414
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,458
你知道他們三次試圖
Did you know they tried to bring me up

415
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,798
在馬塞諸塞州律師監督委員會那告發我嗎
before the Massachusetts board of bar overseers three times?

416
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,258
-他們盯我盯得很緊 -教會嗎
- They're watching me very closely. - The church?

417
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,098
是的 教會
Yeah. The church. Yeah.

418
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:50,858
他們想要取消我的律師資格
They'd like to get me disbarred.

419
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,898
事實上 拿開 把那拿開
In fact-- put that away. Put it away.

420
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,868
-沒問題 -我不想你記錄這段對話
- Sure. - I don't want you recording this

421
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,538
無論什麼形式都不行
in any way, shape or form.

422
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,208
筆錄 錄音 都不行
Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.

423
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,938
事實上 我可能甚至都不應該和你說話 所以
In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you, so--

424
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:05,378
聽著 加拉貝迪安先生 我知道你有東西不能告訴我
look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's things you cannot tell me.

425
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,088
但我也知道這當中有個故事
But I also know there's a story here,

426
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,748
而我覺得這是個很重要的故事
and I think it's an important story.

427
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,648
我已經和《鳳凰報》談過了
I already talked to the Phoenix.

428
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:12,788
我知道 我沒讀那篇文章也是有原因的
Yeah, and there's a reason I didn't see it.

429
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,418
現在沒人看《鳳凰報》了
Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.

430
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,158
它們破產了 它們沒什麼力量了
They're broke. They don't have any power.

431
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,328
但《環球報》有
The globe does.

432
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:21,128
如果我們報道這個故事 所有人都會知道
If we cover this story, everybody will hear about it.

433
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,268
教會的力量積攢了無數個世紀 雷贊德斯先生
The church thinks in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.

434
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:28,338
你覺得你們報紙有這個資源來擔當起這件事嗎
Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?

435
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,468
是的 我相信
Yeah, I do.

436
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:34,138
只要你不介意我問你問題
But if you don't mind me asking, do you?

437
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:37,278
我現在沒空和你聊天 雷贊德斯先生
I can't talk to you right now, Mr. Rezendes.

438
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:39,078
我真的非常 非常忙
I'm very, very busy.

439
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,018
-莎倫 -謝謝你
- Sharon? - Thank you.

440
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:46,658
能至少讓我和你的一些客戶談一談嗎 那些受害者
Yep. Can I at least talk to some of your clients? The victims?

441
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:49,028
我真的想這麼做
I'd really like to do that.

442
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,658
-明天再給我打電話吧 我要考慮一下 -好的 謝謝你 十分感謝
- Call me tomorrow. I gotta think about it. - Yep. Thank you. Thanks.

443
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:47,718
-我找到更多剪報了 -放那吧
- I got more clips from the library. - Leave 'em right there.

444
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:50,748
你們在做關於教會的報道嗎
Are you guys doing a story on the church?

445
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:53,818
不 我們沒在做關於教會的報道
No, we are not doing a story on the church.

446
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,088
馬特 你有找到這個人的資料嗎 菲爾·薩維亞諾
Matt, you find anything on this guy, Phil Saviano?

447
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,928
沒有 他是誰
No. Who is he?

448
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:59,998
他是受害者組織中的成員
He's part of a victims' organization.

449
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:02,998
波特一案後柯吉恩做過他的報道
Kurkjian did a story on him right after the Porter case.

450
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,738
-還有個受害者組織 -是啊
- There's a victims' organization? - Yeah.

451
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:06,978
叫作斯納普 這是
It's called snap. It's, uh,

452
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:09,038
遭神父虐待之苦的受害者群體的縮寫
survivors network of those abused by priests.

453
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,138
-真可憐的名字 -嗯
- Crummy acronym. - Mmm.

454
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,278
-要我查查他嗎 -嗯 好的
- You want me to track him down? - Yeah. Bring him in.

455
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,918
你還需要多長時間看完這些剪報
How much longer you need to get through the clips?

456
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,948
好幾天吧 有好多
I mean, a few days. There's a lot.

457
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:22,888
-麗莎還在源源不斷地送過來 -行
- Lisa's still sending up more. - Okay.

458
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,788
嘿 大伙 我好像又找到一位神父了
Hey, guys. I think I got another priest.

459
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,888
利亞姆·巴雷特
Liam Barrett.

460
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,888
在費城猥褻過一些孩子
Molested some kids in Philly

461
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,858
後來搬到了波士頓
and was moved to Boston.

462
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,058
故技重施 然後又搬走了
Did the same thing and was moved again.

463
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,098
真的嗎 聽起來和吉歐根的案子很像
Really? That sounds like geoghan.

464
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:39,868
-這是我們的剪報嗎 -是啊 署名是迪亞哥·日巴迪內亞 1997年
Is that one of our clips? Yeah. Byline's Diego ribadineira, 1997.

465
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,308
肯定是他在做宗教工作之時回來了
Must've been back when he was working religion.

466
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:45,578
-有後續報道嗎 -沒多少 只有一小篇
- Was there any folo? - Not much. One short piece.

467
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,938
嗯 教會私下解決了
Huh. The church settled the case.

468
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,778
你不是認識吉姆·蘇利文嗎
Don't you know Jim Sullivan?

469
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,988
是啊 怎麼了
Yeah. Why?

470
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,448
看來教會找他幫忙了
Looks like the church brought him in to help out.

471
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:10,298
老天 除了曼尼還有人把球打出內場嗎
Jesus. Has anybody but Manny gotten the ball out of the infield?

472
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:12,738
沒有 你怎麼在弄那個
Nope. Why do you even bother with that thing?

473
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:14,798
它能讓我不去看比賽
It distracts me from the game.

474
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,008
知道還有什麼東西能幫到你嗎
Know what else is good for that?

475
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:19,108
噢對 好主意 該我去了
Oh, yeah. Good idea. My round.

476
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,808
-很快回來 有人要吃的嗎 -沒有
- I'll be right back. Anybody want any food? - No.

477
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:24,248
-我都有了 -嘿 帶根熱狗
- I'm all set. - Hey, a hot dog.

478
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:28,018
-你們有什麼進展嗎 -當然有
- So, you guys making any progress? - Absolutely.

479
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:30,648
-那是個好故事 -為什麼這麼說
- It's a good story. - Why?

480
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:33,118
因為你也是一個被教會惹怒的叛教者嗎
'Cause you're another lapsed catholic pissed off at the church?

481
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:35,428
-我們找到了很多猛料 -比如說呢
- We've got a lot of good stuff. - Like what?

482
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,958
我只是在專心看比賽 什麼都聽不到
I'm just watching the game. Omerta?

483
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,698
他們找到另一位神父 利亞姆·巴雷特
They got another priest-- Liam Barrett.

484
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,968
我們報道過他 我只是這麼一說 我沒說錯呀
We reported on him. I'm just saying, we did.

485
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,178
好吧 但這個傢伙
Okay, but this guy was shuffled

486
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,938
每過幾年就換一個教區
around from parish to parish every few years,

487
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,608
就像吉歐根和波特一樣
just like geoghan and Porter.

488
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,608
我覺得這有模式可循
I think there's a pattern.

489
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,878
這推測站不住腳 你還發現了什麼
Sounds thin. What else you got?

490
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:55,298
薩夏從一個受害者組織裏
Sacha's got another guy

491
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,008
找到了一個叫菲爾·薩維亞諾的傢伙
from a victims' organization-- Phil saviano.

492
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:01,018
是斯納普組織裏的嗎 哦 天吶 我們也報道過他
From snap? Oh, boy. We reported on him too.

493
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:03,218
你不是在看球賽嗎 史蒂夫
I thought you were watching the game, Steve.

494
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,788
-那傢伙被傷得很重 -我們寫過幾篇他的報道
- That guy's pretty banged up. - We did a couple stories on him.

495
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,458
他一直堅持寫信
Guy would not stop writing letters.

496
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,228
-他想發起聖戰 -怎麼 難道問他沒什麼意義嗎
- He wants a holy war. - What, so he's not worth talking to?

497
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:12,398
-你對加拉貝迪安的調查怎麼樣了 -還在查呢
- Where are you on garabedian? - I'm working on it.

498
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,958
羅比說麥克利什認為他在虛張聲勢
Robby says macleish thinks he's bluffing.

499
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:17,128
本 我覺得這裏面有料可挖
I think there's something there, Ben.

500
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:19,298
給我點可靠的證據 不然你們就別幹了
Get me something solid, or I'm taking you off it.

501
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,808
我不想我們因為這件事瞎忙活
I don't want us chasing our tails on this.

502
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:32,878
不要撞到障礙物
Stay away from that trap!

503
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,418
你想打到那裏還早得很呢 夥計
You couldn't reach that trap in a million years, partner.

504
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,488
我以前就打中過
I've reached that trap before.

505
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,318
是麼 現在輪到保羅了
Yeah. Now, Paul, maybe.

506
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,358
-怎麼樣 -挺好的
- How we doing? - We're good.

507
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:45,758
-我們領先了兩分 -很好
- We're two up on the front. - Good.

508
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,728
新編輯怎麼樣
How's that new editor working out?

509
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,998
呃 他可不怎麼喜歡棒球
Well, he doesn't like baseball.

510
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,668
但是 額 他看上去挺聰明的
But, uh, he seems like a smart guy.

511
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:55,538
嗯 我看過一篇關於他的文章
Yeah, I read an article about him.

512
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:59,108
上面說他是《環球報》第一位猶太人編輯
Said he's the first Jewish editor of the globe.

513
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:02,108
真是信息閉塞啊
Must have been a slow news day.

514
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,378
-他結婚了嗎 -沒有
- He got a family, this guy? - No.

515
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:06,248
他還沒結婚
He is not married.

516
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,418
-是離婚了嗎 -我覺得不是
- Divorced? - I don't think so, no.

517
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,498
也就是說這位《環球報》的
So the new editor at the

518
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:12,518
新編輯是有著猶太信仰的未婚男人
globe is an unmarried man of the Jewish faith

519
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:14,718
還不喜歡棒球
who hates baseball?

520
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:16,758
-是啊 -這位子應該給本的
- Yeah. - Should have given it to Ben.

521
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,458
他可是布萊德利家的人
He's a bradlee, for crying out loud.

522
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,298
我想 也許是他手舉得還不夠快吧
Didn't raise his hand fast enough, I guess.

523
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:23,698
嘿 順便一提
Hey, by the way,

524
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,938
我最近在看那個巴雷特神父的資料
I've been reading about this priest, father Barrett.

525
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,638
上面說你參與過這個案子
Said you were involved with that.

526
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:30,538
巴雷特 哦 壞傢伙
Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.

527
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,738
當時教會來找我幫忙 我就參與了
Lake street asked for help. I pitched in.

528
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,098
受害者們說當勞主教
Victim said cardinal law

529
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:37,578
從費城過來的時候就知道巴雷特的事了
knew about Barrett when he came from Philly.

530
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:39,148
這是真的嗎
Is that true?

531
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:41,988
你知道我不能談論這個案子 羅比
You know I can't talk about the case, robby.

532
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:45,258
呃 私下也不行嗎
Well... off the record?

533
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:47,818
私底下也不行 我不能說
Off the record, I can't talk about it.

534
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,788
-好吧 -這和訴訟有關係嗎
- All right. - This related to the lawsuit?

535
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,398
你知道這回事
You know about that?

536
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,428
聽著
Look,

537
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:57,898
我不認識這個叫巴倫的人 也不知道他的計劃
I don't know this guy Baron or what his agenda is.

538
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:00,168
坦白說 我也不在乎
Frankly, I don't care.

539
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,738
我只是不想你替他擋子彈
I just don't want to see you taking a bullet for him.

540
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:04,968
我覺得你太過火了
I think you're away.

541
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,248
-放在這兒 -我們走 走
- Put it over here. - Let's go. Let's go.

542
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:16,188
某天我正在上網
So the other day I was on the world wide web.

543
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,658
你想知道的任何事 在網上都找得到
Anything you want to know, it's right there.

544
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:22,028
我不得不承認 身為一個神父
Now, I have to admit that as a priest,

545
00:27:22,028 --> 00:27:24,528
這不免讓我感到有些緊張
this makes me a little nervous.

546
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:27,498
我該擔心自己的工作保障嗎
Should I be worried about job security?

547
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:30,428
我看不需要
I don't think so.

548
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:34,038
你看 知識是一回事
You see, knowledge is one thing.

549
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,708
但信仰就是另一回事了
But faith-- faith is another.

550
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,718
嘿
Hey.

551
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:56,428
嘿
Hey.

552
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:00,228
你不是應該在高爾夫或者別的什麼嗎
Shouldn't you be golfing or something?

553
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,128
高爾夫可不是個動詞
Golfing's not a verb.

554
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,198
我也沒有開球時間啊
And I couldn't get a tee time.

555
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,538
人們都是這麼稱呼的嗎 開球時間
Is that what they call it? Tee time?

556
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,038
他們還稱它為休閒活動
They also call it a leisure activity.

557
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,538
-你該試試 麥克 -我試了 我去跑步了
- You oughta try it, Mike. - I do. I run.

558
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,538
沒錯 但你是跑步來上班
Yeah. You run to work.

559
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:18,308
那你今天在這兒做什麼
So why are you here today?

560
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:20,918
-在反覆看薩維亞諾的剪報 -好吧
- Going over these clips of saviano. - Yep.

561
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:22,478
本和史蒂夫認為這條路走不通
Ben and Steve think it's a dead end.

562
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:24,648
他們在看比賽時說了一堆廢話
They gave me a bunch of crap about it at the game.

563
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:26,488
嗯 本給我發了郵件
Yeah, Ben e-mailed me.

564
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,028
-是嗎 -嗯
- He did? - Yeah.

565
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:31,588
他說我們該放手了
He said we should let it go.

566
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:33,658
那你想怎麼做
What do you want to do?

567
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,868
我想去查一下薩維亞諾
I want to bring saviano in.

568
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:38,328
那你不管這些傢伙了嗎
So, just ignore those guys?

569
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:44,038
我想我們在這件事上不該理會任何人的話
I think we oughta start ignoring everybody on this one.

570
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,908
這我可以做到
I'm good with that.

571
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,578
那麼
Well--

572
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:54,078
你覺得馬蒂對這些有什麼看法嗎
do you think Marty has any idea what's coming down the pike?

573
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:57,188
沒有 我也覺得他不在乎
Nope. I don't think he cares either.

574
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:59,258
那可真新鮮
That's refreshing.

575
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:01,358
嗯
Yeah.

576
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,358
除非他錯了
Unless he's wrong.

577
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:26,048
我一直都很喜歡報刊業
I've always been fascinated with the newspaper business.

578
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,938
我在哈佛讀書的時候曾經也和
I used to sit in on the lectures

579
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,648
內曼兄弟一起上過這樣的課程
with the neiman fellows when I was at Harvard.

580
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:34,918
我 額 在文章上看到你曾經也是一個編輯
I, uh-- I read that you were an editor once.

581
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:37,388
啊 是的
Ah, yes.

582
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,928
嗯 那是很久以前的事了
Yeah, that was a very long time ago.

583
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,298
《密西西比報》
The Mississippi register.

584
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,468
主教管區的小報紙
Small diocesan newspaper.

585
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:51,938
但對一位三十歲的牧師來說 也是一份重大的責任啊
But for a 30-year-old pastor, it was a big responsibility.

586
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,638
有時過於沉重了
Too much at times.

587
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,208
怎麼說
How so?

588
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,478
我曾和埃弗斯兄弟關係不錯
I was close with the evers brothers.

589
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:03,118
我們在公民權利的問題上表明了立場
We took a stand on civil rights.

590
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:06,188
我們的讀者不開心了
Our readership was not pleased.

591
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:08,558
他們把我當成瞎插手的局外人
They saw me as a meddling outsider.

592
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,858
我能想像
I can imagine.

593
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:16,528
這位子可不好坐 尤其是在一個小鎮子
Tough seat to sit in, especially in a small town.

594
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:20,598
我想你會發現波士頓其實也是個小地方的 馬蒂
I think you'll find that Boston's still a small town too, Marty,

595
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,038
從很多方面看都是
in many ways.

596
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,708
嗯
Hmm.

597
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:28,378
但如果有任何地方我能幫得上忙的 馬蒂 儘管直說
But if I can be of any help, Marty, don't hesitate to ask.

598
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:31,378
我發現 當一個城市裏的各個機構都
I find that the city flourishes

599
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:33,748
齊心協力的時候 這個城市就能變得繁榮
when its great institutions work together.

600
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:36,988
謝謝你
Thank you.

601
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:38,228
就我個人觀點來看
Personally I'm of the opinion

602
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,188
一份報紙要能最好地發揮它的功能
that for a paper to best perform its function,

603
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,228
它就不能依靠外在的力量
it really needs to stand alone.

604
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,128
啊 當然了
Ah. Of course.

605
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:50,198
但我的提議仍然有效
But my offer still stands.

606
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,898
謝謝你
Thank you.

607
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,998
請進
Come in.

608
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,738
哦
Ah.

609
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:00,308
謝謝 莫林
Thank you, Maureen.

610
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:04,148
一份小禮物 馬蒂
A little gift, Marty.

611
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:09,888
把它當成是紅衣主教對波士頓的指引吧
Think of it as a cardinal's guide to the city of Boston.

612
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:28,498
我是來見薩夏·法伊弗的
I'm here to see sacha pfeiffer.

613
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,908
-你的名字是 -菲爾·薩維亞諾
- Your name? - Phil saviano.

614
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:32,738
-好 稍等片刻 -嗯
- Okay, just a minute. - Mm-hmm.

615
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:36,108
我是第一個跟你們交談的倖存者嗎
So, am I the first survivor you've talked to?

616
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:37,748
對的 菲爾 你是第一個
Yeah, Phil, you are.

617
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:39,948
好吧 那麼
Okay, well,

618
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:44,288
首先我要感謝你們今天邀請我來
first of all let me say thank you for having me in today.

619
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:45,888
其次 我想知道你們是否
And I want you to know that you

620
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,518
和我所屬的斯納普組織全權合作了
have the full cooperation of my organization, snap.

621
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,628
菲爾 你的組織裏有多少人
How many members are in your organization, Phil?

622
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,128
上次開會有十一人
We had 11 at our last chapter meeting--

623
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,628
呃 不 是十個 凱倫離開了
uh, no, um, 10. Karen just moved.

624
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:58,368
-你們團隊裏還有個女人 -當然了
- You had a woman in your group? - Of course.

625
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,698
他們不會區別對待的 施虐不分男女
They don't discriminate, not when it comes to abuse.

626
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,768
這和是不是同性戀也沒關係
And this has nothing to do with being gay.

627
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:05,368
這就是神父利用職權來強姦孩子
What this is is priests using the collar to rape kids.

628
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:07,938
都是孩子啊 有男有女
Kids. Boys and girls.

629
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,718
那時我十一歲
I was 11,

630
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,658
我被伍斯特市的大衛·霍利神父折磨
and I was preyed upon by father David holley in worcester.

631
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,488
我不是說向他禱告 而是受他折磨
And I don't mean prayed for. I mean preyed upon.

632
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:28,258
-你們中有誰是天主教徒嗎 -我在信奉天主教的家庭裏長大
- Are any of you catholic? - I was raised catholic.

633
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:31,828
不過現在我去我妻子的基督教長老會
Now I go to my wife's presbyterian church.

634
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:33,438
我沒有信仰
I'm lapsed.

635
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,508
但我有時和奶奶一起去教堂
I go to church with my grandmother sometimes.

636
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:39,138
之前說我們都在信奉天主教的家庭長大是一件很光榮的事 但現在
It's safe to say we were all raised catholic, but now--

637
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,008
-沒這種感覺了 -好吧
- not so much. - Okay.

638
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,008
那麼 我告訴你們
Well, let me tell you,

639
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,358
如果你是一個出身貧寒的窮小子
when you're a poor kid from a poor family,

640
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:46,818
宗教就很重要了
religion counts for a lot.

641
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:50,488
而且若是神父能注意到你 那可是非同小可的大事
And when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal.

642
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,818
他會讓你收集讚美詩
He asks you to collect the

643
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,288
或者倒垃圾 你會覺得自己是特別的
hymnals or take out the trash, you feel special.

644
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,528
就像上帝讓你幫忙一樣
It's like god asking for help.

645
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,628
所以當他給你講黃段子的時候 你可能會覺得有點奇怪
So maybe it's a little weird when he tells you a dirty joke.

646
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:04,268
但你們有了共同的秘密 於是你選擇了順從
But now you got a secret together, so you go along.

647
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:07,668
然後他給你看色情雜誌 你也順從他
Then he shows you a porno mag, and you go along.

648
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,108
就這樣 你一直順從他 聽他的話
And you go along, and you go along,

649
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:13,608
直到某天他讓你為他打手槍或吹喇叭
until one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow job.

650
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,978
你也會順從他 因為你覺得非做不可
And so you go along with that too because you feel trapped,

651
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,618
因為他一手栽培了你
because he has groomed you.

652
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:22,118
你怎麼能對上帝說不呢 對吧
How do you say no to god, right?

653
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:23,738
你們要理解
See, it is important to

654
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:27,118
這不僅僅是身體上的虐待
understand that this is not just physical abuse.

655
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:29,788
這也是精神上的虐待
It's spiritual abuse too.

656
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:34,798
當一個神父對你做了這些事 他搶劫了你的信仰
And when a priest does this to you, he robs you of your faith.

657
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,998
所以你要麼酗酒 要麼嗑藥
So you reach for the bottle or the needle,

658
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,838
而這些都不起作用時 你就只能縱身跳橋
or if those don't work, you jump off a bridge.

659
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:41,968
這就是我們稱自己為倖存者的原因
That's why we call ourselves survivors.

660
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,258
你們讀過詹森·內裏的書嗎
Have you read Jason Berry's book?

661
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:44,968
他寫了路易斯安那的高瑟案
He wrote about the gauthe case in Louisiana.

662
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,208
-怎麼寫 -g-a-u-t-h-e
- That's g-- - g-a-u-t-h-e.

663
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,408
來 去和理查德·賽普談談吧
Here. And talk to Richard sipe.

664
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,708
他在教會的其中一間治療中心工作
He worked in one of the church's treatment centers.

665
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:54,778
他以前是神父 娶了一位修女
He's an ex-priest. Married a nun.

666
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:58,988
這給你 這是科斯案的證詞
Here. This is his testimony from the kos case.

667
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:00,558
菲爾 治療中心是什麼
Phil, what's a treatment center?

668
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:02,758
就是當神父被抓到時會被送去的地方
It's where they send priests when they get caught.

669
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:04,008
我知道的都在這盒子裏了
This is all here in the box.

670
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,758
我五年前就寄給你們了
I sent this to you guys five years ago.

671
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:09,428
呃 寄給《環球報》嗎 你寄給誰了
Uh, to the globe? Who did you send it to?

672
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:13,938
我不想說是誰 但他們表示不感興趣
I don't wanna say who, but they said they weren't interested.

673
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:17,208
但我們確實做過幾篇關於你的報道 我在剪報裏看到了
But we did run a couple stories on you. I saw them in the clips.

674
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,678
嗯 可坦白說 那根本不夠
Yeah, but to be completely frank, it wasn't enough.

675
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,778
你們要明白
You guys gotta understand.

676
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:26,348
這事關重大
This is big.

677
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:27,698
這不僅關乎波士頓
This is not just Boston.

678
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,218
它關乎整個國家 整個世界
It's the whole country. It's the whole world.

679
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:32,288
它的矛頭直指梵蒂岡
And it goes right up to the Vatican.

680
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,458
你有證據嗎 菲爾
Do you have any proof of that, Phil?

681
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,958
不 還沒 但想想吧 他們數量這麼多
No. Not yet. But there are so many of them.

682
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,298
不然他們幹嘛要極力隱瞞這麼久
How else could they have hidden it for so long?

683
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:42,268
-什麼數量那麼多 -神父啊
- So many what? - Priests!

684
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:44,428
神父
Priests!

685
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,768
我知道僅波士頓就有十三個
I know of 13 right here in Boston.

686
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:50,468
你知道波士頓有十三個神父對兒童進行性騷擾嗎
You know 13 priests in Boston who have molested children?

687
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:53,038
是啊 你為什麼要重複我說的每句話
Yeah! Why do you keep repeating everything I say?

688
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:55,408
我只是想確認清楚
I just like to clarify things.

689
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,778
早在五年前我寄給你們這些東西的時候
Maybe you should have clarified

690
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,078
你們就該搞清楚了
it five years ago when I sent you all of this stuff.

691
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:01,378
都在這裏面了
It's all right here.

692
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,988
能借用一下洗手間嗎
May I use your bathroom?

693
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,558
嗯 好啊 菲爾 走吧
Yeah, sure, Phil. Come on.

694
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:24,168
你們怎麼看
Well, what do you think?

695
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:26,678
嗯 這傢伙有備而來 這點毫無疑問
Well, the guy's got an agenda, that's for sure.

696
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,738
-你這麼認為嗎 -他明顯經歷了很多
- You think? - He's obviously been through a lot.

697
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,608
但他很聰明 而且如果他關於十三個神父的話是對的
But he's smart, and if he's right about 13 priests--

698
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,648
嗯 但我們很難相信這個傢伙
yeah, it might be a big "If" With this guy.

699
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,018
調查一下他的背景
Do a background check on him.

700
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,588
追查一下他組織裏其它倖存者的情況
And follow up with some of the other survivors of his group.

701
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:38,988
我去找這位前神父 賽普
I'll track down this ex-priest, sipe.

702
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:40,858
好 但也要盯緊加拉貝迪安 那個更重要
Okay, but stay on garabedian. That's more important.

703
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:43,458
啊 加拉貝迪安 真是煩人
Ah. Garabedian. What a pain in the ass.

704

我不是來給他們寫個人檔案的 我在做更重要的事
I'm not writing a profile here. I'm working on something bigger.

720
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:30,538
更重要 我不懂這是什麼意思
Bigger? I don't know what that means.

721
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,108
我不該告訴你這些
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

722
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,808
但我這些調查是為聚焦小組做的

723
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:37,348
-聚焦在關注這事 -嗯 我們正在調查

Um, would you mind if I took some notes? Would that be all right?

741
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:45,478
你不介意我做點筆記吧
You don't mind if I take some notes, do you?

742

-你會寫我的名字嗎 -不會

00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:52,988
我剛有了個孩子
I just had a kid.

745
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:56,058
他才一歲 但我不確定我是否想讓他知道這事
He's only one, but I'm not sure I want him to know about this.

746
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:57,988
嗯 我理解
Sure. I get that.

747
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:01,158
帕特裏克 你隨時都可以結束這個採訪 好嗎
You can stop this interview at any time, Patrick. All right?

748
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,898

Okay. All right.

749
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,668
你可以記筆記
Go ahead with your notes.

750
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,638
好的 那麼
Okay. So, um--

751
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,738
第一次事發時你們住在哪裏
where'd you live when it first happened?

752
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,848
在海德公園另一邊的樓裏
In the projects, over in Hyde park.

753
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:17,678

757
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,588

他是個十足的人渣
He was a real piece of shit.

763

我母親 也不是很穩定
And my mom, she wasn't so stable either.

都一樣不是好人
Same shit.

767
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,718
你第一次遇到吉歐根是什麼時候
When did you first meet geoghan?

768
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:58,888
我姐姐 在鄧金甜甜圈店裏看到他
Well, my sister, she saw him over in the dunkin' donuts.

769
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:01,818
告訴他父親去世了 他馬上趕了過來
Tells him about my old man passing, and he rushed right over.

770
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,238
那個修女 芭芭拉
This nun, sister Barbara,

771
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,898
負責一個組織 專門接收問題家庭來的孩子
ran this group for kids from troubled families.

772
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:08,398
嗯 那個組織在哪裏
Mm-hmm. Where was that?

773
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:10,568
額 在多爾切斯特的聖安布羅斯
Uh, St. Ambrose in Dorchester.

774
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:12,368
好的
Okay.

775
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,968
就是她把我介紹給尚利神父的
She's the one who introduced me to father shanley.

776
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:18,408
他是街區的神父
He was a street priest.

777
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:21,338
留長髮 很時髦
Long hair. Very hip.

778
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:24,008
他邀我去他後灣區[波士頓上層社會住宅區]的公寓
He invited me to his apartment in back bay.

779
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:26,878
-後灣區哪裏 -燈塔街
- Where in back bay? - Beacon street.

780
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,218
-燈塔 好的 -你是本地人嗎
- Beacon. Okay. - Are you from here?

781
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:33,058
額 不是的 我在俄亥俄州長大 但我母親是南方人
Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio, but my mom's from southie.

782
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:36,988
好吧 所以你懂的 我之前從沒見過後灣區
All right, so you get it. I'd never even seen back bay.

783
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:41,858
那第一次見面後發生了什麼呢 喬
So what happened on that first visit, Joe?

784
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:45,998
呃 一開始他很好 很有趣 也很隨意
Well, he was very nice at first, very funny, very casual.

785
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:50,008
我覺得他看得出來我是同性戀
And I think he could tell I was gay,

786
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:53,438
他讓我看了他的手機 趴在嬰兒床上看的
so he showed me this mobile he had, like over a baby's crib.

787
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:56,848
-嗯 -但是給我看了很多不同的東西
- Mm-hmm. - But with different words.

788
00:39:56,848 --> 00:39:59,878
什麼同性戀 跨性別 還有雙性戀
"Homosexual." "Transsexual." "Bisexual."

789
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:02,788
嗯 你那時知道自己是同性戀嗎 喬
Okay. And did you know you were gay at that time, Joe?

790
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,848
知道
Yeah.

791
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,128
但我沒有告訴任何人
But that wasn't information

792
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,288
在多爾切斯特沒人知道
I was sharing with anybody. Not in Dorchester.

793
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:11,028
嗯
Okay.

794
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:14,028
他讓你看了手機之後呢
So, what happened after he showed you the mobile?

795
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:16,968
呃 我有點被嚇到了
Well, I was a little freaked out.

796
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:19,698
我想他看出來了
I think he could tell.

797
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,338
於是他說 你知道嗎 我們來玩脫衣撲克會好一點哦
So he said, you know, what'll help is if we play strip poker.

798
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:26,778
毫無疑問我輸了
Of course I lost.

799
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,148
然後 額 事情就發生了
And, uh, things went on from there.

800
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:33,718
你能給我講講細節嗎
Can you tell me specifically what happened?

801
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:37,388
細節就是 他
Specifically, he--

802
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,118
他對我性騷擾
he molested me.

803
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:46,498
喬 我想這時候我們要很注意用語
Joe, I think that the language is gonna be so important here.

804
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:49,928
我們不能美化這件事 只說「性騷擾」是不夠的
We can't sanitize this. Just saying "Molest" Isn't enough.

805
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:52,898
人們得知道究竟發生了什麼
People need to know what actually happened.

806
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:58,338
-我們應該把這些打包帶走 -是的
- We should probably get these to go. - Right.

807
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:02,178
吉歐根來了 我母親 你知道 她
Geoghan shows up, and my mom, you know, she's--

808
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:03,848
她很激動
she's thrilled.

809
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:07,118
我是說 就像看到上帝似的 你懂吧
I mean, this was like god showing up, you know?

810
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:09,988
嗯 之後發生什麼了呢
Sure. Right. So what happened then?

811
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:14,518
你真的要聽這些破事嗎
You really want to hear this shit?

812
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:17,088
對 帕特裏克 我要聽
Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.

813
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:27,698
他說帶我去吃冰激凌
He offers to take me to get ice cream.

814
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,938
你知道的 他是神父 我是小孩 所以我就去了
You know, he's a priest, I'm a kid, so I go.

815
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:32,708
嗯
Sure.

816
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,078
然後我們開車回家
So we're driving home and he--

817
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:40,018
他開始輕拍我的腿
he starts patting my leg and--

818
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,248
然後
you know, then...

819
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:47,988
他的手就滑過來了
His hand just slides right up and he--

820
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,228
然後抓住我的性器
he grabs my dick.

821
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:52,728
你知道嗎 我都呆住了
You know, I-- I just froze up.

822
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:55,958
我完全嚇呆了 動彈不得
I was fucking petrified. I-I couldn't move.

823
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:58,968
我不知道怎麼辦 那時我還是個孩子
I didn't know what to do. I was just a little kid.

824
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,298
嗯
Yeah.

825
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:08,908
你知道 我壓根都沒吃到冰激凌
You know, I never even touched my ice cream.

826
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:11,308
它就在我手裏融化了
It just melted down my arm.

827
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,248
那你 額
Did you, um--

828
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:23,288
那以後你還有見他嗎
did you see him again after that?

829
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:29,828
嗯
Yeah.

830
00:42:32,568 --> 00:42:36,368
好了 可以了 這次就先說這麼多吧
All right. That's good. Let's stop there for now.

831
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,738
好
Sure.

832
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:40,938
他說這樣做能讓我更適應自己的身體
He said it was a way to make me more comfortable with my body.

833
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:43,848
嗯 那這之後呢
Mmm. So what happened after that?

834
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:46,618
嗯 他脫下自己的衣服說
Well, he took off his clothes and he said,

835
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:48,248
「我一直以來都很壓抑
"I've been so depressed,

836
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:51,348
但也許你能讓我開心點 幫我吹喇叭」
but maybe you can cheer me up and give me a blow job."

837
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,018
真是謙謙君子
Classy guy.

838
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:56,488
-那你照做了嗎 -我做了
- And did you? - Yeah.

839
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:59,528
我想你肯定在想
I know you must be thinking,

840
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,818
為什麼我會為一個比我
why would I ever do that to

841
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:02,968
大三十歲的奇葩做這種事
some creepy guy who's 30 years older than me?

842
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:04,748
但你要明白
But what you have to understand

843
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,098
這是我人生中第一次
is that this is the first time in my life

844
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:09,708
有人告訴我同性戀並沒有什麼錯
that someone told me that it was okay to be gay.

845
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,568
-而且他還是一個神父 -嗯
- And it was a priest. - Right.

846
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:14,708
所以你為他口交了
So you had oral sex.

847
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,208
你們有過性行為嗎
Did you have intercourse?

848
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,748
有
Yes.

849
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:20,948
不是當時 是後來
Not then, but later.

850
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:24,148
那讓我痛苦了很久
It really messed me up.

851
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:28,988
我現在清醒了 但那 那就是一切的開始
I'm sober now, but that-- that was the beginning of it all.

852
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:33,998
那讓我十分困惑 你懂吧
It's very confusing, you know,

853
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:37,168
通過這種方式瞭解性是什麼
to be introduced to sex like that and then--

854
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:39,568
然後喜歡上男人 實在是
and then to be attracted to men, it's--

855
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:45,068
抱歉 我就知道我會忍不住的
I'm sorry. I knew I was gonna do this.

856
00:43:45,078 --> 00:43:47,008
-哦 抱歉 -沒關係
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.

857
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:49,108
沒事了 喬 沒事了
It's okay, Joe. It's okay.

858
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,248
那裏是有一個教堂
Of course there is a church right there.

859
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:54,018
還有一個操場
And a playground.

860
00:43:54,018 --> 00:43:56,688
喬 你有試過和誰講這些嗎
Joe, did you ever try and tell anyone?

861
00:43:56,688 --> 00:43:59,418
和誰講呢 神父嗎
Like who? A priest?

862
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,918
能用一下你的電話嗎
Can I use your phone?

863
00:44:01,928 --> 00:44:04,358
好的 你知道放在哪兒
Yeah, sure. You know where it is.

864
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,558
如果你想的話可以寫我的名字
You can use my name if you want.

865
00:44:07,598 --> 00:44:09,028
謝謝 帕特裏克
Thanks, Patrick.

866
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:12,268
不要謝我 把那些混蛋抓住 好嗎
Don't thank me. Just get these assholes, will you?

867
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,438
他是其中的幸運兒
He's one of the lucky ones.

868
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:23,608
至少他還活著
He's still alive.

869
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:34,158
-要來杯茶嗎 薩夏 -不了 奶奶 謝謝
- Do you want a cup of tea, sacha? - I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.

870
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:40,198
-你好 -嗨 喬 我是薩夏·法伊弗
- Hello? - Hi, Joe. It's sacha pfeiffer.

871
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:42,558
-嗨 薩夏 你好嗎 -很好 謝謝
- Hi, sacha. How are you? - I'm good, thanks.

872
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:46,668
呃 聽著 喬 我只想再問一件事
Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.

873
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:49,298
你向菲爾·薩維亞諾說過這些 是嗎
You talked to Phil saviano about all of this, right?

874
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:51,668
嗯 是的 我去過幾次斯納普的會議
Yeah, I did. I went to a couple of snap meetings.

875
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:54,738
菲爾有沒有建議你採取一些措施呢
And did Phil ever suggest you do anything about it?

876
00:44:54,748 --> 00:44:57,648
沒有 會議也不是關於這些的
No. The meetings weren't really about that.

877
00:44:57,648 --> 00:44:59,588
其中一些人找了律師
A couple of them had gone to a lawyer,

878
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,378
但我覺得不值得
but I didn't think it was worth it.

879
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,018
為什麼
Why not?

880
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:05,848
去那裏要填很多表 太耗費時間精力了
There were just so many forms to fill out. It was overwhelming.

881
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,418
他說最多也只能為我爭取到一點賠償 所以
And he said he could only get me a small settlement, so--

882
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:11,158
-誰說的 -那個律師說的
- wh-who said that? - The lawyer told me that.

883
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,158
所以你是有去見過律師
So you did go and see a lawyer?

884
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,248
嗯 但最後還是沒有用
Yeah, but I didn't end up using him,

885
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,268
所以我想這個也不重要吧
so I didn't think it was important.

886
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,598
抱歉 我沒有要隱瞞的意思
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hide anything.

887
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:23,268
不 我知道的 喬
No, I-I-I know, Joe.

888
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,838
你還記得那個律師的名字嗎
Do you remember his name? The lawyer?

889
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:28,708
不 但菲爾可能會知道
No. But maybe Phil would know.

890
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,948
他在波特案時經常出鏡 長得也很帥
The guy was on TV a lot during the Porter case. He was handsome.

891
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:34,518
是埃裏克·麥克利什嗎
Was it Eric macleish?

892
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:37,048
嗯 就是他 麥克利什
Yeah, that's it. Macleish.

893
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,088
我覺得他很帥
I thought he was very handsome.

894
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:43,758
-嗨 -嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

895
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:45,028
我剛剛在新聞編輯室
I was just in the newsroom.

00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:46,958
斯威尼法官確定了聽證會的日期

Canellos started a pool. Ten bucks to get in.

900
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:55,468
有人買《環球報》贏嗎
Anyone picking the globe?

901
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:57,768
他坐的莊是斯威尼要用多久來否決我們
He's only taking bets on how fast sweeney rules against us.

902
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,208
羅比
Robby.

903
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,878
-收到我的留言了嗎 -收到了
- Did you get my message? - I did.

904
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:05,108
看樣子尚利神父就是我們的第四位了
Looks like father shanley could be our fourth priest.

905
00:46:05,118 --> 00:46:06,748
嗯 我想是的
Yeah, I think he is.

906
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,478
-你追查麥克利什了嗎 -我剛剛和菲爾談過了
- Did you follow up with macleish? - I just talked to Phil.

907
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:11,648
他說麥克利什處理了很多這種案子
He said macleish dealt with a number of these cases.

908
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:14,288
-看來他忘記說了 -嗯
- Guess he forgot to mention that. - Yeah.

909
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,288
明天我要去法庭
I'm gonna go to the courthouse tomorrow,

910
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:18,958
看看能不能找到他經手的起訴教會的案子
see if I can find any cases he settled against the church.

911

917
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,948
還有些人不坐穿編輯室的椅子
I got guys who won't leave till he does.

918
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:40,778
是絕對不會離開的
He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.

我覺得薩維亞諾可能是可信的 本
I think saviano might be legit, Ben.

927
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:03,768
想給我解釋一下嗎
Want to elaborate on that?

928
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:06,038
不 還不行
No. Not really.

929
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:09,578
只是覺得事情彷彿越發複雜了 我的直覺
It just feels like this thing's stacking up. That's my gut.

930
00:47:12,648 --> 00:47:14,678

940

-當然可以 -好極了
- Of course. Yeah. - Great.

941
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:45,478
菲爾說你以前在一個巴爾的摩的
Uh, so Phil told me that you were working

942
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:48,748
一個教會治療中心工作
a-at one of the church's treatment centers in Baltimore.

943
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:51,588
是的 西頓精神科研究所
Yes. The seton psychiatric institute.

944
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:53,588
由仁愛修女會運營
It was run by the daughters of charity.

945
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:57,058
那是什麼時候 理查德
And, uh, when was that, Richard?

946
00:47:57,058 --> 00:48:01,558
我1965年加入了這個研究所
Well, I started my psychotherapy fellowship there in 1965,

947
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:03,728
-恩 -我在那裏呆了五年
- okay. - And I was there for five years,

948
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,138
但接下來我花了三十年
but I spent the next 30

949
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:07,768
研究性侵別人的神父和那些受害者
studying abusive priests and their victims.

950
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:09,268
-真的嗎 -恩
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

951
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:11,368
所以你一直關注的就只有這個嗎
And that's-- that's been your sole focus?

952
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:13,228
聽著 麥克 教會想讓
Look, Mike, the church wants

953
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:16,278
大家覺得裏面只有幾隻害群之馬
us to believe that it's just a few bad apples.

954
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:18,248
但這只是冰山一角
But it's a much bigger problem than that.

955
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,048
問題有多嚴重 理查德
How much bigger, Richard?

956
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:22,078
根據我的調查
Well, based on the research,

957
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:25,848
我將它歸為一種可識別的精神現象
I would classify it as a recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.

958
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,658
可真是大問題啊
That's big.

959
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:35,128
-嘿 麥可 -嘿
- Hey, Mac. - Hey.

960
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,178
如果我想要一個神父的歷史資料
If I wanted historical data on a priest,

961
00:48:37,178 --> 00:48:38,768
想知道他所分配的教區
parishes he's been assigned to,

962
00:48:38,768 --> 00:48:40,238
我在哪裏可以找到這些資料
where would I find that?

963
00:48:40,238 --> 00:48:41,858
吉歐根那件案子嗎 都在那些剪報裏
The geoghan case? It's all in the clips.

964
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:43,038
麗莎有資料
Lisa has the source material.

965
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:44,488
如果是另一個神父呢
What if it was for another priest,

966
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,968
沒有上過報紙的
one that hadn't been in the papers?

967
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:48,878
你在找另一個神父 誰啊
You're looking at another priest? Who you looking at?

968
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:50,448
有辦法嗎
Any ideas?

969
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:53,248
拜託 馬特 你不打算告訴我嗎
Come on, Matt. You're not gonna tell me?

970
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:55,678
我要去開會了 謝謝你 麥可 你好啊 史蒂夫
I gotta get to a meeting. Thanks, Mac. Hey, Steve.

971
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,658
總教區出版了年度名錄
The archdiocese puts out an annual directory,

972
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:00,958
每個神父和教區都有記錄
every priest and parish.

973
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,488
好極了
That's great.

974
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,728
有98年以前的嗎
Do these go back any further than '98?

975
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:06,998
恩 一直到八十年代
Oh, yeah. Going back to the '80s in the mez.

976
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:08,628
更早以前的話 你得去波士頓公共圖書館了
Beyond that, you gotta go to bpl.

977
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,228
-謝了 麗莎 -不客氣
- The mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa. - You bet.

978
00:49:12,338 --> 00:49:14,968
他說他們的目標是同一種孩子
He said they all target the same kind of kid.

979
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:18,668
家庭收入低 沒有父親 家庭支離破碎
Low-income families, absentee fathers, broken homes.

980
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:19,698
因此吉歐根這種人
So a guy like geoghan

981
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,838
找上這些男孩不是因為他偏愛他們
goes after boys not because he prefers them,

982
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,608
而是因為這些男孩更懂羞恥 不喜歡說話
but because they have more shame, less likely to talk.

983
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:26,278
恩
Hmm.

984
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:27,948
-這些人就是禽獸 羅比 -嗯
- These guys are predators, robby. - Yeah.

985
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,518
我和賽普談過了
I-I-I talked to sipe.

986
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,448
他說在六十年代的西頓研究所見過許多這樣的神父
He said he's seen dozens of them in the '60s in seton.

987
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,118
他稱之為一種「現象」
He called it a "Phenomenon."

988
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:35,858
-他為什麼沒有揭示於眾 -他有
- Why didn't he go public? - He did.

989
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:38,488
但教會竭力敗壞了他的名聲
But the church made a huge effort to discredit him.

990
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:41,658
惡意宣傳 有威望的主教還發表公開聲明
Smear campaigns, public statements by prominent bishops.

991
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:44,528
就像薩維亞諾和加拉貝迪安說的一樣
It's just like saviano said. And garabedian.

992
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:47,668
-你有什麼進展嗎 -找到更多的受害者
- You getting anywhere with him? - More victims.

993
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,838
更多的受害者 你沒有問到底嗎
More victims. You can't empty his pockets?

994
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,038
我會盡力的 但是要更多時間
I'll get to him. I just need more time.

995
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:53,938
拜託了 麥克 你得搞定他
Come on, Mike. You gotta get him.

996
00:49:53,938 --> 00:49:55,708
我會的 我會的
I'll get him. I'll get him.

997
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:00,178
天吶 這是什麼怪味
Jesus. What the hell is that smell?

998
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:02,618
角落裏有一隻死老鼠
There's a dead rat in the corner.

999
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:04,448
-你找到了什麼 -教會的名錄
- What have you got? - Church directories.

1000
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,418
上面有馬薩諸塞州每個神父的名字
It's every priest in Massachusetts,

1001
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:08,218
還有他們所在的教區
what parish they're assigned to.

1002
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:10,728
-是官方資料嗎 -恩 我覺得可以在裏面
- Are these official? - Yeah. I figured it could help us track down

1003
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:12,428
找到一些薩維亞諾提到過的神父
some of the priests saviano mentioned,

1004
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:13,728
也許能找到更多的受害者
maybe find some more victims.

1005
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:15,898
-能開點燈嗎 -我找不到開關
- Can we turn on some more lights? - I couldn't find the switch.

1006
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:18,228
-你要我的眼鏡嗎 -不 不用
- You wanna borrow my glasses? - No, I'm good. I'm good.

1007
00:50:18,238 --> 00:50:19,998
看 1983年
Look. 1983.

1008
00:50:19,998 --> 00:50:22,898
約翰·吉歐根 多切斯特聖布蘭登街教區
John geoghan, St. Brendan's parish, Dorchester.

1009
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:25,368
我們可以找到任何一年的任何神父嗎
So we can find out where any priest is in any given year?

1010
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:28,138
恩 我找到了
Yeah, I got him here at--

1011
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:30,248
-哈 -什麼
- huh. - What?

1012
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:32,378
1980年 吉歐根從教區離職
1980. The year geoghan was pulled from jp.

1013
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:34,218
上面說他在休病假
It says he's on sick leave.

1014
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:36,318
不會吧 真的嗎
Come on. It really says that?

1015
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:40,088
1991年的在哪裏
Where is, uh, 1991?

1016
00:50:40,088 --> 00:50:41,758
這裏
Yeah. Here ya go.

1017
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:44,228
我看看利亞姆·巴雷特
Let me see this. Barrett. Barrett. Liam.

1018
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:46,928
我看不清 幫我找找利亞姆·巴雷特
I can't read that. Look for a Liam Barrett in there.

1019
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:50,398
1991年他從查爾斯頓離職
1991's the year they pulled him out of charlestown.

1020
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:53,538
「利亞姆·巴雷特」
"Barrett, Liam."

1021
00:50:53,538 --> 00:50:55,998
-恩 -「休病假」
- Yeah. - "Sick leave."

1022
00:50:57,108 --> 00:50:59,068
這是官方說法
It's an official designation.

1023
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:02,778
把這些拿到樓上
Let's get these upstairs.

1024
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:05,108
馬特 你查查看薩維亞諾告訴我們的神父
Matt, check on those priests saviano gave us.

1025
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:07,618
-我是羅比 -我在法庭
- Robby. - I'm down at the courthouse.

1026
00:51:07,618 --> 00:51:09,378
有點不對勁
Something's not right here.

1027
00:51:09,388 --> 00:51:12,118
-尚利的也沒有 薩夏 -好的 謝謝
- Nothing on shanley either, sacha. - Okay, thanks.

1028
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:15,718
-我們得再找麥克利什談話 -真的嗎 為什麼
- Um, we need to talk to macleish again. -Really. Why?

1029
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:19,428
這裏什麼也沒有 任何記錄都沒有
Huh? There's nothing here. There aren't any records.

1030
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:26,898
多謝等待 抱歉夥計們 我一直在接電話
Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys. Stuck on a call.

1031
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:28,798
-沒事 你怎麼樣 -很好
- Not a problem. How are you? - Good.

1032
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:30,768
-謝謝和我們會面 -應該的 什麼事
- Thanks for meeting us. - You bet. What's up, guys?

1033
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:34,608
麥克利什先生 你認識一個叫保羅·尚利的神父嗎
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar with a priest named Paul shanley?

1034
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:37,478
恩 我認識
Yes, I am familiar with him.

1035
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:42,078
你有處理過尚利神父的案子嗎
And have you settled cases against father shanley?

1036
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:46,718
你們能理解的 我不能告訴你們
As I'm sure you can understand, I can't discuss that with you.

1037
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:50,758
恩 那羅納德·帕奎因神父呢
Yeah, h-how about, uh, father Ronald paquin?

1038
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:55,758
我也不能告訴你們 拜託了
Well, I can't discuss that with you either. Come on, guys.

1039
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:58,468
我們知道你幫他們處理過幾場官司
We understand you've settled several cases against each of them.

1040
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:01,498
即使我是有參與這些官司
Even if I'd been involved in those cases,

1041
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:03,308
調解結果也是保密的
the settlements would be confidential

1042
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:06,408
如果我說出來的話 會被取消律師資格
and I could be disbarred for acknowledging their existence.

1043
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:09,408
-好嗎 -恩
- Okay? - Mm-hmm.

1044
00:52:09,408 --> 00:52:11,578
聽著 我說過這些案子很棘手
Look, I told you guys these are tough cases.

1045
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:15,948
大多數人只想他們承認
Most of these folks, they just want some acknowledgment

1046
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,688
發生了什麼事情
of what happened.

1047
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,358
讓他們和主教坐下來 拿點鈔票
We got 'em a sit-down with the bishop and a little dough,

1048
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,258
這是最好的結果了
and that's the best they could hope for.

1049
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:27,198
當然了 這是神父所期待的最好結果
Well, it's certainly the best the priests could hope for.

1050
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,408
不 教會保證了
No, the church promised

1051
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:30,668
他們會開除這些神父
they'd take the priests out of circulation.

1052
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:33,598
你有後續跟進嗎
And did you follow up on that?

1053
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,968
你們還有什麼事嗎
Do you guys need anything else?

1054
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:42,878
有 為什麼沒有任何記錄
Yes. Why aren't there any records?

1055
00:52:42,878 --> 00:52:44,978
我之前在法庭
I was down at the courthouse earlier.

1056
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:47,118
那裏沒有任何關於這些調解結果的記錄
There aren't any records of any of these settlements.

1057
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:51,688
我們直接和教會溝通的
We dealt directly with the church.

1058
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:57,858
我們起草一份交款通知書 送到了主教辦公室
We would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery.

1059
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:01,398
-你沒在法院上提交過任何文件嗎 -這是私人調解
- You never filed anything in court? - It's a private mediation.

1060
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:04,068
那麼 這只是
So, this is just you

1061
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:08,668
你和總教區的律師在操作嗎
and the archdiocese's lawyers in a room?

1062
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:11,338
-是的 -還有其他人嗎
- Correct. - Anyone else?

1063
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:12,788
有時候教會會請
Occasionally the church would

1064
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:15,078
其他辯護律師來幫忙
bring in another defense attorney to help out.

1065
00:53:15,078 --> 00:53:16,948
你知道他們的名字嗎
You have names?

1066
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:20,218
不 我不知道
Nope. No, I don't.

1067
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:23,218
那這一切都是私下操縱咯
So this was all under the table?

1068
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:25,248
根本沒有文件可循
There's no paper trail at all.

1069
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:26,278
為了達成私下和解
The victim has to sign a

1070
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,318
受害者不得不簽保密協議
confidentiality agreement to get the settlement.

1071
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:31,358
律師作為第三方 然後教會隱瞞真相
The lawyer takes a third, and the church sweeps it under the rug.

1072
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,258
-這完全是非法的啊 -事情還要更複雜
- It's a freakin' racket. - It's more complicated than that.

1073
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:35,478
麥克利什有責任
Macleish has got a duty

1074
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,698
讓客戶得到最好的結果
to the client to get the best deal he can.

1075
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,208
當然 但他們要代表多少受害者
Sure. But how many victims do you

1076
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,538
從中獲取多少利益才能出手幫忙
represent and profit from before you say something?

1077
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,668
加拉貝迪安會說一個也沒有
Garabedian would say none.

1078
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,708
這就是為什麼他要把這些案子送上法庭
That's why he's taking these cases to court.

1079
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:48,238
-他想要人們知道這件事 -我同意
- He wants people to know about this. - I agree.

1080
00:53:48,248 --> 00:53:50,408
本 先把法律道德放一邊
And legal ethics aside, Ben,

1081
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:52,248
像麥克利什這樣的處理方式
I mean, operating the way macleish has

1082
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:55,778
只會讓這些侵害案件不為人知
all but guarantees that the abuse stays under wraps.

1083
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:58,888
恩 麥克利什確認了薩維亞諾說的那些神父嗎
Yeah. Did macleish confirm all saviano's priests?

1084
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:03,628
沒有 他受到了保密協議的限制
No. He's limited by his confidentiality agreement.

1085
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,628
但他顯然調解了很多神父的案子
But clearly he's settled cases against a number of them.

1086
00:54:06,628 --> 00:54:08,958
菲爾讓我聯繫到了一些其他受害者
Phil's put me in touch with some of the other victims.

1087
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,528
我相信能找到所有神父
I'm pretty confident all of his priests are gonna check out.

1088
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,038
所以是有十三個神父嗎
So it is 13 priests?

1089
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:16,808
-恩 -看起來是這樣
- Yeah. - Looks that way.

1090
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:18,868
天吶
Holy shit.

1091
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,608
好的 繼續努力
Okay. Keep going.

1092
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:28,948
抱歉 你叫什麼
I'm sorry. What was the name again?

1093
00:54:29,888 --> 00:54:31,718
額 巴倫
Uh, baron.

1094
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:35,818
B-a-r-o-n
B-a-r-o-n.

1095
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:38,988
我沒找到 等一會兒
I'm having trouble finding it. Just give me a second.

1096
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:41,458
沒事了 金姆 我為他擔保
It's okay, Kim. I can vouch for him.

1097
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:44,398
我是皮特·康利 天主教慈善會的董事
I'm Pete conley. I'm on the board of catholic charities.

1098
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:46,098
歡迎來到波士頓 巴倫先生
Welcome to Boston, Mr. Baron.

1099
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:48,838
-謝謝 -感謝你加入我們
- Thank you. - I appreciate you joining us.

1100
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,568
我們對在波士頓所做的工作感到很自豪
We're very proud of the work we do here in Boston.

1101
00:54:52,578 --> 00:54:55,338
主教說你之前跟他見過面 聊得挺愉快的
Oh, the cardinal said you had a nice visit.

1102
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:57,008
是的 沒錯
Yes, we did.

1103
00:54:57,008 --> 00:55:01,248
他是個很了不起的人 很高興你們有機會能一起談話
He's an extraordinary man. I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

1104
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:16,528
玩得開心嗎
Enjoying yourself?

1105
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:20,998
老實說 我不太擅長參加這些活動
Uh, to be honest, these events aren't really my strong suit.

1106
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:23,938
-恩 -你參加了慈善會嗎
- Yeah. - Are you involved with the charity?

1107
00:55:23,938 --> 00:55:26,438
沒有 我有些朋友參加了
Not directly, no. Several of my friends are.

1108
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:29,008
我們都讀的波士頓天主教高中
We all went to high school at bc high.

1109
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:31,648
就在《環球報》的對面
That's the school across the street from the globe.

1110
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:33,748
-很容易看到嘛 -恩
- It's hard to miss. - Yeah.

1111
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,378
而且逃課還很容易被抓到
Hard to get away from too, apparently.

1112
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:42,158
如果你想見紅衣主教的話
The, uh, cardinal's in the corner,

1113
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:43,728
他就在那邊
if you're so inclined.

1114
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:45,828
-我們見過了 -真的嗎
- We've met. - Really?

1115
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,058
他有提到起訴嗎
Did he mention the suit?

1116
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:51,068
沒有 但他給了我一本《教義問答書》
No, but he did give me a copy of the catechism.

1117
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:52,368
好吧
Yeah.

1118
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:54,838
他的精明並不是眾人皆知的
Well, the cardinal's not known for his subtlety.

1119
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:56,568
在調查波特的時候
During the Porter investigation,

1120
00:55:56,568 --> 00:56:00,408
他真的借用了神的力量對《環球報》進行壓制
he literally called down the power of god on the globe.

1121
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:02,138
此話怎講
How'd that play out?

1122
00:56:02,148 --> 00:56:05,878
一周後 我們的編輯在滑雪時摔斷了腿
A week later, our editor broke his leg skiing.

1123
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,978
要鮮蝦吐司嗎 先生們
Shrimp toast, gentlemen?

1124
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,118
-不 謝謝 -謝謝
- Uh, no, thanks. - Thanks.

1125
00:56:12,388 --> 00:56:16,488
你說有個受害人提起了刑事訴訟嗎
You said one of the victims filed a criminal complaint?

1126
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:19,258
恩 有一些
Yeah, there were a few of them.

1127
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:21,098
但是教會的同伴起訴後
But the judge had the case records sealed

1128
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:23,228
法官就密封了案件記錄
after friends of the church complained.

1129
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:25,328
而且教會的人脈眾多
And the church has a lot of friends.

1130
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,768
比如埃裏克·麥克利什嗎
Like Eric macleish?

1131
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,768
恩
Yeah.

1132
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,768
我只能說他嘴太嚴了 我們得找別的方法
Let's just say he's not part of the solution.

1133
00:56:32,778 --> 00:56:34,938
-你聽懂我的意思了嗎 -當然
- You follow what I'm saying? - Sure.

1134
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:36,948
你工作真賣力 雷贊德斯先生
You work hard, Mr. Rezendes.

1135
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:39,848
-你結婚了嗎 -恩
- Are you married? - Yeah.

1136
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:41,428
你妻子不介意你
Your wife doesn't mind you

1137
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:43,918
-整天工作嗎 -噢 她介意
- working all the time? - Oh, yeah, she does.

1138
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:48,788
這就是為什麼我沒有結婚 我太忙了
That's why I never got married. I'm too busy.

1139
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:51,128
我的工作太重要了
What I do is too important.

1140
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:52,858
恩
Mmm.

1141
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,628
你們的新編輯是個猶太人 對嗎
Your new editor, he's a Jew, right?

1142
00:56:57,628 --> 00:56:59,298
恩 是的
That's right. Yeah.

1143
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:01,298
你看 他一進來
Well, see, he comes in

1144
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,808
大家突然都對教會有了興趣
and suddenly everybody's interested in the church.

1145
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:05,968
你知道為什麼嗎
You know why? Mmm.

1146
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:09,578
因為他是旁觀者清 跟我一樣
Because it takes an outsider, like me.

1147
00:57:09,578 --> 00:57:11,278
我是亞美尼亞人
I'm Armenian.

1148
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,348
你認識多少在波士頓的亞美尼亞人
How many Armenians do you know in Boston?

1149
00:57:14,618 --> 00:57:16,548
史蒂夫·柯吉恩 在《環球報》上班
Steve kurkjian. Works at the globe.

1150
00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:20,818
噢 你認識兩個了 真該給你頒個獎
Oh. That's two. You should get a prize or something.

1151
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:24,128
-你是哪裏人 意大利人嗎 -不 我是葡萄牙人
- What are you, Italian? - No, I'm Portuguese.

1152
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:27,328
-哪裏來的 -波士頓東區
- From where? - Uh, east Boston.

1153
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,328
真的嗎 波士頓東區
Really? East Boston?

1154
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:34,498
你口音聽起來不像啊
You don't sound like it.

1155
00:57:40,678 --> 00:57:45,178
這座城市 這些人
This city, these people--

1156
00:57:45,178 --> 00:57:47,848
讓我們這些外來人覺得沒有歸屬感
making the rest of us feel like we don't belong.

1157
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:50,178
但他們並不比我們優秀
But they're no better than us.

1158
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:52,318
看看他們如何對待孩子的吧
Look at how they treat their children.

1159
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:56,288
記住我的話 雷贊德斯先生
Mark my words, Mr. Rezendes,

1160
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:58,688
環境可以塑造一個孩子
if it takes a village to raise a child,

1161
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:01,458
也可以毀了一個孩子
it takes a village to abuse one.

1162
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:06,528
嘿 你來了
Hey, here he is.

1163
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:08,698
-要喝酒嗎 -樂意之至
- Want a beer? - Love one.

1164
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,198
再來一杯
Another.

1165
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,538
-和芭芭拉一起來的嗎 -不 她不喜歡來這些地方
- You here with Barbara? - No, no. She hates these things.

1166
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:14,808
凱倫也是
Karen too. Yeah.

1167
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:16,378
女人真聰明
Smart ladies.

1168
00:58:16,378 --> 00:58:17,948
-乾杯 -乾杯
- Slente. - Slente.

1169
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:21,878
我見到了你的新編輯
Mmm. I met your new editor.

1170
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,618
看起來是個不錯的人
Seemed like a decent fellow.

1171
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:25,288
我覺得是的
I think he is.

1172
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:29,858
嘿 前些天我和埃裏克·麥克利什
Hey, I had an interesting conversation

1173
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:31,988
談了一些有趣的東西
with Eric macleish the other day.

1174
00:58:31,998 --> 00:58:33,978
原來多年來他一直
Turns out he's been settling

1175
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:37,028
在幫總教區調解性侵兒童案
abuse cases with the archdiocese for years.

1176
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:40,368
你真的想在這裏談這個嗎
You really want to talk about this here?

1177
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:46,468
吉姆 你說你幫了巴雷特神父當是人情
Jim, you said you helped out on father Barrett as a favor.

1178
00:58:46,478 --> 00:58:48,308
只有那一次嗎
That was a one-off?

1179
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:55,218
你還參與了多少件案子
How many of these cases you been involved with?

1180
00:58:55,218 --> 00:58:57,988
你知道我不能回答 羅比 這是違反職業道德的
You know I can't answer that, robby. It's unethical.

1181
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:00,958
真的僅僅因為這個嗎
Is that all it is?

1182
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:07,398
這就是我一直有所耳聞
So, this would be the robby Robinson

1183
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:09,758
但卻素未謀面的羅比·羅賓森
I've always heard about but never met.

1184
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:11,428
哈
Huh?

1185
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,738
聽我說 吉米
Listen to me, Jimmy.

1186
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:15,898
你得選對邊
You want to be on the right side of this.

1187
00:59:17,938 --> 00:59:20,778
你說的可是教會啊 羅比
This is the church you're talking about, robby.

1188
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:22,738
看看四周 他們都是好人
Look around. These are good people.

1189
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:24,848
為這座城市做了很多好事
Done a lot of good for this city.

1190
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:27,978
你就好好玩吧
Enjoy the party.

1191
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:39,028
我現在看了很多名錄
I've been through a lot of these now.

1192
00:59:39,028 --> 00:59:40,728
他們將這些神父開除時
"Sick leave" Isn't the only designation they use

1193
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:42,958
不光會聲稱「休病假」
when they take one of these priests out of circulation.

1194
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:45,198
他們用一堆說法 「未出席」
They use a slew of terms: "Absent on leave,"

1195
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,598
「未分配」 「應急響應」
"Unassigned," "Emergency response."

1196
00:59:47,598 --> 00:59:50,368
-這些人什麼詞都用上了 -除了強姦
- They got a word for everything, these guys. - Except rape.

1197
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:52,908
而且他們比其他神父更頻繁地更換教區
And they move parishes way more frequently than other priests.

1198
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:54,288
在我小時候
When I was a kid, a priest moved

1199
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:56,238
一個神父過了七八年才走 有時候更久
after seven or eight years, sometimes longer.

1200
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:58,808
這些人頂多兩三年就走了
These guys, it's two to three years tops.

1201
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:01,218
薩維亞諾說的神父後面都是這麼寫的嗎
And did they use these designations for all of saviano's priests?

1202
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,448
恩 這是個很明顯的模式
Yeah. It's a pretty clear pattern.

1203
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,448
夥計們 賽普打電話來了
Guys, I got sipe.

1204
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:08,488
我覺得如果你們真的想理解這場危機
I think if you really want to understand the crisis,

1205
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:11,128
你們要先從禁慾需求開始著手
you need to start with the celibacy requirement.

1206
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:13,228
那是我的第一個主要發現
That was my first major finding.

1207
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:16,028
只有一半的神父是禁慾的
Only 50% of the clergy are celibate.

1208
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:20,398
現在大多數神父都和其他成人有過性行為
Now, most of them are having sex with other adults.

1209
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:23,338
但這樣子卻創造了一種容忍甚至是保護
But the fact remains that this creates a culture of secrecy

1210
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:26,508
其中的戀童癖者的風氣
that tolerates and even protects pedophiles.

1211
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,338
那麼你覺得教會知道
So you believe the church

1212
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,648
這件事的嚴重程度嗎
is aware of the extent of this, uh, crisis?

1213
01:00:31,648 --> 01:00:32,948
噢 當然
Oh, absolutely.

1214
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:34,918
在路易斯安那州首先爆出醜聞後
After the first major scandal in Louisiana,

1215
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:38,248
教廷大使的秘書兼教律學家和湯姆·多伊爾
tom Doyle, the secretary canonist for the papal nuncio,

1216
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:41,118
共同創作了一份報告 警告戀童癖的神父
co-authored a report warning pedophile priests

1217
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:43,518
若犯了此罪 則要承擔賠償上億美元的法律責任
were a billion-dollar liability.

1218
01:00:43,528 --> 01:00:45,358
那是1985年
That was in 1985.

1219
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:46,788
1985年
1985?

1220
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,428
是的
That's right.

1221
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:51,428
誰看了那份報告 有天主教會的人嗎
Who saw that report? Anyone from the catholic hierarchy?

1222
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:54,598
當然 多伊爾想把這份報告
Sure. Doyle tried to introduce the report

1223
01:00:54,598 --> 01:00:56,968
在天主教全國主教會議上公佈出來
at the national conference of catholic bishops.

1224
01:00:56,968 --> 01:01:00,978
事實上 當時勞主教為這份報告提供了資金
In fact, cardinal law initially helped to fund the report.

1225
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,178
但之後他退縮了 然後他們擱置了此事
But then he backed out and they shelved it.

1226
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:06,708
-他在開玩笑嗎 -理查德 我是羅比
- Is he kidding me? - Uh, Richard, robby here.

1227
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:11,388
我們覺得波士頓有十三個符合此模式的神父
We think we have 13 priests in Boston that fit this pattern,

1228
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:15,218
這會是一個大新聞
which would be a very-- a very big story.

1229
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:19,158
你覺得有這麼多人嗎
Does that sound right to you, uh, in terms of scale?

1230
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:22,858
不 羅比 在我看來是太少了
No, not really, robby. Sounds low to me.

1231
01:01:22,868 --> 01:01:27,198
我估計至少有百分之六對兒童有過性侵行為
My estimates suggest six percent act out sexually with minors.

1232
01:01:27,198 --> 01:01:29,968
百分之六什麼
Uh, six percent of what?

1233
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:32,138
百分之六的神父
Six percent of all priests.

1234
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,138
波士頓有多少神父
How many priests do we have in Boston?

1235
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:36,078
大概一千五百個 百分之一是十五個
About 1,500. One percent is 15.

1236
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,608
百分之六是 九十
Six percent is... 90.

1237
01:01:40,878 --> 01:01:43,178
什麼 九十個神父
Wait. Nine-ninety priests?

1238
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:44,988
這有可能嗎
Is that possible?

1239
01:01:44,988 --> 01:01:48,418
從數量上來看 是的
From a metric standpoint, yes.

1240
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:51,488
那和我的發現是一致的
That would certainly be in line with my findings.

1241
01:01:57,198 --> 01:01:59,328
-喂 -額
- Hello? - Uh--

1242
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:03,168
波士頓有九十個這樣的神父
ninety fucking priests? In Boston?

1243
01:02:03,168 --> 01:02:05,408
他是這麼說的
That's what he said.

1244
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:08,578
如果有九十個這樣的混蛋 人們會知道的
If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.

1245
01:02:08,578 --> 01:02:10,108
也許他們知道
Maybe they do.

1246
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:12,448
但大家都緘默不語嗎
And no one said a thing?

1247
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:14,418
大家都是友好的德國人
Good Germans.

1248
01:02:14,418 --> 01:02:16,678
我想你這話可不能在外說
I don't think that's a comparison you want to make publicly.

1249
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:19,918
麥克利什知道 他只是什麼都沒說
Macleish knew. He just didn't say anything.

1250
01:02:19,918 --> 01:02:21,518
那是十三個神父
That's 13 priests.

1251
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,618
十三和九十之間差別很大的
There's a big difference between 13 and 90.

1252
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:25,428
賽普從哪裏得知的這些數字
Where's this guy sipe getting his numbers?

1253
01:02:25,428 --> 01:02:27,458
他對此研究了三十年
Well, he's been studying it for 30 years.

1254
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,858
-他是一位專業的精神治療醫師 -好的
- He is a trained psychotherapist. - Okay.

1255
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:30,838
但我們不能全都聽信一個
But we need something

1256
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:32,928
以前是神父 還和一個尼姑結婚的嬉皮士
more than a metric from some hippie ex-priest

1257
01:02:32,938 --> 01:02:34,638
我們還需要更多證據
who's shacking up with a nun.

1258
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:38,038
好 那我們就再找些受害者 這樣就能找到更多神父
Okay, so we'll track down more victims. We'll get more priests.

1259
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:40,638
然後我們可以用名錄找到他們
Then we could check them against the directories.

1260
01:02:40,638 --> 01:02:43,638
-受害者這麼多 -我們會找到的
- That's a shitload of victims. - We'll get there.

1261
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:46,108
要多久
How long's it gonna take?

1262
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,048
太久了
Too long.

1263
01:02:48,948 --> 01:02:50,648
等等 會議結束了嗎
Wait. Meeting's over?

1264
01:02:50,648 --> 01:02:52,518
目前是的
Yeah, for now.

1265
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:57,218
-你有什麼辦法 -要是我們反著來呢
- What've you got? - What if we work backwards?

1266
01:02:57,228 --> 01:02:59,258
-什麼意思 反著做什麼 -查名錄
- What do you mean? From what? - From the directories.

1267
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:01,108
我們一直在用名錄確認行為不端的神父
We've been using them to confirm bad priests.

1268
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:02,658
如果我們反著來呢
What if we do it the other way around?

1269
01:03:02,668 --> 01:03:05,168
-用名錄來追查行為不端的神父 -正是
- Use the directories to identify bad priests. - Yeah, exactly.

1270
01:03:05,168 --> 01:03:06,668
我們去找那些說法
We search by designation. We

1271
01:03:06,668 --> 01:03:09,468
找標記著「休病假」或「未分配」的所有神父
look for any priest on "Sick leave" Or "Unassigned."

1272
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:11,808
-或者搬過很多次的神父 -恩
- Or have been moved around a lot. - Yeah.

1273
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:15,508
-那要費很多精力吧 -大家一起干就好了
- It's gonna take a load of work. - Well, not if we're all on it.

1274
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:16,778
你也來嗎
You too?

1275
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:19,648
-通常來說 「大家」肯定包含了我啊 -對 通常來說是這樣
- Generally that's what "All" Means. - Yeah, generally.

1276
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:15,638
圖書館要關門了
Library is closing.

1277
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:20,538
圖書館要關門了
Library is closing.

1278
01:04:29,078 --> 01:04:31,288

01:05:40,058 --> 01:05:42,388
和賽普估計的只差三個 簡直難以置信
That's three off sipe's estimate. That's incredible.

1289
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:43,888
羅比
Robby.

1290
01:05:43,888 --> 01:05:45,328

1291
01:05:45,328 --> 01:05:47,388

Tell him it's important, please.

1297
01:06:04,508 --> 01:06:06,408
請稍等
One moment, please.

1298
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:12,518
嘿 羅比 還好嗎
Hey, robby. Everything okay?

1299
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,758
我要你告訴我一些事情 吉姆
I need you to tell me something, Jim.

1300
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:17,528
-有九十個神父嗎 -什麼
- Could it be 90 priests? - What?

1301
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:19,858
有九十個神父這麼多嗎
Could it be as high as 90?

1302
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,358
天吶 羅比
Jesus, robby.

1303
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,928
我必須得知道 吉姆 如果不重要的話我是不會問的
I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important.

1304
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:28,868
你得收手了 羅比
You gotta stop this, robby.

1305
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:38,518
羅比 麥克利什的助手說
Robby, macleish's assistant

1306
01:06:38,518 --> 01:06:41,018
他時間排滿了 沒法見我們
said he's all booked up. He can't see us.

1307
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:43,278
好吧 去他的
Yeah. Well, the hell he can't.

1308
01:06:48,488 --> 01:06:50,518
好的 這會很有意思的
All right. That'll be fun.

1309

1310
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:58,298

1311
01:06:58,298 --> 01:07:01,168
真的很抱歉 我現在沒時間談話
I'm really sorry. I am. I don't have any time to talk right now--

1312
01:07:01,168 --> 01:07:03,138
麥克利什先生 我們有理由相信
Mr. Macleish, we have reason to believe

1313
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:04,278
波士頓有八十七位神父
that there are allegations

1314
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:06,038
都受過指控
against as many as 87 priests in Boston.

1315
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,808
我不能和你們談這些
I can't talk to you about that.

1316
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:10,738
-這個數字對嗎 -你在開玩笑吧
- Does that number sound right to you? - You gotta be kidding me.

1317
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:12,648
我說過了 我現在沒時間閒扯
I just told you I don't have time for this crap now.

1318
01:07:12,648 --> 01:07:15,648
埃裏克 你調解了多少個神父
Eric, how many priests did you settle?

1319
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:17,648
羅比 你知道我不能告訴你
Robby, you know I can't tell you that.

1320
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:21,058
你得把神父和受害者的名字都給我
You're gonna give me the names and the names of their victims.

1321
01:07:21,058 --> 01:07:22,858
額
Um--

1322
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:24,328
你是在威脅我嗎
are you threatening me?

1323
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:26,488
我們現在有兩條新聞
We've got two stories here.

1324
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:28,658
一條新聞是關於那些可惡的神父
We've got a story about degenerate clergy,

1325
01:07:28,658 --> 01:07:30,758
另一條則是關於一幫律師
and we've got a story about a bunch of lawyers

1326
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:33,268
他們把性侵兒童案當成了家庭手工業
turning child abuse into a cottage industry.

1327
01:07:33,268 --> 01:07:36,368
你想我們報道哪條新聞
Now, which story do you want us to write?

1328
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:37,838
因為我們必須要選一條
'Cause we're writing one of 'em.

1329
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:44,408
我已經給你寄了一份名單
I already sent you a list of names.

1330
01:07:45,378 --> 01:07:47,108
你在說什麼 寄給了誰
What are you talking about? To whom?

1331
01:07:47,118 --> 01:07:49,778
幾年前 寄給了《環球報》
The globe. Years ago.

1332
01:07:49,788 --> 01:07:52,118
波特的案子發生後 我接到了很多電話
After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls.

1333
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,288
光是波士頓就有二十個牽扯其中的神父
I had 20 priests in Boston alone,

1334
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:56,288
但沒有媒體的幫助 我無法調查他們
but I couldn't go after them without the press.

1335
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:59,528
因此我給了你們一份名單
So I sent you guys a list of names,

1336
01:07:59,528 --> 01:08:01,528
你們卻置若罔聞
and you buried it.

1337
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:06,828
-我明天就要這些名字 -去你的剪報裏找吧 羅比
- I want those names tomorrow. - Check your goddamn clips, robby.

1338
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:12,968
-我們在剪報裏什麼也沒找到 -是啊 真讓人吃驚
- We didn't find anything in the clips. - Yeah. Big surprise.

1339
01:08:13,908 --> 01:08:18,048
理查德 額 你還在做彌撒嗎
Richard, uh, do you still go to mass?

1340
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:20,808
不 我已經有一陣子沒去教堂了
No. No, I haven't been to church for some time now.

1341
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:23,448
但我還是個天主教徒
But I still consider myself a catholic.

1342
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:25,248
這怎麼行得通呢
H-how does that work?

1343
01:08:25,248 --> 01:08:29,488
教會是一個由人組成的機構 麥克
Well, the church is an institution, Mike, made of men.

1344
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,388
它是短暫的
It's passing.

1345
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:34,128
但我的信仰是永恆的
My faith is in the eternal.

1346
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:36,328
我試著把兩者區分開來
I try to separate the two.

1347
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:38,968
-聽起來很難 -的確
- Sounds tricky. - It is.

1348
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:42,168
特別是教會還在對我窮追猛打
Especially since the church continues to go after me.

1349
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,138
代價很大的 麥克
It takes a toll, Mike.

1350
01:08:44,138 --> 01:08:46,238
他們想要鎮壓所有站出來說話的人
They'll try to silence anyone who speaks out.

1351
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,808
我想他們很快就會找上你和你的團隊
I'm sure they'll come after you and your team soon enough.

1352
01:08:48,808 --> 01:08:51,248
真的嗎 那你覺得他們會怎麼做
Really. And how do you think they'd do that?

1353
01:08:54,818 --> 01:08:56,448
喂
Hello?

1354
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:57,918
理查德
Richard?

1355
01:09:04,028 --> 01:09:05,458
誰啊
Who is it?

1356
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,528
坎特伯雷大主教
It's the archbishop of canterbury.

1357
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:13,328
我在披薩店吃了晚飯 剩了一些
I had dinner at santarpio's. Had some leftovers.

1358
01:09:13,338 --> 01:09:16,038
啊 你太棒了 謝啦
Ah, you're the freakin' best. Thanks.

1359
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:18,368
-要喝酒嗎 -要
- You want a beer? - Yeah.

1360
01:09:18,368 --> 01:09:19,968
好的
You got it.

1361
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:23,608
天吶 你還要在這個鬼地方住多久
Jesus. How much longer you gonna be in this shithole?

1362
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:25,648
還在想呢
Yeah. I'm working on it.

1363
01:09:25,648 --> 01:09:27,378
她是個好女孩 麥克
She's a good girl, Mike.

1364
01:09:27,378 --> 01:09:30,448
是的 我們會解決的
Yeah, she is. We'll figure it out.

1365
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,888
我最近沒什麼時間
I haven't had a lot of time lately.

1366
01:09:32,888 --> 01:09:34,888
其實我剛剛才和賽普通完電話
I just got off the phone with sipe, actually.

1367
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:37,218
你親眼見過這個人嗎
Have you met this guy in person yet?

1368
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:41,128
沒有 不過他對此事的瞭解明顯跟我們不在一個層次
No, but his knowledge of this is on a whole other level.

1369
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:42,798
我要餓死了
I'm frickin' starving.

1370
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:46,828
九十個神父的事查得怎麼樣了
So, where are we with the 90?

1371
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:48,368
快了
We're close.

1372
01:09:48,368 --> 01:09:50,368
-多快 -就是快了
- How close? - We're close.

1373
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:52,138
直接回答問題 好嗎
Just answer the question, will you?

1374
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,578
我們查到了八十七個
We got 87 names.

1375
01:09:57,578 --> 01:09:59,748
正在努力確認 我們會查清楚的
We're trying to get confirmation. I think we will.

1376
01:10:01,718 --> 01:10:04,418
你在心煩什麼
Something bugging you?

1377
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:07,248
我只是很驚訝
It's just surprising, that's all.

1378
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:10,058
恩 是啊
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1379
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:11,788
大家都是
For everybody.

1380
01:10:15,898 --> 01:10:19,228
等等 本 我忘了問你
Wait, Ben. I forgot to ask you.

1381
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:20,488
菲爾·薩維亞諾說
Phil saviano said he sent

1382
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:22,698
幾年前他給《環球報》寄了一些資料
a bunch of info over to the globe years ago.

1383
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:25,708
-你知道寄給誰了嗎 -不知道 怎麼了
- Do you have any idea to who? - No. Why?

1384
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,178
我好奇罷了 我想知道
I'm just curious. I wanted to

1385
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:29,678
你們有沒有漏掉什麼線索
see if there's any leads you guys didn't run out.

1386
01:10:29,678 --> 01:10:30,988
薩維亞諾五年前是個
Saviano was a fucking train

1387
01:10:30,988 --> 01:10:33,208
操蛋的麻煩鬼 我們沒有漏了什麼
wreck five years ago. We didn't miss anything.

1388
01:10:33,218 --> 01:10:35,148
這件事得有聚焦的追查
This story needed spotlight.

1389
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:38,688
對 我同意 我只是在跟蹤調查
Yeah, I agree. I'm just following up.

1390
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:43,458
-晚安 -嗯 晚安
- Good night. - Yeah, good night.

1391
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:50,628
難以置信 你什麼時候搞到這個的
This is unbelievable. When did you get this?

1392
01:10:50,628 --> 01:10:52,698
麥克利什今天早上發郵件給我的
Macleish e-mailed the list this morning.

1393
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:55,398
他處理了涉及四十五個神父的案件
He settled cases against 45 priests.

1394
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:57,808
我們追查勞的事怎麼樣了
Where are we on Law?

1395
01:10:57,808 --> 01:10:59,968
有線索顯示他知道這件事嗎
Anything that shows he had knowledge of this?

1396
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,308
我們還在對付加拉貝迪安 但沒有具體消息
We're still working garabedian. But nothing concrete.

1397
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:04,978
我一直在想我們那天晚上的對話
I keep thinking about that conversation we had the other night

1398
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:07,748
關於在我們報道波特案的時候
about how Law called down the power of god

1399
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:09,818
勞是如何借用神的力量的
when we reported on Porter.

1400
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:12,318
那就是勞的本性
That's just Law being Law.

1401
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:14,608
好吧 但我查了剪報
Okay. But I checked the clips, and,

1402
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:17,758
呃 波特甚至都不在波士頓教區
uh, Porter isn't even in the Boston archdiocese.

1403
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:22,228
他來自福爾裏弗市 所以 為什麼反應這麼激烈
He's from fall river. So... why the extreme reaction?

1404
01:11:23,498 --> 01:11:25,668
勞肯定知道
Law had to know.

1405
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:27,668
所以他的反應才這麼激烈
That's why he had the reaction.

1406
01:11:27,668 --> 01:11:29,738
因為他知道還有其他人
Because he knew there were others.

1407
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,738
我覺得這就是我要的更重要的故事
I think that's the bigger story.

1408
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:37,738
等等 比五十個神父還重要嗎
Wait. Bigger than 50 priests?

1409
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:40,508
如果它是至上而下的操作 是的
If it came from the top down, yes.

1410
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:41,678
但這數字明顯
But the numbers clearly

1411
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:44,118
暗示了還有更高級的神職人員牽扯進去
indicate that there were senior clergy involved.

1412
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:45,848
但是現在這些也只能是暗示
That's all they do-- indicate.

1413
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:47,088
你是說如果我們
Are you telling me that if we

1414
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:49,188
發表波士頓有五十個戀童癖神父的報道
run a story with 50 pedophile priests in Boston--

1415
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:50,458
麥克
Mike.

1416
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:53,028
我們就會陷入跟你報道波特案後一樣的激烈爭論
We'll get into the same catfight you got into on Porter,

1417
01:11:53,028 --> 01:11:57,158
除了製造噪音之外完全沒有改變任何事情
which made a lot of noise but changed things not one bit.

1418
01:12:00,038 --> 01:12:03,668
我們得把注意力集中在教會機構 而不是個別神父
We need to focus on the institution, not the individual priests.

1419
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,868
慣例跟政策
Practice and policy.

1420
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,668
你們得讓我看到教會操縱了司法體系
Show me the church manipulated the system

1421
01:12:07,678 --> 01:12:09,978
所以這些傢伙才得以逃脫指控
so that these guys wouldn't have to face charges.

1422
01:12:09,978 --> 01:12:12,208
要讓我看到他們一次又一次地
Show me they put those same priests back into parishes

1423
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,848
把同一批神父塞回教區
time and time again.

1424
01:12:13,848 --> 01:12:17,678
讓我看到這是一個體系的 從上而下的
Show me this was systemic, that it came from the top down.

1425
01:12:19,448 --> 01:12:21,788
聽起來我們是要對付勞啊
Sounds like we're going after law.

1426
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:27,728
我們是要追查這個體系
We're going after the system.

1427
01:12:30,298 --> 01:12:33,328
列一張我們目前掌握的所有受害人的清單 開始行動吧
Make a list of all the victims we have. Start reaching out.

1428
01:12:33,338 --> 01:12:35,398
-如果需要幫助可以把馬特請來 -嗯哼 好的
- And bring Matt in if you need help. - Mm-hmm. Okay.

1429
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:38,238
-嘿 你什麼時候去斯普林菲爾德 -我們的聽證會是在週一
- Hey, when do you go to Springfield? - Our hearing is Monday.

1430
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:39,508
好的
Okay.

1431
01:12:39,508 --> 01:12:41,478
喂 羅比 你有時間嗎
Hey, robby, you got a second?

1432
01:12:41,478 --> 01:12:43,338
有的
Yeah.

1433
01:12:43,348 --> 01:12:45,068
我 離我家一個街區的地方
I, uh-- I got one of those

1434
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:47,708
有個治療中心
treatment centers a block from my house.

1435
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:51,218
周圍的鄰居都有小孩
We got neighbors with kids.

1436
01:12:51,218 --> 01:12:53,248
我知道我們的工作是機密
I know that the work we do is confidential,

1437
01:12:53,258 --> 01:12:56,918
但我覺得 我應該告訴他們
but I'm feeling like... I should tell 'em.

1438
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,658
我們很快就會告訴他們了
We'll tell 'em soon.

1439
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:05,668
你確定
You sure?

1440
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:07,328
-對 -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

我是《波士頓環球報》的薩夏·法伊弗
I'm sacha pfeiffer from the Boston globe.

1447
01:13:34,628 --> 01:13:37,028
-哦 你有什麼事 -我想跟托馬斯·肯尼迪談談
- Yeah, what do you want? - I'd like to speak with Thomas Kennedy.

1448
01:13:37,028 --> 01:13:39,898
-他已經不住這裏了 -那你知道他住哪嗎
- He doesn't live here anymore. - Do you know where he lives?

1449
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:42,038
先生 我只是想問幾個
Sir, I'd just like to ask a few--

1450
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:45,568
我是薩夏·法伊弗 《波士頓環球報》的
sacha pfeiffer, Boston globe.

1451
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,808
-噢 是 你好 -你好 謝謝
- Oh, yeah. Hi. - Hi. Thank you.

1452
01:13:48,808 --> 01:13:51,978
-你還能想到什麼其他事嗎 -沒了
- Anything else you can recall? - No.

1453
01:13:51,978 --> 01:13:53,978
想不起了 不過我有個堂姐在昆西
No, but I got a cousin in Quincy.

1454
01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:55,878
她幾年後在街上見過他
She saw him in the street a few years later.

1455
01:13:56,878 --> 01:13:58,318
主教走進了房子
The bishop came to the house.

1456
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:00,418
他說之前從沒發生過這樣的事情
He said nothing like this had ever happened before.

1457
01:14:00,418 --> 01:14:02,328
他叫我們不要起訴
He asked us not to press charges.

1458
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:03,958
那你母親是怎麼做的
And what did your mother do?

1459
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,488
我母親
My mother?

1460
01:14:06,498 --> 01:14:08,558
她居然還拿出了餅乾招待
She put out freakin' cookies.

1461
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,938
當時有很大的壓力讓我們保持沉默
There was a lot of pressure to keep quiet.

1462
01:14:14,938 --> 01:14:17,898
-來自教會的壓力嗎 -對 來自教會的
- From the church? - Yeah, from the church.

1463
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:19,908
但不只是教會
But not just the church.

1464
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:22,638
還有我的朋友
From my friends.

1465
01:14:22,648 --> 01:14:24,308
其他的教區居民
From the other parishioners.

1466
01:14:24,308 --> 01:14:27,408
嗯 我治療的很多神父
Well, many of the priests that I treated

1467
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:28,978
都是性心理發育不良
were psychosexually stunted.

1468
01:14:28,978 --> 01:14:31,318
情感方面還停留在十二三歲的水平
On the emotional level of a 12- or 13-year-old.

1469
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:32,918
天啊
Jesus.

1470
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:34,858
首領主教當然知道 每個人都知道
Sure the chief knew. Everybody knew.

1471
01:14:34,858 --> 01:14:36,688
但沒有人想給神父戴上手銬
But nobody wants to cuff a priest.

1472
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:40,588
嗯 那公訴人呢
Mmm. And what about the prosecutor?

1473
01:14:40,598 --> 01:14:44,428
-我不該談這件破事 -其實我覺得你應該
- I shouldn't talk about this shit. - I think you should, actually.

1474
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:47,368
你認識赫爾利神父或者蓋爾神父嗎
Do you know a father Hurley or a father Gale?

1475
01:14:47,368 --> 01:14:48,538
認識
I do.

1476
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:50,638
-我會把你打得屁滾尿流 -抱歉打擾你了
- I'll beat the shit out of you. - Sorry to bother you.

1477
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:51,778
你不要再來了 不要再來
You leave me alone. You leave

1478
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:53,438
打擾我兄弟 聽到了嗎 該死的
my brother alone. You hear me? Goddamn it.

1479
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:04,548
你好 我找羅納德·帕奎因
Hi there. I'm looking for Ronald paquin.

1480
01:15:04,548 --> 01:15:06,218

Yes?

1481
01:15:06,218 --> 01:15:08,958
-你就是帕奎因神父嗎 -是的 沒錯
- You're father paquin? - Yes. That's right.

1482
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:12,728
我是《波士頓環球報》的薩夏·法伊弗 我
I'm sacha pfeiffer from the Boston globe. I--

1483
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:14,558
-好的 -我能問你幾個問題嗎
- okay. - Could I ask you a few questions?

1484
01:15:14,558 --> 01:15:16,998
問吧 親愛的
Go ahead, dear.

1485
01:15:16,998 --> 01:15:19,198
我們跟幾個小時候在黑弗裏爾的聖約翰浸信會
We spoke to several men who knew you when they were boys

1486
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:21,498
就認識你的人談過
at St. John the baptist in haverhill.

1487
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:25,108
他們說你曾性騷擾過他們 這是真的嗎
Did-- they told us you molested them. Is that true?

1488
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:29,638
嗯 當然 我胡鬧過
Mmm, sure, I fooled around.

1489
01:15:29,648 --> 01:15:31,548
但我自己從未感到開心過
But I never felt gratified myself.

1490
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,408
這樣 嗯
Right. Um--

1491
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:38,148
但你承認在聖約翰浸信會性騷擾過男孩子們
but you admit to molesting boys at St. John the baptist?

1492
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:42,258
對對 但就像我說的 我從來沒得到過任何快感
Yes, yes, but as I said, I never got any pleasure from it.

1493
01:15:42,258 --> 01:15:44,558
瞭解這一點是很重要的
That's important to understand.

1494
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:46,088
好的
Right.

1495
01:15:46,098 --> 01:15:48,028
嗯 但你能告訴我
Um, but can you tell me

1496
01:15:48,028 --> 01:15:50,398
你是在哪裏 又是怎麼玩弄那些男孩子的
where and how you fooled around with these boys?

1497
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:55,898
我要說清楚一點 我從來沒有強暴過任何人
I want to be clear. I never raped anyone.

1498
01:15:56,838 --> 01:15:59,108
這是不一樣的 我是知道的
There's a difference. I should know.

1499
01:15:59,108 --> 01:16:02,178
-你怎麼知道的 -我就被強暴過
- How would you know? - I was raped.

1500
01:16:04,748 --> 01:16:07,078
我很抱歉 是誰強暴了你
I'm sorry. Who raped you?

1501
01:16:07,078 --> 01:16:08,848
-羅尼 你在跟誰講話 -沒事的 簡
- Ronny, who are you talking to? - It's okay, Jane.

1502
01:16:08,848 --> 01:16:10,348
-帕奎因神父 誰強暴了你 -你是誰
- Father paquin, who raped you? - Who are you?

1503
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:12,588
呃 我是薩夏·法伊弗 《環球報》的
Uh, sacha pfeiffer, from the globe.

1504
01:16:12,588 --> 01:16:14,918
-請離開我的走廊 -我能自己說話
- Please get off my porch. - I can speak for myself.

1505

1507
01:16:18,788 --> 01:16:21,128
-抱歉 您是 -我是他妹妹
- I'm sorry. Who are you? - I'm his sister.

1508
01:16:21,128 --> 01:16:24,028
-並且我希望你不要再回來這裏了 -帕奎因小姐
- And I don't want you coming back here. - Miss paquin--

1509
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:32,968
我會在街尾超過你的
beat you to the end of the street.

1510
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:34,978
-不可能 -我上次就超過你了
- No, you won't. - I beat you last time.

1511
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:38,038
才沒有 你作弊了
No, you didn't. You cheated. You did.

1512
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:47,748
能請你為我闡明一下《環球報》的態度嗎 阿爾巴諾先生
Could you please clarify the globe's position for me, Mr. Albano?

1513
01:16:47,758 --> 01:16:49,558
好的 斯威尼法官
Yes, judge sweeney.

1514
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:56,098
我們關於公開這些文件的論證
Our argument to make these documents public

1515
01:16:56,098 --> 01:16:58,498
主要是基於第一修正案的
rests mainly on first amendment grounds.

1516
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:01,598
我們還有一些其他相關的論證
We also have a number of other relevant arguments.

1517
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,168
法官閣下 畢竟這是個自由裁量指令
After all, your honor, this was a discretionary order.

1518
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,938
是的 它取決於法官的裁量
Yes. It was made at the judge's discretion.

1519
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:08,508
嘿 麥克
Hey, Mike.

1520
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:10,508
嗨 喬
Hey, Joe.

1521
01:17:10,508 --> 01:17:13,148
聚焦的記者來到斯普林菲爾德做什麼
What's a spotlight reporter doing in Springfield?

1522
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:17,818
你的阿爾巴諾正在逆水行舟
Your boy albano's sledding uphill.

1523
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:20,018
你真的覺得你們有機會贏這場官司嗎
You actually think you have a shot at winning this thing?

1524
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,088
你想讓我對《先驅報》發表評論嗎
You want me to comment for the herald?

1525
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,958
「環球報記者不予置評
"Globe reporter would not comment,

1526
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,658
但他看起來不抱希望」
but he did not seem hopeful."

1527
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:32,968
他完全不試圖隱瞞
He didn't try and hide it at all.

1528
01:17:32,968 --> 01:17:35,868
他有相當奇怪的合理化說法
He had this really odd rationalization for it,

1529
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:39,538
好像玩弄小男孩是完全正常的事情
like it was totally normal to fool around with little boys.

1530
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:42,478
我真的很想回去 我覺得他會願意跟我們談談
I'd really like to go back. I think he'd talk to us.

1531
01:17:42,478 --> 01:17:44,538
噢 我們會的
Oh, we will.

1532
01:17:44,548 --> 01:17:46,208
只是時機未到
Just not yet.

1533
01:17:46,218 --> 01:17:48,718
我希望你現在繼續重點關注受害者們
I want you to stay focused on the victims right now.

1534
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:51,178
薩夏 他們把塔爾伯特神父送到哪了
Sacha, where'd they send father Talbot again?

1535
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:53,448
呃 好像是 捨沃羅斯
Um, I think-- wasn't that cheverus?

1536
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,558
捨沃羅斯 沒錯 等等
Cheverus. That's right. Wait.

1537
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:57,558
塔爾伯特是波士頓天主教高中的嗎
Father Talbot from bc high?

1538
01:17:57,558 --> 01:17:59,828
對 你認識他嗎
Yeah. You know him?

1539
01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:02,498
嗯 我們是同一時期讀的中學
Yeah. He was there when I was.

1540
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:05,968
-是受害者嗎 -對 住在普羅維登斯
- We have a victim? - Yeah. Lives in Providence.

1541
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:12,368
這些文件都無關個人 法官閣下
There's nothing personal in these documents, your honor.

1542
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:14,068
他們是關於紅衣主教怎麼處理
They concern how the cardinal is handling--

1543
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:16,538
請說「總教區」
say "The archdiocese."

1544
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:18,008
什麼
Excuse me?

1545
01:18:18,008 --> 01:18:21,248
你不能把所有事都歸為紅衣主教的所為 阿爾巴諾先生
You don't get to tag the cardinal with everything, Mr. Albano.

1546
01:18:21,248 --> 01:18:23,718
請說「總教區」
Say "The archdiocese."

1547
01:18:23,718 --> 01:18:25,118
斯威尼法官 《環球報》不是
Judge sweeney, the globe is not a

1548
01:18:25,128 --> 01:18:27,248
本案相關的任何一方 他們只是想增加銷量罷了
party to this case. They just want to sell papers.

1549
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:30,758
如果加拉貝迪安先生沒有詆毀主教的清名
If Mr. Garabedian had not smeared the cardinal's good name,

1550
01:18:30,758 --> 01:18:32,328
我們也不會在這裏了
we wouldn't even be here.

1551
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:35,098
法官閣下 我反對使用「詆毀」這個詞
Your honor, I object to the use of the word "Smear."

1552
01:18:35,098 --> 01:18:37,828
-已悉 加拉貝迪安先生 -謝謝 法官閣下
- Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian. - Thank you, your honor.

1553
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:40,168
-還有嗎 羅傑斯先生 -沒了 法官閣下
- Anything else, Mr. Rogers? - No, your honor.

1554
01:18:40,168 --> 01:18:41,938
阿爾巴諾先生 您請繼續
Mr. Albano, you may continue.

1555
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:43,438
《環球報》認為
The globe believes having--

1556
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:48,008
喂 米奇 最近好嗎
hey, Mitch, how you doing?

1557
01:18:48,008 --> 01:18:50,078
挺好的
I'm fine.

1558
01:18:50,078 --> 01:18:52,948
他挺難搞的啊 那個威爾遜·羅傑斯
He's tough, that Wilson Rogers.

1559
01:18:52,948 --> 01:18:56,018
他太自以為是 還很馬虎
He's smug. And he's sloppy.

1560
01:18:56,018 --> 01:18:58,448
看起來不馬虎啊
He doesn't seem sloppy.

1561
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:01,588
你沒有我知道的多 相信我
You don't know the half of it. Trust me.

1562
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:03,188
你還知道什麼
What's the half of it?

1563
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:07,528
告訴我啊 米奇
Tell me the half of it, Mitch.

1564
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:11,198
-私底下講嗎 -對 偷偷告訴我
- Off the record? - Off the record, yeah.

1565
01:19:14,468 --> 01:19:17,068
三年前 我接到一個前神父的電話
Three years ago, I get a call from an ex-priest.

1566
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:18,468
安東尼·本澤維奇
Anthony benzevich.

1567
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:20,868
他在62年的聖餐禮上
He was at blessed sacrament back in '62,

1568
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:22,608
看到吉歐根
and he saw geoghan...

1569
01:19:24,308 --> 01:19:26,608
把小男孩們帶進管區臥室
Taking little boys up to the rectory bedroom, okay?

1570
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:30,478
他覺得很震驚 然後就告訴了主教
So he's appalled, all right? Tells the bishop about it.

1571
01:19:30,488 --> 01:19:34,318
然後主教威脅要把他派到南美
And the bishop threatens to reassign him to south America.

1572
01:19:34,318 --> 01:19:35,988
-老天 -對 沒錯
- Jesus. - Yeah, all right.

1573
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:38,328
所以快進三十五年 本澤維奇在報上看到
So fast-forward 35 years, benzevich reads

1574
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:41,428
吉歐根被指控對數百個孩子進行過性騷擾
that geoghan has been charged with molesting hundreds of kids.

1575
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:43,498
然後他感到內疚 給我打了電話
All right? So he feels guilty. He calls me.

1576
01:19:43,498 --> 01:19:45,728
所以你手裏有一份神父
So you have testimony of a priest

1577
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:48,168
在62年向他上級舉報吉歐根的證詞嗎
telling his superiors about geoghan in '62?

1578
01:19:48,168 --> 01:19:50,438
不 我沒有
No, I do not.

1579
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:53,068
因為我讓本澤維奇來做宣誓證詞的時候
Because when I called benzevich in to give a deposition,

1580
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:55,178
他帶了個律師過來
he comes in with a lawyer.

1581
01:19:55,178 --> 01:19:57,308
-威爾遜·羅傑斯 -對
- Wilson Rogers. - Right.

1582
01:19:57,308 --> 01:19:59,978
然後本澤維奇神父就突然變得記憶模糊了
And suddenly father benzevich has a very foggy memory.

1583
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:02,178
什麼也不記得了 沒用了
Can't remember anything. He's useless.

1584
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:05,248
所以我就回去工作 忘了這件事
So I go back to work. I forget about it. Whatever.

1585
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:07,318
直到一年前 我找到一篇文章
Until about a year ago, I find an article

1586
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:10,458
是講有一個神父警告教會注意吉歐根的事
about a priest who warned church officials about geoghan.

1587
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,828
-本澤維奇去找了媒體嗎 -對
- Benzevich went to the press? - Yeah.

1588
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:15,628
對 當地報紙 叫做《愛國者紀事報》 沒人看到
Yeah. Local paper, patriot ledger. Nobody saw it.

1589
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:17,528
但我有本澤維奇的公開聲明了
But now I got benzevich on record.

1590
01:20:17,528 --> 01:20:21,628
所以我提出動議讓本澤維奇再次宣誓作證
So I file a motion to depose benzevich a second time. All right?

1591
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:24,668
然後威爾遜·羅傑斯 那個自以為是的王八蛋
And Wilson Rogers, that smug son of a bitch,

1592
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:27,868
他提了個動議來反對我的動議
he files a motion opposing my motion.

1593
01:20:27,878 --> 01:20:29,508
就是那時候我抓住了他的把柄
And that's when I have him.

1594
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:32,008
把柄 什麼把柄
Have-- have him how?

1595
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:35,618
羅傑斯反對我的動議 所以我得做個論證
Rogers opposes my motion, so I have to make an argument

1596
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:36,698
證明為什麼要允許
as to why I'm allowed to

1597
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,688
我再次請本澤維奇神父作證
depose father benzevich a second time, okay?

1598
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:41,888
但是這次 我可以附加上一些證據
But this time, I'm allowed to attach exhibits.

1599
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:43,488
你明白我在說什麼嗎
Do you follow what I'm saying?

1600
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:45,058
-附加上那些密封文件嗎 -對
- The sealed documents? - Yes.

1601
01:20:45,058 --> 01:20:47,288
我可以附上
I can attach the sealed documents

1602
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:49,558
我發現的密封文件 雷贊德斯先生
that I've gotten in discovery, Mr. Rezendes,

1603
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:53,228
就是你們報社現在在找的那些文件
the same documents that your paper is currently suing for.

1604
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:54,668
你在唬我
You're shitting me.

1605
01:20:54,668 --> 01:20:56,968
什麼 不不 我沒騙你
What? No. No, I'm not shitting you.

1606
01:20:56,968 --> 01:20:59,408
所以我調出十四份最確鑿的文件
So I pull out the 14 most damning docs

1607
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:01,238
把它們附加到我的動議裏
and I attach them to my motion.

1608
01:21:01,238 --> 01:21:03,238
這樣就能證明了一切 一切
And they prove everything. Everything.

1609
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:05,808
關於教會 關於主教 關於勞
About the church, about the bishops, about Law.

1610
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:07,578
而這是全部公開的嗎
And it's all public?

1611
01:21:07,578 --> 01:21:09,848
因為你反對羅傑動議的動議
Because your motion to oppose Roger's motion--

1612
01:21:09,848 --> 01:21:10,818
是公開的
is public.

1613
01:21:10,818 --> 01:21:13,748
對 就是這樣 現在你終於注意到了
Yeah. Exactly. Now you're paying attention.

1614
01:21:13,758 --> 01:21:14,958
所以我現在能直接走進法院
So I could just walk into that

1615
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,758
拿到那些文件嗎
courthouse right now and get those documents?

1616
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:20,528
不 不行 因為那些文件不在法院
No, you cannot, because the documents are not there.

1617
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:22,428
但你剛才說它們是公開的
But you just said they're public.

1618
01:21:22,428 --> 01:21:25,598
我是說過 但這裏是波士頓
I know I did. But this is Boston.

1619
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:28,268
而教會並不希望有人找到它們
And the church does not want them to be found.

1620
01:21:28,268 --> 01:21:31,268
所以它們不在那裏
So they are not there.

1621
01:21:32,608 --> 01:21:35,538
米奇 你是說天主教會
Mitch, are you telling me that the catholic church

1622
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:37,778
能從法院移走法律文件嗎
removed legal documents from that courthouse?

1623
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:41,208
聽著 我沒瘋 也沒得妄想癥
Look, I'm not crazy. I'm not paranoid.

1624
01:21:41,218 --> 01:21:42,948
我是有處世經驗的人
I'm experienced.

1625
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:45,788
查查檔案記事表 你就明白了
Check the docket. You'll see.

1626
01:21:45,788 --> 01:21:47,518
他們什麼都能操縱
They control everything.

1627
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,758
什麼都能
Everything.

1628
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,458
我得回去了
I gotta go back in.

1629
01:21:58,628 --> 01:22:01,268
我得趕緊去拿那些該死的文件
I just got the fucking documents.

1630
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:18,648
訴訟事件表流水號49 吉歐根案
Docket entry number 49, in the geoghan case.

1631
01:22:18,648 --> 01:22:20,818
-好的 謝謝 -我們十分鐘後關門
- Okay, thanks. - We close in 10 minutes.

1632
01:22:20,818 --> 01:22:22,358
十分鐘 好的
Ten minutes? All right.

1633
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,958
羅比
Robby.

1634
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,528
嘿 你絕對不會相信
Hey. You're not gonna believe it.

1635
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,598
加拉貝迪安給了我一個提示
Garabedian gave me a tip.

1636
01:23:04,598 --> 01:23:06,608
有一些密封文件已經公開了
Some of the sealed docs are already public.

1637
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:08,198
它們是他申請的動議的一部分
They're part of a motion he filed.

1638
01:23:08,198 --> 01:23:09,698
他說它們是文件中的精華
He said they're the best of the bunch.

1639
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,698
我們不必等斯威尼的裁決了
We don't have to wait for sweeney's ruling.

1640
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,268
-所以我們能搞到它們嗎 -對 但它們不在那裏
- So we can get them? - Yeah, but they're not there.

1641
01:23:14,278 --> 01:23:15,498
已經跟阿爾巴諾談過了
Already talked to albano.

1642
01:23:15,498 --> 01:23:17,608
他說我們要做的就是提出動議
He said all we have to do is file a motion,

1643
01:23:17,608 --> 01:23:20,178
斯威尼就會讓米奇重新歸檔那些文件
and sweeney will order Mitch to refile the docs.

1644
01:23:20,178 --> 01:23:21,948
你覺得那些文件是
And you think these documents are--

1645
01:23:21,948 --> 01:23:24,878
他說那十四份文件正是我們需要的 非常重要
he said these 14 docs are all we need. They're huge.

1646
01:23:24,888 --> 01:23:26,548
好吧
Okay.

1647
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:29,418
我會打給本 做得很好
I'll call Ben. Good work.

1648
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:47,308
這是純粹的意外
Is this purely an accident

1649
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:49,038
還是有意的行為
or could this have been an intentional act?

1650
01:23:49,038 --> 01:23:52,748
無論如何 這座建築都受到了重大的損壞
Either way, extensive damage has been done to this building.

1651
01:23:54,748 --> 01:23:56,348
怎麼回事
What happened?

1652
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:59,918
他們說是一架支持機 但那根本不是
They're saying it's a prop plane, but that's not a prop plane.

1653
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:06,828
叫琳達馬上把在這兒的所有記者都召集過來
Tell Linda to get every reporter we have in here now.

1654
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:09,928
我們要為受害者祈禱
You pray for the victims.

1655
01:24:10,728 --> 01:24:12,928
要為傷者祈禱

要為倖存者祈禱

01:24:17,068 --> 01:24:20,068
還要為這個國家祈禱
You pray, too, for the nation.

1658
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,608
希望我們對此的回應
That our response to this

1659
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:28,548
能反映出我國最崇高的理想
might reflect the best ideals of our nation.

1660
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:31,948
甚至能反映出上帝的教義
And even more, reflect god's own teaching,

1661
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:36,288
不僅表現在基督教和猶太教
not only as it's shown in christianity and judaism

1662
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:38,558
還有伊斯蘭教

01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:26,338
很快就好 你重新歸檔那些文件了嗎
Hey, just quickly. Did you refile those docs yet?

1686
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:28,438
沒有 我剛接到傳令 還需要點時間
No. I just got the order. It takes time.

1687
01:25:28,438 --> 01:25:30,838
-好的 很好 你能拖延一下歸檔時間嗎 -為什麼
- Okay, great. Can you hold off on refiling them? - Hold off?

1688
01:25:30,848 --> 01:25:33,508
我得去一趟佛羅里達 你一歸檔它們就公開了
I have to go to Florida. Once you refile they're public.

1689
01:25:33,518 --> 01:25:35,518
其他報紙也能得到它們
Other newspapers will be able to get a hold of 'em.

1690
01:25:35,518 --> 01:25:37,578
其他報紙什麼的我不關心
Other newspapers are not my concern.

1691
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:39,518
我收到了裁決令
I received a judicial order.

1692
01:25:39,518 --> 01:25:41,518
我跟你說了教會正盯著我
I told you the church is watching me.

1693
01:25:41,518 --> 01:25:44,488
喂 米奇 拜託你 我只需要幾周時間
Hey, Mitch, please. All I need is a few more weeks.

1694
01:25:45,488 --> 01:25:47,658
我不敢保證 再見
I can't make any promises. Good-bye.

1695
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:50,428
米奇 米奇 媽的
Mitch! Mitch! Shit!

1696
01:25:51,868 --> 01:25:53,168
靠
Shit.

1697
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:03,208
聽著 我算是明白了
Look, I get it.

1698
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,358
沒人想看到關於
No one wants to read about

1699
01:26:04,358 --> 01:26:06,378
兒童被神父強暴的新聞 尤其是現在
kids getting raped by priests, especially now.

1700
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:07,948
但你讓那麼多人
But you asked a lot of people

1701
01:26:07,948 --> 01:26:10,718
回憶了一些非常痛苦的經歷 然後就消失了
to relive some very painful experiences, and you just disappear.

1702
01:26:10,718 --> 01:26:12,618
菲爾 你知道我們為什麼得暫停這個報道
Phil, you know why we were taken off of this story.

1703
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:14,048
九·一一都過去六個星期了
It's been six weeks since 9/11.

1704
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:16,388
我知道 我們會重新追蹤這件事的
I realize that, and we're gonna get back to it.

1705
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,888
什麼時候
When?

1706
01:26:19,228 --> 01:26:21,688
-你們還是會跟上次一樣 -不是的
- You're doing the same thing you guys did last time. - No.

1707
01:26:21,698 --> 01:26:23,058
-你們準備放棄了 -不會的
- You're dropping us. - No.

1708
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,898
也許我該把這件事告訴《先驅報》
Maybe I should tell the herald that story.

1709
01:26:25,898 --> 01:26:28,738
好吧 菲爾 你去吧
Okay, Phil, you go ahead and do that.

1710
01:26:28,738 --> 01:26:32,038
這樣我們目前的成果全都會付之一炬 但我阻止不了你
It'll undo all the work we've done, but I can't stop you.

1711
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:38,038
聽我說 我會來這裏是因為我在乎
Listen to me. I am here because I care.

1712
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,648
我們不會放棄的
We're not going away.

1713
01:26:41,648 --> 01:26:44,018
我們會不偏不倚地 把這件事公諸於眾
We're gonna tell this story. We're gonna tell it right.

1714
01:26:44,018 --> 01:26:46,748
我們只是還需要一點時間 這是我們全部的請求
We just need a little more time. That's all we're asking for.

1715
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:51,758
何必請求呢
Why bother asking?

1716
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:55,598
不管怎樣你們都會想幹什麼就幹什麼
You're gonna do what you want anyway.

1717
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:57,428
你們總是這樣
You always do.

1718
01:26:57,428 --> 01:26:58,998
菲爾
Phil.

1719
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,428
菲爾
Phil!

1720
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:09,778
喂
Hey.

1721
01:27:09,778 --> 01:27:12,548
-南海灘怎麼樣 -是博因頓海灘 非常不同的地方
- How's South Beach? - Boynton beach. Remarkably different place.

1722
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:14,108
怎麼了
What's up?

1723
01:27:14,118 --> 01:27:16,278
米奇·加拉貝迪安今天聯繫我了
Mitch garabedian called me today.

1724
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,888
-他為什麼打給你 -因為知道你會吼他
- Why'd he call you? - 'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.

1725
01:27:18,888 --> 01:27:21,788
-他重新歸檔了那些文件 -什麼
- He refiled the docs. - What?

1726
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:23,618
羅比 那些文件現在是公開的了
Robby, those docs are public now.

1727
01:27:23,628 --> 01:27:25,558
我們得在別人之前趕過去
We gotta get there before anyone else does.

1728
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:26,588
我知道 我知道 我知道
I know. I know. I know.

1729
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,698
趕緊把手頭上的事結束掉 去趕最早的航班
Just wrap up whatever you're doing and get the first flight out.

1730
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:30,438
我現在就訂票
I'll book a flight now

1731
01:27:30,438 --> 01:27:31,898
明天直接去法院
and go straight to the courthouse tomorrow.

1732
01:27:31,898 --> 01:27:33,968
-好的 進去之後通知我 -好的
- All right. Call me when you get in. - Okay.

1733
01:27:35,898 --> 01:27:39,038
羅比 我想讓菲爾·薩維亞諾知道我們又重新著手這件事了
Robby, I'd like to let Phil saviano know that we're back on it.

1734
01:27:39,038 --> 01:27:40,808
好主意
Good idea.

1735
01:27:40,808 --> 01:27:44,078
跟漢西吃晚飯去吧 這可能會是很長時間以來的最後一次了
Go have dinner with Hansi. Might be the last time for a while.

1736
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:45,678
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

1737
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:52,118
羅比 我們見過麥克利什之後
Robby, after we saw macleish,

1738
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:54,148
我就開始重新看那些剪報
I started going back through the clips.

1739
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:56,318
上周終於有了點時間
And I had a little time last week finally.

1740
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:59,188
所以 嗯 我找到了這個
So, um, I found that.

1741
01:28:00,328 --> 01:28:02,058

It's from '93.

1742
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:14,008
就這個嗎
That it?

1743
01:28:15,508 --> 01:28:17,978
對對 就 就這個
Yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's it.

晚安
Good night.

1745
01:28:22,318 --> 01:28:24,078
好的 晚安
Okay. Good night.

1746
01:29:02,358 --> 01:29:03,718
你好
Hello.

1747
01:29:03,728 --> 01:29:05,858
所以 我大概比您小幾歲 是嗎
So, I was probably a few years after you, right?

1748
01:29:05,858 --> 01:29:08,558
不 你比我小多了
No, you were more than a few.

1749
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:10,158
相信我
Believe me.

1750
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:12,828
嗯 離開波士頓天主教高中之後 我去了普羅維登斯
Well, after bc high, I came down to Providence

1751
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:14,728
為修道士們打曲棍球
and played hockey for the friars.

1752
01:29:14,738 --> 01:29:17,738
哦 你一定表現得很不錯
Oh, well, you must have been pretty good.

1753
01:29:17,738 --> 01:29:20,338
不不 這水平在大學裏就只能坐冷板凳
No. Rode the bench in college. Yeah.

1754
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:21,868
但我愛這座城市
But I loved the city.

1755
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:24,038
啊哈 而且我們剛剛有了第三個孩子
Uh-huh. And we just had our third kid.

1756
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:26,478
而且提醒你一下 我還在看《環球報》
And I still get my globe, for the record.

1757
01:29:26,478 --> 01:29:29,748
啊 那很好 挺好的
Ah, that's good to know. Good to know.

1758
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:34,718
聽著 凱文 呃 其實我來這裏的原因
Look, Kevin, uh, that's actually why I'm here.

1759
01:29:34,718 --> 01:29:37,018
-嗯 -我
- Yeah? - I...

1760
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:39,788
我想問你幾個關於塔爾伯特神父的問題
I need to ask you some questions about father Talbot.

1761
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:48,768
你怎麼發現的
How'd you find out?

1762
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:51,898
這個 呃
Well-- um--

1763
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:54,008
我想這個應該不重要了
I guess it doesn't matter.

1764
01:29:57,538 --> 01:30:02,008
呵 我連我老婆都沒說過
Hell, I never even told my wife.

1765
01:30:04,178 --> 01:30:05,748
借過
Excuse me.

1766
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,388
嘿 嘿 嘿 我得進去
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I need to get in there.

-我們關門了 -拜託 讓我進去 五分鐘就好
- We're closed. - Come on. Let me in. Five minutes.

1768
01:30:14,058 --> 01:30:17,698
-抱歉 我們關門了 -拜託 五分鐘就好
- I'm sorry. We're closed. - Come on. Five minutes.

1769
01:30:32,148 --> 01:30:34,178
給 好了
Here. There.

1770
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:39,118
-這是關於吉歐根案的嗎 -沒錯
- This is the geoghan case? - That's right.

1771
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:42,048
-那些文件是密封的 -不 現在有個公開的動議
- Those records are sealed. - No. That's a public motion.

1772
01:30:42,058 --> 01:30:43,888
那些文件現在是公開的
Those records are public.

1773
01:30:43,888 --> 01:30:47,128
-我是《環球報》的 -挺行的啊
- Look, I work for the globe. - Good for you.

1774
01:30:48,828 --> 01:30:52,398
-我可以跟你的主管談談嗎 -他今天不在
- Can I talk to your supervisor? - He's not in today.

1775
01:30:52,398 --> 01:30:53,738
那法官呢
What about a judge? There

1776
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:56,268
一定有法官在處理這類事情的
must be judges that work on this kind of thing.

1777
01:30:56,268 --> 01:30:58,068
在六樓
Sixth floor.

1778
01:31:04,278 --> 01:31:05,658
我們明白對塔爾伯特神父的
We understand the nature

1779
01:31:05,658 --> 01:31:08,008
指控到底是怎麼一回事
of the allegations against father Talbot.

1780
01:31:08,018 --> 01:31:12,148
我只是不知道你們想從科莫扎校長身上問出些什麼
I'm just not sure what you want from president kemeza.

1781
01:31:12,148 --> 01:31:14,348
比爾接手的時候塔爾伯特已經離開很久了
Talbot taught here long before bill took over.

1782
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:15,918
嗯 當然
Mmm. Of course.

1783
01:31:15,918 --> 01:31:18,018
我們只是想知道是不是
We just want to know if it's possible

1784
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:20,088
包括校長 教職人員 董事會在內
that the president, the faculty, the board,

1785
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:21,988
都沒人知道那時候發生了什麼
that no one knew what was going on at the time.

1786
01:31:21,998 --> 01:31:24,158
我1979年畢業的
I graduated in 1979,

1787
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:26,268
但我完全不知道有這些事
and I had no idea about any of this.

1788
01:31:26,268 --> 01:31:28,298
所以如果你是在暗示吉本斯神父和
So if you're suggesting that father Gibbons

1789
01:31:28,298 --> 01:31:30,538
卡拉漢神父有任何方面的
and father Callahan had in any way--

1790
01:31:30,538 --> 01:31:32,138
吉本斯和卡拉漢
Gibbons and Callahan.

1791
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:34,708
我是說 他們像管海軍一樣管理這個地方
I mean, they ran this place like the Navy.

1792
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:36,338
你真的覺得他們不知道嗎
You really think they didn't know?

1793
01:31:36,338 --> 01:31:40,278
這間學校大得很 羅比 你知道的
It's a big school, robby. You know that.

1794
01:31:40,278 --> 01:31:41,878
現在我們說的是七個所謂的
And then we're talking about

1795
01:31:41,878 --> 01:31:44,518
受害者 還是差不多八年前的事嗎
seven alleged victims over, what, eight years?

1796
01:31:44,518 --> 01:31:48,018
不 我們現在知道的有七個
No, we're talking about, you know, seven that we know about.

1797
01:31:48,018 --> 01:31:50,218
太荒謬了
This is ridiculous.

1798
01:31:50,218 --> 01:31:52,558
-你們是在這裏挖新聞 -傑克 傑克
- You're reaching for a story here-- - Jack. Jack.

1799
01:31:52,558 --> 01:31:56,898
傑克 如果我是那時候的校長 我會知道的
Jack. If I had been president then, I would've known.

1800
01:31:56,898 --> 01:31:59,498
比爾 我不確定這有沒有關係
Bill, I'm not sure that's relevant.

1801
01:31:59,498 --> 01:32:02,838
不然你覺得他們為什麼把塔爾伯特送到捨沃羅斯
Why do you think they sent Talbot up to cheverus?

1802
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:05,298
你知道他們想讓他離開這裏
You know they wanted him out of town.

1803
01:32:06,408 --> 01:32:08,038
羅比
Robby,

1804
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:10,338
就像比爾所說的 出於好意
as well intentioned as bill's remarks are,

1805
01:32:10,338 --> 01:32:11,688
我希望在達成共識之前
I'm hoping we can keep this

1806
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:13,948
這件事能先保密
between us until we all get on the same page.

1807
01:32:17,248 --> 01:32:20,248
這就是我們來這裏的原因嗎 達成共識
Is that why we're here, to get on the same page?

1808
01:32:20,248 --> 01:32:21,548
不 我們來這裏是因為你是
No, we're here because you're

1809
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:23,418
一名重要的校友 羅比 也是朋友
an important alumnus, robby, and a friend.

1810
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:27,558
正是 而且我們知道你跟我們一樣關心這所學校
Exactly. And we know you care about this school as much as we do.

1811
01:32:28,928 --> 01:32:30,758
你在這裏參加過體育運動嗎 傑克
Did you play a sport here, Jack?

1812
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:33,398
嗯 足球 怎麼了
Yeah. Football. Why?

1813
01:32:33,398 --> 01:32:35,168
嗯 我參加的是田徑
Mmm. I ran track.

1814
01:32:35,168 --> 01:32:37,268
我昨天去普羅維登斯
You know, I went to Providence yesterday

1815
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:39,568
跟塔爾伯特神父的受害者談過
to talk to one of father Talbot's victims.

1816
01:32:39,568 --> 01:32:43,578
他在這裏打曲棍球 而且打得不錯
He played hockey here. And he's one of the better ones.

1817
01:32:43,578 --> 01:32:47,178
他娶了老婆 有孩子 事業有成
He's got a wife, kids, good job.

1818
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:51,848
在大概十分鐘的深入談話之後
About 10 minutes into the conversation,

1819
01:32:51,848 --> 01:32:53,348
他失控了
the guy breaks down.

1820
01:32:53,348 --> 01:32:55,588
哭個不停
You know, couldn't stop crying.

1821
01:32:57,388 --> 01:33:01,028
說他一直想不通塔爾伯特神父為什麼會選中他
Said he could never figure out why father Talbot picked him.

1822
01:33:02,898 --> 01:33:05,628
塔爾伯特神父是曲棍球隊的教練
Father Talbot coached the hockey team.

1823
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:09,138
所以
So...

1824
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:12,638
我想我們比較幸運
I guess we just got lucky.

1825
01:33:12,638 --> 01:33:14,338
你跟我都是
You and me.

1826
01:33:20,778 --> 01:33:22,618
傑克·鄧恩在這學校工作嗎
Does Jack Dunn work for the school?

1827
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:24,248
沒有 他是波士頓大學的公關
No, he's PR for Boston college.

1828
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:26,248
他們需要幫助的時候就會找他
They call him when they need help.

1829
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:28,318
那皮特·康利呢 他為什麼在這兒
And Pete conley, why was he there?

1830
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:30,458
問得好 皮特是位重要校友
Good question. Pete's a big alum.

1831
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:33,158
但我直接聯繫比爾 請求坐下來詳談的
But I called bill directly and I asked for a sit-down.

1832
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:35,288
我沒提到過其他任何人
I never mentioned anybody else.

1833
01:33:36,398 --> 01:33:38,898
好像每個人都已經知道這件事了
It's like everybody already knows the story.

1834
01:33:38,898 --> 01:33:42,368
-對 除了我們 -而我們就在那裏工作
- Yeah. Except us. - And we work right there.

1835
01:33:45,908 --> 01:33:47,638

1836
01:33:47,638 --> 01:33:49,978
你好 我是《波士頓環球報》的記者麥克·雷贊德斯
Hi. I'm Mike Rezendes from the Boston Globe.

1837
01:33:49,978 --> 01:33:51,538
我想查閱資料室的
I'm having some trouble accessing

1838
01:33:51,538 --> 01:33:53,678
一些公開材料 但遇到了點困難
some public records down in the records room.

1839
01:33:53,678 --> 01:33:56,448
我能否與你談談
I was wondering if I could have a word with you?

1840
01:33:56,448 --> 01:33:58,378
-好的  -謝謝
-All right. -Thank you.

Thank you very much.

1842
01:34:03,288 --> 01:34:07,658
我得跟你說 雷贊德斯先生
These exhibits you're after, Mr. Rezendes,

1843
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:10,198
這些材料可是敏感的很
they're very sensitive records.

1844
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:13,198
無意冒犯 法官先生 但這不是問題所在
With all due respect, your honor, that's not the question.

1845
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:14,928
這些材料是公開的
The records are public.

1846
01:34:16,038 --> 01:34:18,468
也許吧 那你跟我講講
Maybe so, but tell me,

1847
01:34:18,468 --> 01:34:20,538
新聞記者有什麼責任
where's the editorial responsibility

1848
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:22,708
把這些記錄公諸於眾呢
in publishing records of this nature?

1849
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,298
那新聞記者又有什麼責任
Well, where's the editorial

1850
01:34:24,298 --> 01:34:26,548
不把這些記錄公諸於眾呢
responsibility in not publishing them?

1851
01:34:37,018 --> 01:34:39,488
你不能把這帶走 你得去複印一份
You can't take those. You need to make copies.

1852
01:34:39,488 --> 01:34:42,628
-我這就去複印室  -那裏四點鐘就關門了
-I'm going to the copy room. -It closed at 4:00.

1853
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:49,128
聽著 我給你
Look, I'll give you...

1854
01:34:51,068 --> 01:34:53,568
八十三塊 借用你的複印機
83 bucks to use yours.

1855
01:34:58,978 --> 01:35:01,408
嘿 出租車
Hey! Cabbie!

1856
01:35:01,418 --> 01:35:04,718
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1857
01:35:07,218 --> 01:35:10,018
到莫裏西大道的波士頓環球報大樓
Take me to the Boston Globe on morrissey boulevard.

1858
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:13,458
別走九十三大道 走多切斯特大道
Don't take 93. Take Dorchester Avenue.

1859
01:35:14,928 --> 01:35:17,028
羅比 這太不可思議了
Robby, it's incredible.

1860
01:35:17,028 --> 01:35:19,728
勞早就知道吉歐根的事了 這點毫無疑問
Law knew about Geoghan for years, no question.

1861
01:35:19,728 --> 01:35:22,938
有一名叫做瑪格麗特·加蘭特的女士給勞寄過一封信
There's a letter to law from a woman, Margaret Gallant,

1862
01:35:22,938 --> 01:35:24,098
她在上世紀八十年代初
who lived in Jamaica Plain

1863
01:35:24,098 --> 01:35:25,938
居住在牙買加平原 那時吉歐根是那裏的神父
in the early '80s when geoghan was there.

1864
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:27,438
聽聽這個
Listen to this.

1865
01:35:27,438 --> 01:35:29,608
「教會是我們家庭的根
"Our family is rooted in the church.

1866
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:32,338
哪怕身處痛苦之中 我們也竭力
Our desire is to protect the holy orders

1867
01:35:32,348 --> 01:35:34,708
維護著聖職
even in the midst of our agony

1868
01:35:34,718 --> 01:35:38,048
隱瞞了家族中七個男孩被侵犯的事實」
over the seven boys in our family who have been violated."

1869
01:35:38,048 --> 01:35:40,518
七個啊 羅比 七個男孩
Seven, robby. Seven boys.

1870
01:35:40,518 --> 01:35:43,618
「我們被迫保持沉默
"It was suggested we keep silent.

1871
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:47,128
我們從未質疑過教會的權威
We did not question the authority of the church two years ago.

1872
01:35:47,128 --> 01:35:50,128
直到兩年前 我得知神父吉歐根還在他的教區任職」
But since Father Geoghan is still in his parish--"

1873
01:35:50,128 --> 01:35:53,868
她把這封信寄給了勞 卻完全被無視了
but she sent it to law and law did shit.

1874
01:35:53,868 --> 01:35:57,438
這兒還有一封寄給勞的信 同一年的 聽著
Here's another one to law, same year. Listen to this.

1875
01:35:57,438 --> 01:36:00,108
「針對最近教會將神父吉歐根委派至
"A word on the recent assignment of father Geoghan...

1876
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:03,208
韋斯頓的聖朱麗亞教區一事 我有話要說
As an associate at St. Julia's in Weston.

1877
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:04,778
神父吉歐根曾有過
Father Geoghan has a history

1878
01:36:04,788 --> 01:36:07,148
性侵男童的記錄
of homosexual involvement with young boys.

1879
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:09,778
我想他最近被調離聖布蘭登教區
I understand his recent departure from St. Brendan's

1880
01:36:09,778 --> 01:36:11,778
也與此有關
may be related to this problem.

1881
01:36:11,788 --> 01:36:13,048
我能否請求教區
I wonder if Father Geoghan

1882
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:15,088
撤銷對其的降職處理
should not be reduced to just weekend work

1883
01:36:15,088 --> 01:36:16,988
而讓他接受治療
while receiving some kind of therapy.

1884
01:36:16,988 --> 01:36:19,988
對於您長期以來的關懷我感激不盡
You know how grateful I am to you for your constant concern.

1885
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:21,728
願主保佑您
Sincerely yours in our lord,

1886
01:36:21,728 --> 01:36:25,498
尊敬的主教大人約翰·M·達西 波士頓副主教上
most reverend John M D'arcy, auxiliary bishop of Boston.

1887
01:36:25,498 --> 01:36:27,128
一九八四年十二月七日」
December 7, 1984."

1888
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:28,798
這是一個副主教寫的信嗎
An auxiliary bishop wrote that?

1889
01:36:28,798 --> 01:36:30,468
這太令人震驚了
That's incredible.

1890
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:33,438
他越級了 我是說 加蘭特是什麼時候寫的信
He broke ranks. I mean, when did Gallant write her letter?

1891
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:35,608
1984年 勞直接無視了
1984. And law just ignored it.

1892
01:36:35,608 --> 01:36:37,908
這樣的信怎麼能無視呢
How do you ignore that freakin' letter?

1893
01:36:37,908 --> 01:36:39,508
但我們拿到了
We got 'em.

1894
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:42,448
看了這些信 我們不能想別的了 這是證據啊
You can't read these letters and think anything else. It's proof.

1895
01:36:42,448 --> 01:36:44,818
是啊 沒錯
Yeah, it is.

1896
01:36:44,818 --> 01:36:47,118
這很好
This is good work.

1897
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:49,248
我們要不要把它交給本
Should we take it up to Ben?

1898
01:36:49,258 --> 01:36:52,258
呃 不 暫時不要
Uh, no. Not yet.

1899
01:36:52,258 --> 01:36:55,858
為什麼不呢 我們抓到勞的把柄了 這就是啊
Why not? We got law. This is it.

1900
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:58,028
不 這只是勞包庇一個神父的證據
No, this is law covering for one priest.

1901
01:36:58,028 --> 01:36:59,598
還有其他九十位神父逍遙法外呢
There's another 90 out there.

1902
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:01,598
我知道 等我們拿到證據了再曝光他們也不遲
Yeah, we'll print that story when we get it,

1903
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:02,968
但我們現在得把這個報道出來
but we gotta go with this now.

1904
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:04,518
這個報道我不想倉促而行 麥克
I'm not gonna rush this story,Mike.

1905
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:06,368
我們別無選擇 羅比
We don't have a choice, Robby.

1906
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:08,538
如果我們不趕緊報道
If we don't rush to print,

1907
01:37:08,538 --> 01:37:09,348
就會有人
somebody else is going

1908
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:10,978
發現這些信件 搶先披露出來
to find these letters and butcher the story.

1909
01:37:10,978 --> 01:37:13,948
《先驅報》的喬·昆比當時就在法院蹲點呢
Joe Quimby from The Herald was at the freaking courthouse.

1910
01:37:13,948 --> 01:37:15,208
那我們就先寫一份報道放著
So we'll write a holding

1911
01:37:15,218 --> 01:37:17,478
同時緊盯《先驅報》的動向
story and we'll keep our eye on The Herald.

1912
01:37:17,488 --> 01:37:19,388
緊盯《先驅報》的動向
Keep our eye on The Herald?

1913
01:37:19,388 --> 01:37:21,388
如果他們插手進來 報道出了差錯的話 教會會把這事給壓下去的
They run this and get it wrong, the church will bury it.

1914
01:37:21,388 --> 01:37:23,188
-我們現在就得報道出來 -麥克 麥克
- We gotta do this now. - Mike, Mike.

1915
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:25,518
怎麼了 為什麼要猶豫不決呢
What? Why are we hesitating?

1916
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:27,888
巴倫讓我們抓勞的把柄 我們抓到了
Baron told us to get law. This is law.

1917
01:37:27,898 --> 01:37:29,898
巴倫是讓我們揭露整個系統
Baron told us to get the system.

1918
01:37:29,898 --> 01:37:31,038
我們需要著眼全局
We need the full scope.

1919
01:37:31,038 --> 01:37:33,568
這是我們了結此事的唯一途徑
That's the only thing that will put an end to this.

1920
01:37:33,568 --> 01:37:35,528
那我們把這拿去給本 讓他來做決定
Then let's take it to Ben, let him decide.

1921
01:37:35,538 --> 01:37:37,398
到時候我自然會拿給他看 這由我來決定
We'll take it to Ben when I say it's time.

1922
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:41,408
到時候了 羅比 是時候了
It's time, Robby! It's time!

1923
01:37:41,408 --> 01:37:45,408
他們早就知道了 卻放任悲劇降臨到孩子們身上
They knew and they let it happen. To kids!

1924
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:48,408
受害者本可能是你 也可能是我
Okay? It could've been you. It could've been me.

1925
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:50,918
可能是我們任何人
It could've been any of us.

1926
01:37:50,918 --> 01:37:52,748
我們得揭穿這些卑鄙小人
We gotta nail these scumbags.

1927
01:37:52,748 --> 01:37:55,888
我們得讓世人知道沒人能逃脫罪責
We gotta show people that nobody can get away with this.

1928
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:59,588
神父不可以 紅衣主教不可以 教皇也不可以
Not a priest or a cardinal or a freaking pope!

1929
01:38:02,098 --> 01:38:04,098
你說完了嗎
You finished?

1930
01:38:04,098 --> 01:38:07,398
對 我說完了 你簡直就是在放屁
Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.

1931
01:38:36,028 --> 01:38:37,858
你沒事吧
You okay?

1932
01:38:40,368 --> 01:38:42,798
嗯
Mmm.

1933
01:38:47,968 --> 01:38:49,438
你好 漢西
Hey, hansi.

1934
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:52,538
今天工作不順吧 麥克
Hard day at work, Mike?

1935
01:38:56,818 --> 01:38:58,748
-給 -謝謝
- Here. - Thank you.

1936
01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:01,588
我 我 我不知道我為什麼會那麼生氣
I-I-I-I don't know why I got so pissed off.

1937
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:03,258
我覺得羅比錯了
You know, I think Robby's wrong.

1938
01:39:03,258 --> 01:39:04,658
其實 你只是
You know, you're just--

1939
01:39:04,658 --> 01:39:07,228
你太關心這次報道了 麥克 大家都一樣
you care about the story, Mike. We all do.

1940
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:11,658
-是啊 也許吧 -嗯
- Yeah, I guess. - Hmm.

1941
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:16,568
我已經不再陪我奶奶去教堂了
I stopped going to church with my Nana.

1942
01:39:17,998 --> 01:39:20,008
這 這太難熬了 我
It was-- it was too hard. I--

1943
01:39:20,008 --> 01:39:22,168
你知道嗎 我坐在那裏
you know, I'd be sitting there,

1944
01:39:22,178 --> 01:39:25,478
然後就會想起喬·克勞利或者其他人
and I would start thinking about Joe Crowley or someone else,

1945
01:39:25,478 --> 01:39:29,178
然後我 我就會很憤怒
and I just-- I just got so angry.

1946
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:31,748
你有 你有告訴她原因嗎
Did you-- did you tell her why?

1947
01:39:33,188 --> 01:39:35,388
她一周要去三次教堂 麥克
She goes to church three times a week, Mike.

1948
01:39:40,258 --> 01:39:42,528
這真的使我很惱火
It really pisses me off.

1949
01:39:43,858 --> 01:39:46,698
你知道嗎
You know,

1950
01:39:46,698 --> 01:39:50,198
當我還是個小孩子的時候 我真的很喜歡去教堂
I actually really liked going to church when I was a little kid.

1951
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:52,038
嗯
Mmm.

1952
01:39:52,038 --> 01:39:55,008
-後來為什麼不去了呢 -沒什麼特別的原因
- Why'd you stop? - Typical shit.

1953
01:39:56,478 --> 01:39:58,608
但奇怪的是
But the weird thing is...

1954
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,378
我感覺
I think I--

1955
01:40:04,388 --> 01:40:07,448
我總覺得沒準有一天我會 我會
I think I figured that maybe one day I w-- I w--

1956
01:40:07,448 --> 01:40:11,618
我會再回去的
I would actually go back.

1957
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:14,788
我真的 我真的有這個打算的
I was really-- I was holding on to that.

1958
01:40:14,798 --> 01:40:16,358
嗯
Mm-hmm.

1959
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:21,128
當我看完那些信 然後
I read those letters, and it--

1960
01:40:21,138 --> 01:40:25,398
就好像是 心裏有什麼東西裂開了
and something just... cracked.

1961
01:40:26,308 --> 01:40:28,568
-這感覺很糟糕 -是啊
- It's a shitty feeling. - Yeah.

1962
01:40:29,908 --> 01:40:31,908
這種感覺很糟糕
It's a shitty feeling.

1963
01:40:35,518 --> 01:40:37,878
-看來你今天過得並不順啊 -嘿 皮特
- Looks like a long day. - Hey, Pete.

1964
01:40:37,888 --> 01:40:40,148
很抱歉我還得打攪你
I'm sorry to make it longer.

1965
01:40:40,148 --> 01:40:41,388
布萊恩
Brian.

1966
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:44,918
沒有人能拒絕和你喝一杯吧 皮特
Has anyone ever said no to a drink with you, Pete?

1967
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,388
嗯 當然有啊
Well, sure.

1968
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:49,928
關鍵是得堅持邀請
But the trick is to keep asking.

1969
01:40:49,928 --> 01:40:51,998
-為了波士頓  -波士頓
- For Boston. - Boston.

1970
01:40:53,028 --> 01:40:54,828
嗯
Mmm.

1971
01:40:54,838 --> 01:40:58,168
那麼 嗯 你是為了紅衣主教的事來的嗎
So, um, you here for the cardinal?

1972
01:40:58,168 --> 01:40:59,768
噢 不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1973
01:40:59,768 --> 01:41:03,578
我可不敢擅自代表紅衣主教 絕對不敢
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't presume to speak for the cardinal, no.

1974
01:41:04,938 --> 01:41:08,748
你知道的 這裏有很多人非常尊敬你 羅比
You know, you got a lot of people here who respect you, Robby.

1975
01:41:08,748 --> 01:41:11,348
-嗯 -因為你做的事
- Yeah.  - With work you do.

1976
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:14,848
-這讓我挺開心的 -因為你熱愛這個城市
- That's good to know. - It's 'cause you care about this place.

1977
01:41:14,858 --> 01:41:18,018
這也是你身為新聞人的原因 這是你的使命
It's why you do what you do. It's who you are.

1978
01:41:18,028 --> 01:41:23,398
但你要知道 人們現在需要教會的存在 比任何時候都需要
You know, but people need the church, more than ever right now.

1979
01:41:23,398 --> 01:41:25,598
你可以體會得到
You know, you can feel it.

1980
01:41:25,598 --> 01:41:27,698
並且紅衣主教 呃
And the cardinal, uh--

1981
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:32,238
你知道的 紅衣主教他 也許不是完人
you know, the cardinal, he might not be perfect.

1982
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:33,538
但我們不能因為幾粒老鼠屎
But we can't throw out all

1983
01:41:33,538 --> 01:41:35,638
就否定他的傑出貢獻
the good he's doing over a few bad apples.

1984
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,818
我現在跟你提這些
Now, you know, I'm bringing

1985
01:41:38,818 --> 01:41:41,478
是因為我知道這都是巴倫的主意
this up to you because I know this is Baron's idea.

1986
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:43,248
這是他要做的事
His agenda.

1987
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:45,148
我得告訴你 我是說 說句實話
I gotta tell ya, I mean, honest to god,

1988
01:41:45,148 --> 01:41:48,488
他不像我們這樣熱愛這座城市
I mean, he doesn't care about the city the way we do.

1989
01:41:48,488 --> 01:41:50,688
他怎麼可能呢
I mean, how could he?

1990
01:41:56,658 --> 01:41:58,798
這就是你們的慣用伎倆 對嗎 皮特
This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?

1991
01:41:58,798 --> 01:42:00,168
怎麼說
What's that?

1992
01:42:00,168 --> 01:42:01,968
一個人去威逼利誘另一個人
A guy leans on a guy,

1993
01:42:01,968 --> 01:42:05,638
然後忽然間對整座城市的看法都變了
and suddenly the whole town just looks the other way.

1994
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:10,578
羅比 羅比 聽著
Robby. Robby. Look it.

1995
01:42:11,678 --> 01:42:14,778
馬蒂·巴倫只是想賺點名氣罷了
Marty Baron is just trying to make his mark.

1996
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:17,448
他只會在這裏呆上幾年 然後就會陞遷離開了
He's gonna be here for a couple of years and he's gonna move on.

1997
01:42:17,448 --> 01:42:20,418
就像他在紐約和邁阿密時一樣
Just like he did in New York and Miami.

1998
01:42:21,688 --> 01:42:23,758
但是你又能去哪裏呢
Where are you gonna go?

1999
01:42:25,358 --> 01:42:26,988
嗯
Hmm?

2000
01:42:28,488 --> 01:42:31,098
晚安 羅比 布萊恩
Good night, Robby. Brian.

2001
01:42:32,198 --> 01:42:34,798
-嘿 呃 皮特  -什麼事
- Hey, uh, Pete. - Yeah?

2002
01:42:34,798 --> 01:42:38,598
呃 當我們真的報道此事時
Uh, when we do run the story,

2003
01:42:38,608 --> 01:42:41,168
額 我需要紅衣主教的評論
uh, I'm gonna need a comment from the cardinal.

2004
01:42:43,378 --> 01:42:46,038
我們回頭再談 晚安 羅比
We'll talk again later. Good night, Robby.

2005
01:42:46,048 --> 01:42:48,008
晚安 皮特
Night, Pete.

2006
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:59,218
我是羅比
Robby.

2007
01:43:00,688 --> 01:43:02,388
什麼
What?

2008
01:43:02,398 --> 01:43:04,758
真的假的 什麼時候
No shit. When?

2009
01:43:06,568 --> 01:43:08,968
好的 好
Okay. Yeah.

2010
01:43:11,838 --> 01:43:14,068
嘿
Hey.

2011
01:43:14,068 --> 01:43:15,638
怎麼了
What's up?

2012
01:43:16,678 --> 01:43:18,808
斯威尼做出了支持我們的裁決
Sweeney ruled in our favor.

2013
01:43:18,808 --> 01:43:21,048
她判決將文件開封
She ruled to unseal the documents.

2014
01:43:22,548 --> 01:43:24,948
天哪 哈
Geez. Huh.

2015
01:43:27,018 --> 01:43:29,248
教會已經提起了上訴
The church has already filed an appeal.

2016
01:43:29,258 --> 01:43:32,418
但初審法院對此的判決仍舊有效
But the trial court ruling is generally upheld in these matters.

2017
01:43:32,428 --> 01:43:34,888
那我們什麼時候能拿到那些文件
And when would we get the documents?

2018
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:37,828
科恩也許還得花幾周時間來處理
Probably takes Cohen a few weeks to rule.

2019
01:43:37,828 --> 01:43:39,928
然後還需要走一個校訂的流程
Then there's a redaction process.

2020
01:43:39,928 --> 01:43:43,998
呃 我認為在一月中旬文件就能公佈了
Uh, I'd say they'd be made public mid-January.

2021
01:43:43,998 --> 01:43:45,438
-好的 -行了
- Okay. - All right.

2022
01:43:45,438 --> 01:43:46,608
-謝謝 約翰  -沒事
- Thanks, John. - You bet.

2023
01:43:46,608 --> 01:43:47,868
-你做得很棒  -謝謝
- Nice work. - Thanks.

2024
01:43:47,878 --> 01:43:50,438
《都市報》得寫點東西出來 馬蒂
Metro should run something, Marty.

2025
01:43:50,438 --> 01:43:52,108
這事我們不能大肆宣傳
We can't run this one big.

2026
01:43:52,108 --> 01:43:55,748
為什麼不能 這是一次意義重大的挑戰修正案的勝利啊
Why wouldn't we? It's a major first amendment victory.

2027
01:43:55,748 --> 01:43:57,068
更別提你成功讓
Not to mention, you get an

2028
01:43:57,068 --> 01:43:59,448
一個愛爾蘭裔天主教法官來對抗教會
Irish catholic judge ruling against the church?

2029
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:01,948
-這可是個了不得的先例啊 -嗯
- That's a hell of a precedent. - Mm-hmm.

2030
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:04,288
我們不能讓《先驅報》深挖此事
We don't want The Herald going deep on this.

2031
01:44:04,288 --> 01:44:06,158
為什麼
Why's that?

2032
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:10,298
你得先迴避一下 彼得
You're gonna have to step out, Peter.

2033
01:44:10,298 --> 01:44:11,998
我才不迴避呢
I'm not stepping out.

2034
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:21,268
彼得
Peter.

2035
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,118
-你是什麼時候 呃  -幾周前
- When did you, uh-- - a couple of weeks ago.

2036
01:44:38,128 --> 01:44:39,828
幾周前
A couple of weeks?

2037
01:44:39,828 --> 01:44:41,488
-是的  -然後你現在才告訴我們嗎
- Yeah. - And you're telling us now?

2038
01:44:41,498 --> 01:44:44,158
這些材料太重要了
These are substantial.

2039
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:46,598
這些材料清楚地表明勞有瀆職行為
They clearly show that law was negligent.

2040
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:48,428
我需要更多時間
I need more time.

2041
01:44:48,438 --> 01:44:50,498
-我想接著調查下去  -調查什麼
- I wanna keep digging. - For what?

2042
01:44:50,498 --> 01:44:52,838
-這就是事情真相了  -這不是事實的全部
- This is the goddamn story. - It's not the whole story.

2043
01:44:52,838 --> 01:44:54,638
這很棘手啊 我們沒剩下多少時間了
Tough shit. We're on a clock now.

2044
01:44:54,638 --> 01:44:56,408
即使我們不報道斯威尼的判決結果
Even if we don't run Sweeney's ruling,

2045
01:44:56,408 --> 01:44:58,638
其他報社也可能會發現這些信件 搶先報道
another paper could find these letters and fuck the story.

2046
01:44:58,648 --> 01:45:00,848
我知道 但如果我們單獨報道這些信件
Agreed. But we run these letters alone,

2047
01:45:00,848 --> 01:45:04,148
勞會道歉 說只發生過一次 他可以把真相掩蓋起來
law apologizes, says it's a one-time thing. He can bury it.

2048
01:45:04,148 --> 01:45:07,648
怎麼掩蓋 這些信件證明了他知道罪行卻毫無作為
How? These clearly show he knew and did nothing about it.

2049
01:45:07,648 --> 01:45:10,858
聽著 我快要把全部七十個神父的醜聞挖到底了
Look, I'm close to stories on 70 priests.

2050
01:45:10,858 --> 01:45:13,688
我們把那些全部搞定後 再加上這些信件
We nail that, along with those letters,

2051
01:45:13,688 --> 01:45:17,198
就能證明此事不只是勞的過失
this is proof that this is bigger than law.

2052
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:19,798
而且是整個體系的腐壞
It's the whole system.

2053
01:45:19,798 --> 01:45:22,268
你有足夠證據證明全部神父的罪過嗎
You have multiple sources confirming all those priests?

2054
01:45:22,268 --> 01:45:25,868
-有一部分了 我可以拿到更多 -太冒險了
- On some. I can get more. - Too risky.

2055
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:27,228
如果我們不把他們每個人
If we're not buttoned up on every

2056
01:45:27,228 --> 01:45:29,268
挖的底朝天 教會就會挑我們的毛病
single one of them, the church will pick us apart.

2057
01:45:31,038 --> 01:45:33,708
我可以為我們爭取到教會那邊的一個證人
I think I can get us someone from the other side of the aisle.

2058
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,548
教會內部的人嗎
Somebody inside the church?

2059
01:45:36,548 --> 01:45:38,378
是的 一名律師
Yeah. A lawyer.

2060
01:45:38,388 --> 01:45:40,488
他願意公開證明嗎
Will he go on the record?

2061
01:45:40,488 --> 01:45:42,948
他背景很深 但值得信賴
Deep background. But he's a solid source.

2062
01:45:46,558 --> 01:45:48,888
雷贊德斯需要時間來寫報道
Rezendes needs time to write the story.

2063
01:45:48,898 --> 01:45:51,798
我們不能在聖誕節披露 尤其是九·一一事件過後
We don't want to drop it at Christmas, not after 9/11.

2064
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:54,828
我們可以在新年後報導
We could run it just after new year's,

2065
01:45:54,838 --> 01:45:57,698
趕在他們公佈剩下的文件之前
before they release the rest of the documents.

2066
01:46:01,068 --> 01:46:03,008
好的
All right.

2067
01:46:03,008 --> 01:46:06,108
告訴卡內洛斯別報道這次裁決了
Tell Canellos to bury the ruling in Metro.

2068
01:46:07,578 --> 01:46:09,548
你有六周時間
You got six weeks.

2069
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:11,918
謝謝
Thank you.

2070
01:46:11,918 --> 01:46:14,248
告訴麥克在聖誕節前將初稿交給我
Tell Mike I want a draft by Christmas.

2071
01:46:14,248 --> 01:46:16,388
我們還需要教堂方面的回應
And we need a response from lake street.

2072
01:46:16,388 --> 01:46:18,588
紅衣主教的公關是誰 還是約翰·沃什嗎
Who does PR for the cardinal? Still John Walsh?

2073
01:46:18,588 --> 01:46:22,188
不是 是個新人 叫唐娜·莫裏西 之前在TV網任職 她還很年輕
No, somebody new. Donna Morrissey. She came from TV. She's young.

2074
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:23,098
好的 去做一份引述
Good. Get a quote. We

2075
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:25,028
我們得準備點勞的言論 以示公正
need something from law to appear evenhanded.

2076
01:46:25,028 --> 01:46:27,498
羅比 下次得提前給我提個醒
Robby, next time give me a goddamn heads-up.

2077
01:46:27,498 --> 01:46:29,698
好的
Will do.

2078
01:47:52,018 --> 01:47:54,848
羅比 真是稀客啊
Robby, what a nice surprise.

2079
01:47:54,858 --> 01:47:56,418
快請進
Come on in.

2080
01:48:02,658 --> 01:48:06,198
嘿 親愛的 看看是誰來了
Hey, hon, look who I found outside.

2081
01:48:08,798 --> 01:48:11,168
凱倫 能讓我們單獨待會兒嗎
Karen, can you give us a minute?

2082
01:48:12,198 --> 01:48:15,338
-當然 -見到你很高興 凱倫
- Sure. - Good to see you, Karen.

2083
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:20,108
什麼事
What's up?

2084
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:37,398
我快沒時間了 吉姆
I'm out of time, Jim.

2085
01:48:37,398 --> 01:48:40,728
我們已經寫好了七十位神父的醜聞報道
We've got cover-up stories on 70 priests.

2086
01:48:40,728 --> 01:48:42,448
但我的上級要求
But the boss isn't gonna run

2087
01:48:42,448 --> 01:48:45,138
必須得到你們這邊的證實後才能披露
it unless I get confirmation from your side.

2088
01:48:47,368 --> 01:48:49,038
你瘋了嗎
Are you out of your mind?

2089
01:48:49,038 --> 01:48:51,678
拜託了 這是我們的城市啊 吉米
Come on. This is our town, Jimmy.

2090
01:48:51,678 --> 01:48:56,748
每個人都知道有罪惡在發生 可沒人有所行動
Everybody knew something was going on, and no one did a thing.

2091
01:48:56,748 --> 01:49:00,688
-我們必須結束這一切 -不用你來提醒我該做什麼
- We gotta put an end to it. - Don't tell me what I gotta do.

2092
01:49:00,688 --> 01:49:03,858
沒錯 我是幫這些卑鄙小人做了辯護 但那是我的職責所在 羅比
Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags, but that's my job, Robby.

2093
01:49:03,858 --> 01:49:06,288
我只是在盡職
I was doing my job.

2094
01:49:07,358 --> 01:49:09,428
是啊
Yeah.

2095
01:49:09,428 --> 01:49:11,158
你跟其他人一樣
You and everyone else.

2096
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:21,508
滾出我的房子
Get out of my house.

2097
01:49:32,518 --> 01:49:34,018
嘿
Hey!

2098
01:49:35,448 --> 01:49:38,188
你來我家就為了說這些的嗎
You come to my home and lay this shit on me?

2099
01:49:39,088 --> 01:49:41,358
你說得對 羅比
You were right, Robby.

2100
01:49:41,358 --> 01:49:44,298
每個人都知道有罪惡發生
We all knew something was going on.

2101
01:49:44,298 --> 01:49:48,528
那你當時在哪裏呢 你為什麼耽誤了這麼久
So where were you? What took you so long?

2102
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:56,468
我不知道 吉姆
I don't know, Jim.

2103
01:50:01,648 --> 01:50:04,048
把名單給我
Give me the list.

2104
01:50:59,038 --> 01:51:01,438
拉裏 我們六小時後就要報道了
Larry, we're going to press in six hours.

2105
01:51:01,438 --> 01:51:02,328
唐娜·莫裏西幾小時前說
Donna Morrissey said she'd

2106
01:51:02,338 --> 01:51:03,708
她會打給我們 轉述勞的聲明
call us with a quote from law hours ago.

2107
01:51:03,708 --> 01:51:06,178
-我也以為 -你是什麼時候跟她說的
- That's what I thought. - When did you talk to her?

2108
01:51:06,178 --> 01:51:08,378
-好的 好的 拉裏 -好的

有什麼新動向嗎
Anything?

2111
01:51:13,488 --> 01:51:15,178
康利說唐娜·莫裏西早該打電話過來的
Conley said Donna Morrissey should've called.

2112
01:51:15,178 --> 01:51:16,118
他剛離開教堂
He just left lake street.

2113
01:51:16,118 --> 01:51:18,018
是啊 拉斯基也是這麼說的
Yeah, Rasky said the same thing.

2114
01:51:18,018 --> 01:51:20,328
這太可笑了 你覺得他們還想先下手為強
This is ridiculous. You'd think they want to get ahead of this.

2115
01:51:20,328 --> 01:51:22,458
我是說 他們要不提前採取行動才是傻呢
I mean, they'd be idiots not to.

2116
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:25,658
我真想看看他們讀了我們的報道之後的表情
I would love to see their faces when they read this thing.

2117
01:51:25,668 --> 01:51:28,198
星期天可是盛大的主顯節呢
You know,Sunday's the feast of the epiphany.

2118
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:31,038
那挺合適的
That seems appropriate.

2119
01:51:35,808 --> 01:51:37,408
我是麥克·雷贊德斯
Mike Rezendes.

2120
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:40,578
你好 唐娜
Hey, Donna.

2121
01:51:40,578 --> 01:51:41,748
感謝你的來電 是啊
Thanks for calling. Yeah,

2122
01:51:41,748 --> 01:51:43,978
如果你有空的話 我想問幾個問題
I just had a few questions if you have a minute.

2123
01:51:46,318 --> 01:51:47,448
什麼
What?

2124
01:51:48,848 --> 01:51:51,418
-怎麼了  -又有個形容詞使用不當
- What? - Another adjective.

2125
01:51:52,888 --> 01:51:54,928
-有什麼消息嗎 -勞剛剛回絕了我們的提問
- Anything? - Law just turned us down.

2126
01:51:54,928 --> 01:51:56,528
天啊
Jesus Christ.

2127
01:51:56,528 --> 01:51:58,658
我剛和唐娜·莫裏西通完電話
I just got off the phone with Donna Morrissey.

2128
01:51:58,668 --> 01:52:00,008
引述如下 「我們連問題是什麼
She said, quote, "We don't even

2129
01:52:00,008 --> 01:52:02,098
都沒有興趣知道」 轉述完畢
want to know what the questions are," End quote.

2130
01:52:02,098 --> 01:52:03,938
-她真的這樣說嗎 -是的
- She really said that? - Yeah.

2131
01:52:03,938 --> 01:52:05,668
嗯 這樣也行
Well, that ought to do it.

2132
01:52:05,668 --> 01:52:07,408
「教會對於《環球報》的疑問
"The church had no interest

2133
01:52:07,408 --> 01:52:10,068
表示毫無興趣」
in knowing what the globe's questions would be."

2134
01:52:11,278 --> 01:52:13,778
把這句話加到重點內容前面 還有別的嗎
Work it in somewhere before the jump. Anything else?

2135
01:52:13,778 --> 01:52:15,258
馬特想把信件放到網上
Matt wants to put the letters

2136
01:52:15,258 --> 01:52:17,548
以供讀者自行查閱
online so the readers can see for themselves.

2137
01:52:17,548 --> 01:52:20,078
我們可以在文章最後附上網址鏈接
We can run the url at the bottom of the article.

2138
01:52:20,088 --> 01:52:21,948
-這樣挺方便的 -好的
- It's pretty straightforward. - Okay.

2139
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,218
我們還可以把辦公室的專線電話
We also put the spotlight tip

2140
01:52:23,228 --> 01:52:25,458
放在文末 方便大家打進來
line at the end of the story so people can call in.

2141
01:52:25,458 --> 01:52:26,958
直接打到我們辦公室來
Goes directly to our office.

2142
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:29,458
我和馬特也可以一早就來 以便接電話
Matt and I can go in in the morning in case we get any calls.

2143
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,628
嗯 我更擔心接待處的電話
Yeah, I'm more concerned about the phones at reception.

2144
01:52:31,628 --> 01:52:32,888
在我們報道了波特案之後
After we ran the Porter case,

2145
01:52:32,888 --> 01:52:34,768
電話中心好幾周都忙得不可開交
the message centers were tied up for weeks.

2146
01:52:34,768 --> 01:52:36,938
-這是個問題 -糾察員也是個問題
- It's a real problem. - There were picketers too.

2147
01:52:36,938 --> 01:52:38,398
大家都很忙
Lots of 'em.

2148
01:52:38,408 --> 01:52:40,638
我會跟理查德談安保工作和電話問題的
I'll talk to Richard about the security and the phones.

2149
01:52:40,638 --> 01:52:43,468
呃 後續報道要怎樣進行
Uh, how are we coming on the folo story?

2150
01:52:43,478 --> 01:52:47,048
嗯 我們把全部七十個神父的報道都搞定了
Well, we've nailed down multiple stories on 70 priests.

2151
01:52:47,948 --> 01:52:49,748
-全部七十個嗎  -嗯
- All 70? - Mm-hmm.

2152
01:52:49,748 --> 01:52:52,318
而且拿到了羅比線人的證明 我們隨時可以報道了
And with confirmation from Robby's source, we're ready to go.

2153
01:52:52,318 --> 01:52:54,548
我們下周內可以寫好初稿
We can have a draft next week.

2154
01:52:54,548 --> 01:52:58,218
羅比 那位給你提供消息的人 我們可以重訪嗎
Robby, that source of yours, is it something we could revisit?

2155
01:52:59,828 --> 01:53:01,588
可能有點困難
It might be tough.

2156
01:53:01,588 --> 01:53:02,858
那他給幾十個下賤的神父
But he has no problem helping

2157
01:53:02,858 --> 01:53:04,728
打掩護時就不困難了嗎
the church protect dozens of dirty priests.

2158
01:53:04,728 --> 01:53:07,598
-那傢伙可真卑鄙 -他是一名律師 他只是在做他應做的
- Guy's a scumbag. - He's a lawyer. He's doing his job.

2159
01:53:07,598 --> 01:53:10,098
-他就是教會僱傭的騙子 -他是在助紂為虐
- He's a shill for the church. - He knew and did nothing.

2160
01:53:10,098 --> 01:53:12,668
他本可以早點說出來 也許還能救回幾條命
He could've said something years ago, maybe saved some lives.

2161
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:15,438
那我們呢
What about us?

2162
01:53:15,438 --> 01:53:18,178
-這是什麼意思 -我們早就有不少線索了
- What's that supposed to mean? - We had all the pieces.

2163
01:53:18,178 --> 01:53:20,238
為什麼沒能早點發掘真相呢
Why didn't we get it sooner?

2164
01:53:20,248 --> 01:53:22,408
-我們哪裏有很多線索了 -我們有薩維亞諾
- We didn't have all the pieces. - We had saviano.

2165
01:53:22,418 --> 01:53:24,248
巴雷特和吉歐根
We had Barrett. We had Geoghan.

2166
01:53:24,248 --> 01:53:26,178
還有地下室裏那些人名錄
We had the directories in the basement.

2167
01:53:26,188 --> 01:53:27,958
這樣說吧 我們現在有了結果
You know what? We got it now.

2168
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:30,018
羅比 這個報道需要聚焦小組的努力
Robby, the story needed spotlight.

2169
01:53:30,018 --> 01:53:33,358
麥克 這個組1970年就成立了
Mike, spotlight's been around since 1970.

2170
01:53:33,358 --> 01:53:36,358
那又怎樣 我們又沒辦法預知未來 沒人可以
So what? We couldn't see the scope of this. No one could.

2171
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:38,728
羅比 這是由一個該死的神父牽扯出來的
Robby, this started with one goddamn priest.

2172
01:53:41,268 --> 01:53:44,198
麥克利什幾年前寄來過一封信 檢舉了二十個神父
Macleish sent us a letter on 20 priests years ago.

2173
01:53:44,198 --> 01:53:46,138
薩夏找到了剪報
Sacha found the clip.

2174
01:53:46,138 --> 01:53:48,208
你開什麼玩笑 二十名神父嗎
You freaking kidding? Twenty priests?

2175
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,868
什麼時候
When?

2176
01:53:51,038 --> 01:53:54,108
呃 就在波特案之後 93年12月
Uh, just after Porter. December '93.

2177
01:53:54,108 --> 01:53:56,848
我們把這事給了《都市報》 沒有進行後續報道
We buried the story in Metro. No folo.

2178
01:53:57,948 --> 01:53:59,548
是你嗎
That was you?

2179
01:54:00,848 --> 01:54:02,448
你那時是《都市報》的主管
You were Metro.

2180
01:54:03,558 --> 01:54:06,388
是的 是我
Yeah. That was me.

2181
01:54:06,388 --> 01:54:08,888
我那時剛接管 完全不記得有這回事
I'd just taken over. I don't remember it at all.

2182
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:11,458
但是 沒錯
But yeah.

2183
01:54:14,728 --> 01:54:16,898
嗯
Um,

2184
01:54:16,898 --> 01:54:19,638
我能不能 呃 說幾句
can I, uh, say something here?

2185
01:54:20,838 --> 01:54:22,668
有時候我們很容易就忘記了
Sometimes it's easy to forget

2186
01:54:22,678 --> 01:54:26,208
很多時候我們都在黑暗邊緣徘徊
that we spend most of our time stumbling around in the dark.

2187
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:27,848
一旦光明降臨
Suddenly a light gets turned on,

2188
01:54:27,848 --> 01:54:30,918
罪人自會接受懲罰
and there's a fair share of blame to go around.

2189
01:54:32,888 --> 01:54:35,418
我無法對調任此地之前的事情作過多評論
I can't speak to what happened before I arrived,

2190
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:40,588
但是 呃 你們所有人都為這次的報道貢獻頗多
but, uh, all of you have done some very good reporting here.

2191
01:54:40,588 --> 01:54:43,258
這類報道能夠迅速引起讀者
Reporting that I believe is gonna have an immediate

2192
01:54:43,258 --> 01:54:46,328
大範圍的關注
and considerable impact on our readers.

2193
01:54:48,268 --> 01:54:51,768
於我而言 這就是我們新聞行業的價值所在
For me, this kind of story is why we do this.

2194
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:53,368
我說過
Having said that,

2195
01:54:53,368 --> 01:54:55,538
勞主教和天主教社區
cardinal law and the catholic community

2196
01:54:55,538 --> 01:54:57,908
肯定會對此事有強烈的反應
are gonna have a very strong response to this.

2197
01:54:59,038 --> 01:55:01,278
所以 如果你們需要休息
So if you need a moment,

2198
01:55:01,278 --> 01:55:03,048
完全沒問題
you've earned it.

2199
01:55:03,048 --> 01:55:05,578
但是 呃
But, uh,

2200
01:55:05,588 --> 01:55:07,618
你們週一早上必須到崗
I will need you back here Monday morning,

2201
01:55:07,618 --> 01:55:11,758
全力準備 專心工作

01:55:19,398 --> 01:55:22,268
-走嗎 -好的
- Leaving? - Yeah.

2203
01:55:28,068 --> 01:55:30,738
我 呃 剛剛接到了紅衣主教的電話
I, uh, just got a call from the cardinal.

2204
01:55:30,738 --> 01:55:32,638
真的嗎 為什麼
Really. Why?

2205
01:55:32,648 --> 01:55:36,048
他想親自告訴我 他決定不對此事做任何評論
He wanted to tell me personally that he decided not to comment.

2206
01:55:36,048 --> 01:55:40,818
他還說 他願意 呃 增加給我的好處
Yeah. Said he wanted to, uh, extend me that courtesy.

2207
01:55:40,818 --> 01:55:44,158
天哪 那傢伙可真有膽量 你是怎麼說的
Jesus, the balls on that guy. What did you say?

2208
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:45,558
我跟他說 他這麼做是錯的
I told him he was making a

2209
01:55:45,558 --> 01:55:47,988
而且我們肯定會把這件事報道出來
mistake and that we were gonna run the story.

2210
01:55:47,988 --> 01:55:50,228
我們當然要報道這事
Damn right we're gonna run it.

2211
01:56:14,518 --> 01:56:16,688
薩夏 能給我倒杯水嗎
Sacha, can I have a drink of water?

2212
01:56:17,818 --> 01:56:20,418
好的 沒問題 奶奶 好的
Yeah. Sure, Nana. Yeah.

2213
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:32,838
我能留著這份報紙嗎
Can I keep this?

2214
01:56:34,008 --> 01:56:35,468
當然
Sure.

2215
01:56:35,478 --> 01:56:38,038
我認為應該先拿給你看看
I thought you should see it first.

2216
01:56:38,038 --> 01:56:40,008
謝謝你把它拿給我
Thank you for bringing it by.

2217
