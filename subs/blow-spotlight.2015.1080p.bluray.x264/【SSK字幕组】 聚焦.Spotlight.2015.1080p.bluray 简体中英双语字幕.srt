-我们还需要一会儿 保罗 -好的 神父

55
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:27,001
希拉 现在我以个人名义保证

交情比你们大多数人活得还要久

斯图尔特 我觉得
Now, Stewart, I find the timing

75

00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,838
我不是在问你警察局是不是在撒谎 我知道他们在撒谎
I'm not asking if the pd's lying. I know they're lying.

正好给你一小时决定
That'll give you an hour to decide

93
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,848
你到底要不要在站在正确的一方
whether you want to be on the right side of this

94
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,748
还是想像其他人一样读着我们的报道
or read about it like everybody else.

95
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,588
-再见 丹 -你觉得卡希尔手上有料吗
- Bye, Dan. - You think Cahill has something?

96
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:04,788
可能吧 我只是觉得我们不该做这个故事
Maybe. I just don't think the story's for us.

97
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,858
-本喜欢 -是啊 它还行

98
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,188
-只是不符合聚焦的风格 -什么不符合
- It's just not spotlight. - What's just not spotlight?

99
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,798
-警察局的数据 -那个数据的报道 感觉很站不住脚
- The pd numbers. - The numbers story. It feels thin.

100
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:14,168
噢 你让卡希尔开口了吗
Oh. You got Cahill to talk?

101
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,698

No. But I will.

102
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:20,068
很好 到时我们就知道站不站得住脚了
Good. Then we'll know if it's thin.

103
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,538

107
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,178
他们在吸我们的血
They're leeching us.

108
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,818
他们从迈阿密派了个人过来 情况应该会好点
They're sending a guy from Miami to run things. That should help.

109
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,488
巴伦之前在波士顿待过吗
Has Baron even spent time in Boston?

110
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:39,058
我想他之前从没来过这里 我们应该给他买张地图
I don't think he's been here before. We should buy him a map.

111
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:42,058
-我在迈阿密的一个朋友说他裁了百分之十五的员工 -真棒
- A friend down in Miami said he cut 15% of the staff. - Great.

00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,368
-你不是要和他坐下来谈吗 -是的

116
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,248
但我知道本想要
But I do know that Ben

117
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:56,208
那个犯罪数据的报道
needs an answer on the crime numbers story.

118
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,708
我和你说 我真的觉得我们不该做这个故事
I'm telling you, I really don't think that story's for us.

119
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,818
-巴伦先生 -噢

新闻编辑部里很多人都是
A lot of the newsroom is from here.

133
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:43,248
感觉就好像是 一家本地报社
It really feels like a-- like a local paper in that way.

134
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,858
报纸被《纽约时报》收购后有改变这个感觉吗
And did that change at all after the paper was sold to the times?

135
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:51,398
没有 没 我觉得还不至于有这么大影响

145
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,488
我们刚完结一个假冒建筑公司的报道
We just put out a piece on a shoddy construction outfit,

146
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,268
现在我们只是在
and right now we're really

147
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,998
寻找有没有值得挖掘的故事
just trolling around for our next story.

148
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:27,498
这一般需要多长时间
How long does that typically take?

149
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,868
很难说 额 几个月吧
Hard to say. Uh, a couple months.

150
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,498
-几个月 -是的
- Couple months? - Yeah.

151
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,408
我们不想操之过急
We don't like to rush it.

152
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,508
我们一旦选定一个项目
Once we settle on a project,

153
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,878
我们会花上一年甚至更多的时间去调查
we can spend a year or more investigating it.

154
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,118
-有什么问题吗 -不一定
- Is that a concern? - Not necessarily.

155
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,518
嗯 但从我所了解的看来 阅读量正在下降
Um, but from what I understand, readership is down.

156
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:51,458
互联网侵入了各行各业 还有 额
Internet is cutting into the classified business and, uh,

157
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,758
我想我需要对这些事情严肃对待
I think I'm gonna need to take a hard look at things.

158
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,798
所以 你希望精简人员
So, you anticipate more cuts.

159
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:02,668
额 可以这么说
Uh, I think it's safe to assume so.

160
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:07,438
但是 额 我现在更关注的是 要如何让读者
But, uh, what I'm more focused on right now is finding a way to--

161
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:11,178
觉得这份报纸不可或缺
to make this paper essential to its readers.

162
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,378
我觉得它已经做到了
I like to think it already is.

163
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,778
好吧 我只是认为我们可以做得更好
Fair enough. I just think that we can do better.

164
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,228
-布莱德利先生 -嘿
- Mr. Bradlee. - Hey.

165
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,068
看到警察局的数据了 看起来很有趣
Saw the pd numbers. Looks interesting.

166
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,868
是啊 里面有点故事
Yeah, there's something there.

167
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,898
-你还需要多长时间 -额 再多一周
- How long do you need? - Uh, another week.

168
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:42,408
-你要去哪 -去开会啊
- Where are you going? - To the 10:30.

169
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,908
你什么时候也要开会了
Since when?

170
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:46,308
严格来说 我是个编辑
Well, technically, I am an editor.

171
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:50,008
严格来说而已 你和巴伦聊的怎么样
Technically. Your sit-down with baron go that well?

172
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,018
-我读不懂他这个人 -居然有你读不懂的人
- I couldn't get a read on him. - That's a first.

173
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,518
-那你呢 -他是个开心果啊
- How about you? - Well, he's a barrel of laughs.

174
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,258
-大家早上好 -那我们开始吧
- Morning, everyone. - Let's get started.

175
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,658
你想说几句吗 马蒂
Do you want to say something, Marty?

176
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,198
额 好的
Uh, sure.

177
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:06,998
额 大家好
Uh, hello.

178
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:09,898
额 大家应该都知道
Uh, as most of you know by now,

180
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,668
我 很开心来到这里
I'm, uh, delighted to be here.

181
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:17,448
我们轮着说话的时候
Um, if you could tell me

182
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:20,778
如果你们能顺便说一下自己的名字就更好了
your name as we go around, that'd be helpful.

183
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,408
谢谢
Thank you.

184
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,778
好的 彼得
Okay. Peter?

185
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,948
彼得・卡内洛斯 来自《都市报》
Peter canellos, Metro.

186
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:30,248
我有个大故事要挖完了
I've got a major big dig closure.

187
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,188
-嘿 史蒂夫 -麦克
- Hey, Steve. - Mike.

188
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:37,288
嘿 昨晚的比赛很烂吧
Hey. Crappy game last night, huh?

189
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:39,358
是啊 他们的击球烂到爆了
Yeah, they can't hit worth a nickel.

190
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:40,458
嘿 听着 那个
Hey, listen, what's,

191
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,028
艾琳・麦克纳马拉在会议室里做什么
um-- what's Eileen McNamara doing in the 10:30?

192
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,538
-你需要点什么吗 麦克 -不 我只是好奇
- Do you need something, Mike? - No, just curious.

193
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,808
去别的地方好奇去 我还有事要做呢
Go be curious somewhere else. I got work to do.

194
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,438
-好吧 史蒂夫 再见了 -不送
- Okay, Steve. See ya. - Yeah.

195
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:54,648
看来佩德罗要到九月一号才会重回赛场
And it looks like Pedro's gonna be out till September 1.

196
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,128
吉米说他今年就会重新开始比赛
Jimmy says he'll be back this year,

197
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,478
但医生看起来没那么肯定
but the doc didn't seem so sure.

198
00:09:57,478 --> 00:10:00,018
新英格兰爱国者队的开幕赛是什么时候
When's the Pats opener?

199
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,318
大家都说过了吗
Is that, uh, everyone?

200
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,728
-是的 -好的 谢谢
- Yes, that's it. - Okay. Good. Thank you.

201
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:13,928
大家读过艾琳・麦克纳马拉这周的专栏了吗
Uh, did everyone read Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?

202
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,798
是那个吉欧根的案子吗
That's the geoghan case?

203
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,838
是的 后续报道如何
Yeah. What's the folo on that?

204
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:22,608
那就是个专栏 你想要怎么样的后续报道
It-- it's a column. What kind of folo were you thinking?

205
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,608
额 很显然 三十年来 这位神父
Uh, well, apparently this priest molested kids

206
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,948
在六个不同教区都猥亵过儿童
in six different parishes over the last 30 years,

207
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:30,108
而受害者的律师 额
and the attorney for the victims, Mr., uh--

208
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:32,648
-加拉贝迪安先生 -谢谢 艾琳
- Garabedian. - Thanks, Eileen.

209
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,228
加拉贝迪安先生说劳红衣主教
Mr. Garabedian says cardinal Law

210
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,588
十五年前就发现了他的行径 却无所作为
found out about it 15 years ago and did nothing.

211
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:38,168
我觉得那个律师是个怪人
I think that attorney's a bit of a crank.

212
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,518
教会也否认了这一说法
And the church dismissed the claim.

213
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,988
公说公有理 婆说婆有理
He said, she said.

214
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,358
不管加拉贝迪安先生是不是怪人
Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or not,

215
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,698
他说他有文件可以证明主教知道此事
he says he has documents that prove the cardinal knew.

216
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,328
据我所知 这些文件是密封的
As I understand it, those documents are under seal.

217
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,268
好吧 但事实就是事实 波士顿一位神父虐待八十位儿童
Okay, but the fact remains, a Boston priest abused 80 kids,

218
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:54,968
我们有一位律师声称可以证明劳知道此事
we have a lawyer who says he can prove Law knew about it,

219
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,338
而我们过去六个月里也就写了 两篇报道
and we've written all of, uh, two stories in the last six months.

220
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,708
我认为这个故事对于一个本地报纸来说十分重要
This strikes me as an essential story to a local paper.

221
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:06,318
我想我们至少要浏览一遍那些文件
I think at the very least we have to go through those documents.

222
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,188
你想怎么做呢
How would you like to do that?

223
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,888
额 我不清楚这里的法律
Well, uh, I don't know what the laws are here,

224
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,288
但在佛罗里达 我们会上法庭
but in Florida, we would go to court.

225
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,088
你想要控告教会吗
You want to sue the church?

226
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:18,728
严格来说 我们不会控告教会
Technically, we wouldn't sue the church.

227
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,568
我们只是提出动议 要求公开密封文件
We'd file a motion to lift the seal on those documents.

228
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,998
教会会理解为我们要控告他们
The church will read that as us suing them.

229
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:26,038
大家都会这么认为
So will everybody else.

230
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,538
谢谢告知
Good to know.

231
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,208
-新官上任三把火啊 -这说得真没错
- Gutsy call for the first day. - That's one word for it.

232
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,078
你觉得这会有什么后果
How do you think that's gonna play down front?

233
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,478
我想吉尔曼会很担心
I think Gilman's gonna shit a brick.

234
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:39,978
-嘿 -关门
- Hey. - Door.

235
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,648
怎么样
How'd it go?

236
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:45,558
巴伦想要提出动议 公开吉欧根一案的密封文件
Well, Baron wants to sue for the sealed docs in the Geoghan case.

237
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,528
他想要控告教会吗 嘿 那很好啊
He wants to sue the church? Hey, that's great. Yeah.

238
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:51,558
三年前事发之时 我们报道过吉欧根
We covered Geoghan when the story broke three years ago.

239
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,258
那时巴伦还在迈阿密
Baron was still in Miami.

240
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,428
-其实那时他可能在《时报》 -反正他不在这里
- He might have been at the times then, actually. - He wasn't here.

241
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:59,338
所以你觉得这有希望吗
So do you think that suit has a chance?

242
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:02,338
-要看法官了 -以及他属于哪个教区
- Depends on the judge. - And what parish he belongs to.

243
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,748
布莱德利 嗯
Bradlee. Yeah.

244
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,148
好的
Okay.

245
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:14,078
-巴伦想和我们谈谈 -我们吗
- Baron wants to talk to us. - Us?

246
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,788
-好的 乔 -谢谢
- Okay, Joe. - Thank you.

247
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:19,188
好的 谢谢
Yes. Okay, thanks.

248
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:23,958
我已经定了明天要和外部法律顾问见面
I've set up a meeting for tomorrow with outside counsel.

249
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,858
-乔・阿尔巴诺吗 -是的
- Joe albano? - Yeah.

250
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,768
这个案子的法官是谁
Who's the judge in this case?

251
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,928
额
Um...

252
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,768
康斯坦丝・斯威尼
Constance Sweeney.

253
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:33,368
-难搞的人 -为什么
- Tough. - Why's that?

254
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:36,668
天主教乖乖女
Good catholic girl. Huh.

255
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,878
所以 从我所读到的来说
So, um, judging from what I've read,

256
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,498
看来我们并没有
it doesn't seem like we've done a

257
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,948
十分彻底地调查过吉欧根的案子
very thorough investigation into the Geoghan case.

258
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,378
-是吗 -并不是
- Is that right? - No, it's not.

259
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:49,318
我们很认真地调查过这案子
We looked hard at geoghan.

260
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,488
《都市报》的大卫・阿姆斯特朗 还有宗教记者迈克尔・保尔森
David Armstrong from Metro, Michael Paulson for religion.

261
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,488
好吧 但我了解到
Okay, but, uh, just so I understand,

262
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,958
除了我们的日常报道
beyond our daily coverage, we haven't--

263
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,998
我们还没有对劳主教是否知情一事
we haven't committed any long-term investigative resources

264
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:03,728
展开过任何长期调查
to the question of whether or not cardinal Law knew about this.

265
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,598
是的 没有
No, we haven't.

266
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,838
而这正是你们小组干的事对吗
And that's the kind of thing your team would do?

267
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,608
聚焦吗 嗯 是啊
Spotlight? Well, yeah.

268
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:14,378
但我们还在调查我和你提过的那个波士顿警局的故事
But we're still prospecting the Boston pd story I told you about.

269
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:18,248
-你们可以先把那个放一放吗 -可以
- Could you set that aside? - We could.

270
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,948
马蒂 过去聚焦小组总能成功
Marty, in past spotlight's had success in large part

271
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,588
是因为他们自己挑选想调查的项目
because they pick their own projects.

272
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:29,758
那你们会考虑挑选这个吗
Would you consider picking this one?

273
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,908
我不知道他是不是在写你的事
I don't know if he's writing about you,

274
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,828
但我会告诉他你打过电话
but I will let him know you called.

275
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,298
-好的 拜拜 -嘿
- Okay. Bye. - Hey.

276
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,138
-嘿 怎么样了 -还行吧
- Hey, how'd it go? - Okay.

277
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:43,108
额 巴伦想我们去弄清楚吉欧根的案子
Uh, Baron wants us to scrub the Geoghan case.

278
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,708
-那很好啊 -我们不是报道过吉欧根吗
- That's great. - Didn't we cover geoghan?

279
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,148
是啊 有个律师声称劳主教知情
Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging cardinal law knew about it.

280
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:50,808
-嗯 米奇・加拉贝迪安 是吗 -是的
- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right? - Yeah.

281
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,378
-我在法院那报道过他 -你能联系到他吗
- I covered him at the courthouse. - Can you get to him?

282
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,848
我只采访过他一次 他还有点个性
I only interviewed him once. He's kind of a character.

283
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,488
-我就喜欢有个性的人 我来搞定他 -很好 你负责
- I like characters. I'll take him. - Good. You take him.

284
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,108
还有 我们要找波特一案中的
Also, we should be talking to the

285
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:02,528
受害者代表律师谈谈
lawyer who repped the victims in the Porter case.

286
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,058
-埃里克・麦克利什 -那家伙总上电视
- Eric Macleish. - That guy was always on TV.

287
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:08,128
-波特一案 和我说说 -嗯 额
- The Porter case? Remind me. Yeah, uh--

288
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:09,398
神父波特 相似的故事
father Porter, similar story.

289
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,898
十年前在福尔里弗猥亵了许多儿童
Molested dozens of kids in Fall River about 10 years ago.

290
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,568
-所以我们要放弃波士顿警局的故事吗 -我赞成
- So we're dropping the Boston pd? - I-I vote yes.

291
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,738
不 我们只是暂时将它放一边
No. We just gotta set it aside for now.

292
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,788
不需要我和你们强调了
I don't need to tell you guys this.

293
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,078
我们这次要比平常更加谨慎
We need to be more discreet than usual.

294
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,978
所有人都会对这件事很感兴趣 不仅仅是《先驱报》
Everybody's going to be interested in this, not just the Herald.

295
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,468
在我们掌握有用的信息之前
We can't let cardinal Law

296
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:28,018
不能让劳主教知道半点风声
get wind of this till we know what we have.

297
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,618
祝我们好运吧
Good luck with that.

298
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,728
你什么时候走 奶奶
So when do you leave, Nana?

299
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,858
巴士九点会在教会的停车场接我们
The bus is picking us up in the church parking lot at 9:00.

300
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,398
我们有四十个人要去
We have 40 people going.

301
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,938
-多米尼克神父也去吗 -不 他说他运气不好
- And is father Dominic going? - No. He says he's unlucky.

302
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,838
但这和运气没什么关系
But luck has nothing to do with it.

303
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,638
-你知道吗 上次奶奶赢了一百六十刀 -哇噢
- You know, last time Nana won $160. - Wow.

304
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,548
你要告诉她吗
You gonna tell her?

305
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:56,578
我们还不知道这其中到底有没有料
We don't even know if there's a story yet.

306
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,678
《环球报》控告教会 这本身就是个猛料
Globe sues church? It's gonna be a story.

307
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,908
嘿 丽莎 能把所有相关的剪报都找给我吗
Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the relevant clips on that for me?

308
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,438
好的
Yeah.

309
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,278
是给聚焦的吗
Is this for spotlight?

310
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,378
准备好了就拿过来吧 谢了
Just drop them off when they're ready. Thanks.

311
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,448
不好意思 你知道出版商的办公室在哪吗
Excuse me. Do you know where the publisher's office is?

312
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:34,988
好的
Will do.

313
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,818
你好啊 马蒂
How are you, Marty?

314
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,328
还适应吗
Settling in?

315
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,988
嗯 还行
Yeah, I think so.

316
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,828
很好 有什么能为你效劳吗
Good. What can I do for you?

317
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,998
嗯
Um...

318
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:51,568
我想对吉欧根一案的保护令提出反对
I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.

319
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,668
你想控告天主教会吗
You want to sue the catholic church?

320
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,338
额
Um--

321
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:59,308
我们现在只是提出动议 不过 是的
we're just filing a motion, but, uh, yes.

322
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,578
你觉得真的有这个必要吗
You think it's that important?

323
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,508
是的
Yes, I do.

324
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:07,818
因为教会肯定会十分激烈地反击我们
Because obviously the church will fight us very hard on this.

325
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,588
我们的订阅者也会注意到
Which won't go unnoticed by our subscriber base.

326
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,588
其中百分之五十三都是天主教徒
53% of them are catholic.

327
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,988
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

328
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,028
我想他们会感兴趣的
I think they'll be interested.

329
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,728
好吧
Okay.

330
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,258
马蒂 教会的人可能会
Marty, lake street will probably

331
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:30,368
联系你与主教进行面谈
contact you about a face-to-face with the cardinal.

332
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,538
-这是惯例 -嗯
- It's customary. - Yeah.

333
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:35,578
他们已经找我了 定在下周
They already have. It's set up for next week.

334
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,348
要是我 我就不会提起这件事
I wouldn't mention this.

335
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,958
有人吗
Hello?

336
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,368
有人吗
Hello?

337
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,398
-有什么能帮你的吗 -噢 嗨 我是《波士顿环球报》的麦克・雷赞德斯
- Can I help you? - Oh, hi. I'm Mike Rezendes from the Boston Globe.

338
00:16:58,398 --> 00:16:59,868
我是来见米切尔・加拉贝迪安的
I'm here to see Mitchell Garabedian.

339
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,738
他正在讲电话 先请坐吧
He's on a call. Please have a seat.

340
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,368
好的
Okay.

341
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,048
好了 我在听 继续吧
All right, I'm listening. Go ahead.

342
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,018
好
Okay.

343
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,248
比尔 那些文件死哪去了
Bill! Where the hell are those papers?

344
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,388
我叫你放我桌子上的
I asked you to put 'em on my desk!

345
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:35,568
大名鼎鼎的沃尔特・罗宾森莅临我的会议室
The famous Walter Robinson in my conference room.

346
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,108
很高兴再会 埃里克 萨夏・法伊弗 埃里克・麦克利什
Good to see you again, Eric. Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric macleish.

347
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:41,408
-很高兴认识你 -很高兴认识你 你不打高尔夫吧
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You don't play golf, do you?

348
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,278
-额 不打 -很好
- Uh, no. - Good.

349
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,258
你这位同事去年
Your colleague here took

350
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,178
在一个慈善活动上敲了我一把
some money off me at a charity event last year.

351
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:47,388
那一杆真是走运
It was a very lucky putt.

352
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,418
顺便说一句 其实那时我还是闭着眼的
I actually had my eyes closed, by the way.

353
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,088
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

354
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:53,288
所以有什么可以帮你们的吗
So how can I help you guys?

355
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,428
额 你了解吉欧根那个案子吗
Uh, you're familiar with the geoghan case?

356
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,528
当然 八十个原告
Sure. Eighty plaintiffs.

357
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,598
都是独立的个案
All of them individual cases.

358
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,468
加拉贝迪安都要忙晕了吧
Garabedian must be swimming.

359
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:06,298
是啊 所有指控都指向劳主教吗
Yeah. And the allegations against cardinal Law?

360
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:09,368
是啊 挺棘手的
Yeah, it's tricky. Um--

361
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:12,638
你们要清楚这一点 这些案子都很麻烦
this is what you need to understand. These are shitty cases.

362
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:15,878
嗯 诉讼时效只有三年
Um, the statute of limitations is only three years,

363
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,048
而大部分受害者
and most of these victims

364
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,918
都要很多年后才来寻求法律的帮助
don't come forward till long after that.

365
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:22,318
-噢 为什么 -你知道的 他们都是孩子
- Oh. Why is that? - Well, they're kids, you know.

366
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,048
愧疚感 羞耻感
Uh, guilt, shame.

367
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,988
大部分孩子都来自家教严厉的社区
And most of these kids come from tough neighborhoods.

368
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,158
没人想要承认这种事的发生
Nobody wants to admit this kind of thing.

369
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:31,498
所以在诉讼时效上就已经没辙了
So you're screwed on the time limit.

370
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:35,128
而且 额 就算给你说通了这一点
And, uh, even if you argue your way around that,

371
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:38,568
慈善豁免法令的赔偿金就两万美元
the charitable immunity statute caps damages at 20 grand.

372
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,038
猥亵一个儿童才赔偿两万美元
Twenty grand for molesting a child?

373
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:46,008
是的 这个系统就是这么运转的
That is the way the system is set up, yes.

374
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,678
教会不好对付
The church is tough.

375
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:52,178
所以最好的方法就是让媒体报道这些案子
So your best shot is to try these cases in the press,

376
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,248
就好像在波特一案中我所做的那样
uh, like I did on Porter.

377
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:56,518
-嗯 -但大多数受害者
- Mmm. - But you know, most of the victims,

378
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,588
他们都不想和电视媒体扯上关系
they don't want to have anything to do with TV.

379
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:03,528
还有就是 米奇不算是个好相处的人
And, uh, Mitch isn't exactly a people person.

380
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:04,868
嗯 而且如果加拉贝迪安
Yeah. And if garabedian

381
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,498
没法说服他的受害者接受媒体的报道
can't get his victims to go before the press,

382
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,268
-那他就真的 -没错
- then he's really-- - Yeah, that's right.

383
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:12,038
他接下来的路很漫长啊
He has a long road ahead of him.

384
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,868
我的猜测是他并没有抓到劳的把柄
My guess is he doesn't have anything on Law.

385
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,708
什么 你觉得他只是在吓唬他还是
What? You think he's bluffing or--

386
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,708
我觉得他是故意吹嘘来达成更好的交易
I think he's grandstanding to cut a better deal.

387
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:26,218
看起来有点鲁莽啊
Seems a bit reckless.

388
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:28,888
你们见过米奇・加拉贝迪安吗
Have you met Mitch Garabedian?

389
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:31,218
我叫你起草那个动议 比尔
I asked you to write up that motion, Bill.

390
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:33,188
我没叫你提交
I didn't ask you to file it!

391
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,458
他吗
Mmm?

392
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,768
嘿 比尔
Hey, bill.

393
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,248
嗨
Hi.

394
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,648
-你是谁 -我是《波士顿环球报》的麦克・雷赞德斯
- Who are you? - I'm Mike rezendes from the Boston globe.

395
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,488
我预约了和你一小时前见面的
I had an appointment with you about an hour ago.

396
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,348
我没法和你谈 我很忙 莎伦
I can't talk to you. I'm very busy. Sharon?

397
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,518
她出去买咖啡了 她说她很快回来
She went out for coffee. She said she'd be right back.

398
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,028
我在追踪采访一篇文章
I'm following up on an article.

399
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:11,428
-《凤凰报》那篇吗 -不是 《环球报》那篇
- The one in the Phoenix? - No. In the globe.

400
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,998
-你读了《凤凰报》那篇吗 -还没有
- Did you see the one in the Phoenix? - No, I didn't.

401
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,328
我觉得写得很好 我这好像有一份
I thought it was very good. I have a copy here somewhere.

402
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,368
没事 我晚点再看
That's all right. I'll track it down.

403
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,898
其实我是在追踪采访
I'm actually following up on a

404
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,438
艾琳・麦克纳马拉专栏里报道的关于你那一个诉讼的
column that Eileen McNamara wrote about your suit.

405
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,208
不是一个 有八十四个
Suits. There are 84 of them.

406
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,778
那不是一起集体诉讼 你要补补背景知识
It's not a class action. You should get your facts straight.

407
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,778
你说得对 我应该了解清楚
No, you're right. I should.

408
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,748
我现在只是想问一些背景信息
So I'm trying to get some background information on--

409
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,618
你没在录音吧
you're not recording this, are you?

410
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,948
没有 我不会不经允许就录音的
Uh, no. I wouldn't do that without asking.

411
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,098
我不能给你看教会的文件
I can't show you the church documents,

412
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,948
如果你想要的是这个的话
if that's what you're after.

413
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,518
-它们是密封的 -嗯 我知道
-They're under seal. -Yeah, I know that.

414
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,458
你知道他们三次试图
Did you know they tried to bring me up

415
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,798
在马塞诸塞州律师监督委员会那告发我吗
before the Massachusetts board of bar overseers three times?

416
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,258
-他们盯我盯得很紧 -教会吗
- They're watching me very closely. - The church?

417
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,098
是的 教会
Yeah. The church. Yeah.

418
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:50,858
他们想要取消我的律师资格
They'd like to get me disbarred.

419
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,898
事实上 拿开 把那拿开
In fact-- put that away. Put it away.

420
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,868
-没问题 -我不想你记录这段对话
- Sure. - I don't want you recording this

421
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,538
无论什么形式都不行
in any way, shape or form.

422
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,208
笔录 录音 都不行
Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.

423
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,938
事实上 我可能甚至都不应该和你说话 所以
In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you, so--

424
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:05,378
听着 加拉贝迪安先生 我知道你有东西不能告诉我
look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's things you cannot tell me.

425
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,088
但我也知道这当中有个故事
But I also know there's a story here,

426
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,748
而我觉得这是个很重要的故事
and I think it's an important story.

427

我已经和《凤凰报》谈过了

我知道 我没读那篇文章也是有原因的

现在没人看《凤凰报》了
Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.

430
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,158
它们破产了 它们没什么力量了
They're broke. They don't have any power.

431
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,328
但《环球报》有
The globe does.

432

如果我们报道这个故事 所有人都会知道

教会的力量积攒了无数个世纪 雷赞德斯先生
The church thinks in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.

00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:28,338
你觉得你们报纸有这个资源来担当起这件事吗
Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?

435
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,468
是的 我相信
Yeah, I do.

436
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:34,138
只要你不介意我问你问题
But if you don't mind me asking, do you?

我现在没空和你聊天 雷赞德斯先生
I can't talk to you right now, Mr. Rezendes.

你们在做关于教会的报道吗
Are you guys doing a story on the church?

445
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:53,818
不 我们没在做关于教会的报道
No, we are not doing a story on the church.

他是受害者组织中的成员
He's part of a victims' organization.

叫作斯纳普 这是
It's called snap. It's, uh,

遭神父虐待之苦的受害者群体的缩写
survivors network of those abused by priests.

453
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,138

00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,278
-要我查查他吗 -嗯 好的
- You want me to track him down? - Yeah. Bring him in.

455
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,918
你还需要多长时间看完这些剪报
How much longer you need to get through the clips?

456
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,948
好几天吧 有好多
I mean, a few days. There's a lot.

故技重施 然后又搬走了
Did the same thing and was moved again.

463
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,098
真的吗 听起来和吉欧根的案子很像
Really? That sounds like geoghan.

464
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:39,868
-这是我们的剪报吗 -是啊 署名是迪亚哥・日巴迪内亚 1997年
Is that one of our clips? Yeah. Byline's Diego ribadineira, 1997.

00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,308
肯定是他在做宗教工作之时回来了

是啊 怎么了
Yeah. Why?

看来教会找他帮忙了
Looks like the church brought him in to help out.

老天 除了曼尼还有人把球打出内场吗
Jesus. Has anybody but Manny gotten the ball out of the infield?

472
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:12,738
没有 你怎么在弄那个
Nope. Why do you even bother with that thing?

473
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:14,798
它能让我不去看比赛
It distracts me from the game.

474
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,008
知道还有什么东西能帮到你吗
Know what else is good for that?

-你们有什么进展吗 -当然有
- So, you guys making any progress? - Absolutely.

479
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:30,648
-那是个好故事 -为什么这么说
- It's a good story. - Why?

480
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:33,118
因为你也是一个被教会惹怒的叛教者吗
'Cause you're another lapsed catholic pissed off at the church?

481
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:35,428
-我们找到了很多猛料 -比如说呢

482
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,958
我只是在专心看比赛 什么都听不到
I'm just watching the game. Omerta?

他们找到另一位神父 利亚姆・巴雷特
They got another priest-- Liam Barrett.

我们报道过他 我只是这么一说 我没说错呀
We reported on him. I'm just saying, we did.

485
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,178
好吧 但这个家伙
Okay, but this guy was shuffled

486
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,938
每过几年就换一个教区
around from parish to parish every few years,

487
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,608
就像吉欧根和波特一样
just like geoghan and Porter.

488
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,608
我觉得这有模式可循
I think there's a pattern.

489
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,878
这推测站不住脚 你还发现了什么
Sounds thin. What else you got?

490
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:55,298
萨夏从一个受害者组织里
Sacha's got another guy

491
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,008
找到了一个叫菲尔・萨维亚诺的家伙

是斯纳普组织里的吗 哦 天呐 我们也报道过他
From snap? Oh, boy. We reported on him too.

493
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:03,218
你不是在看球赛吗 史蒂夫
I thought you were watching the game, Steve.

494
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,788
-那家伙被伤得很重 -我们写过几篇他的报道
- That guy's pretty banged up. - We did a couple stories on him.

495
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,458
他一直坚持写信
Guy would not stop writing letters.

496
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,228
-他想发起圣战 -怎么 难道问他没什么意义吗
- He wants a holy war. - What, so he's not worth talking to?

497
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:12,398
-你对加拉贝迪安的调查怎么样了 -还在查呢
- Where are you on garabedian? - I'm working on it.

498
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,958
罗比说麦克利什认为他在虚张声势
Robby says macleish thinks he's bluffing.

499
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:17,128
本 我觉得这里面有料可挖
I think there's something there, Ben.

500
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:19,298
给我点可靠的证据 不然你们就别干了
Get me something solid, or I'm taking you off it.

501
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,808
我不想我们因为这件事瞎忙活
I don't want us chasing our tails on this.

502
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:32,878
不要撞到障碍物
Stay away from that trap!

503
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,418
你想打到那里还早得很呢 伙计
You couldn't reach that trap in a million years, partner.

504
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,488
我以前就打中过
I've reached that trap before.

505
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,318
是么 现在轮到保罗了
Yeah. Now, Paul, maybe.

506
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,358

508
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,728
新编辑怎么样
How's that new editor working out?

509
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,998
呃 他可不怎么喜欢棒球
Well, he doesn't like baseball.

510
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,668
但是 额 他看上去挺聪明的
But, uh, he seems like a smart guy.

511
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:55,538
嗯 我看过一篇关于他的文章
Yeah, I read an article about him.

512
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:59,108
上面说他是《环球报》第一位犹太人编辑
Said he's the first Jewish editor of the globe.

513
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:02,108
真是信息闭塞啊
Must have been a slow news day.

514
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,378
-他结婚了吗 -没有
- He got a family, this guy? - No.

515
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:06,248
他还没结婚
He is not married.

516
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,418
-是离婚了吗 -我觉得不是
- Divorced? - I don't think so, no.

517
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,498
也就是说这位《环球报》的
So the new editor at the

518
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:12,518
新编辑是有着犹太信仰的未婚男人
globe is an unmarried man of the Jewish faith

519
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:14,718
还不喜欢棒球
who hates baseball?

520
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:16,758
-是啊 -这位子应该给本的
- Yeah. - Should have given it to Ben.

521
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,458
他可是布莱德利家的人
He's a bradlee, for crying out loud.

522
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,298
我想 也许是他手举得还不够快吧
Didn't raise his hand fast enough, I guess.

523
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:23,698
嘿 顺便一提
Hey, by the way,

524
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,938
我最近在看那个巴雷特神父的资料
I've been reading about this priest, father Barrett.

525
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,638
上面说你参与过这个案子
Said you were involved with that.

526
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:30,538
巴雷特 哦 坏家伙
Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.

527
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,738
当时教会来找我帮忙 我就参与了
Lake street asked for help. I pitched in.

528
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,098
受害者们说当劳主教
Victim said cardinal law

529
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:37,578
从费城过来的时候就知道巴雷特的事了
knew about Barrett when he came from Philly.

530
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:39,148
这是真的吗
Is that true?

531
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:41,988
你知道我不能谈论这个案子 罗比
You know I can't talk about the case, robby.

532
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:45,258
呃 私下也不行吗
Well... off the record?

533
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:47,818
私底下也不行 我不能说
Off the record, I can't talk about it.

534
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,788
-好吧 -这和诉讼有关系吗
- All right. - This related to the lawsuit?

535
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,398
你知道这回事
You know about that?

536
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,428
听着
Look,

537
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:57,898
我不认识这个叫巴伦的人 也不知道他的计划
I don't know this guy Baron or what his agenda is.

538
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:00,168
坦白说 我也不在乎
Frankly, I don't care.

539
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,738
我只是不想你替他挡子弹
I just don't want to see you taking a bullet for him.

540
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:04,968
我觉得你太过火了
I think you're away.

541
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,248
-放在这儿 -我们走 走
- Put it over here. - Let's go. Let's go.

542
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:16,188
某天我正在上网
So the other day I was on the world wide web.

543
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,658
你想知道的任何事 在网上都找得到
Anything you want to know, it's right there.

544
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:22,028
我不得不承认 身为一个神父
Now, I have to admit that as a priest,

545
00:27:22,028 --> 00:27:24,528
这不免让我感到有些紧张
this makes me a little nervous.

546
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:27,498
我该担心自己的工作保障吗
Should I be worried about job security?

547
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:30,428
我看不需要
I don't think so.

548
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:34,038
你看 知识是一回事
You see, knowledge is one thing.

549
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,708
但信仰就是另一回事了
But faith-- faith is another.

550
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,718
嘿
Hey.

551
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:56,428
嘿
Hey.

552
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:00,228
你不是应该在高尔夫或者别的什么吗
Shouldn't you be golfing or something?

553
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,128
高尔夫可不是个动词
Golfing's not a verb.

554
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,198
我也没有开球时间啊
And I couldn't get a tee time.

555
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,538
人们都是这么称呼的吗 开球时间
Is that what they call it? Tee time?

556
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,038
他们还称它为休闲活动
They also call it a leisure activity.

557
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,538
-你该试试 麦克 -我试了 我去跑步了
- You oughta try it, Mike. - I do. I run.

558
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,538
没错 但你是跑步来上班
Yeah. You run to work.

559
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:18,308
那你今天在这儿做什么
So why are you here today?

560
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:20,918
-在反复看萨维亚诺的剪报 -好吧
- Going over these clips of saviano. - Yep.

561
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:22,478
本和史蒂夫认为这条路走不通
Ben and Steve think it's a dead end.

562
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:24,648
他们在看比赛时说了一堆废话
They gave me a bunch of crap about it at the game.

563
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:26,488
嗯 本给我发了邮件
Yeah, Ben e-mailed me.

564
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,028
-是吗 -嗯
- He did? - Yeah.

565
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:31,588
他说我们该放手了
He said we should let it go.

566
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:33,658
那你想怎么做
What do you want to do?

567
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,868
我想去查一下萨维亚诺
I want to bring saviano in.

568
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:38,328
那你不管这些家伙了吗
So, just ignore those guys?

569
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:44,038
我想我们在这件事上不该理会任何人的话
I think we oughta start ignoring everybody on this one.

570
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,908
这我可以做到
I'm good with that.

571
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,578
那么
Well--

572
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:54,078
你觉得马蒂对这些有什么看法吗
do you think Marty has any idea what's coming down the pike?

573
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:57,188
没有 我也觉得他不在乎
Nope. I don't think he cares either.

574
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:59,258
那可真新鲜
That's refreshing.

575
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:01,358
嗯
Yeah.

576
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,358
除非他错了
Unless he's wrong.

577
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:26,048
我一直都很喜欢报刊业
I've always been fascinated with the newspaper business.

578
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,938
我在哈佛读书的时候曾经也和
I used to sit in on the lectures

579
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,648
内曼兄弟一起上过这样的课程
with the neiman fellows when I was at Harvard.

580
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:34,918
我 额 在文章上看到你曾经也是一个编辑
I, uh-- I read that you were an editor once.

581
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:37,388
啊 是的
Ah, yes.

582
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,928
嗯 那是很久以前的事了
Yeah, that was a very long time ago.

583
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,298
《密西西比报》
The Mississippi register.

584
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,468
主教管区的小报纸
Small diocesan newspaper.

585
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:51,938
但对一位三十岁的牧师来说 也是一份重大的责任啊
But for a 30-year-old pastor, it was a big responsibility.

586
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,638
有时过于沉重了
Too much at times.

587
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,208
怎么说
How so?

588
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,478
我曾和埃弗斯兄弟关系不错
I was close with the evers brothers.

589
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:03,118
我们在公民权利的问题上表明了立场
We took a stand on civil rights.

590
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:06,188
我们的读者不开心了
Our readership was not pleased.

591
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:08,558
他们把我当成瞎插手的局外人
They saw me as a meddling outsider.

592
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,858
我能想象
I can imagine.

593
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:16,528
这位子可不好坐 尤其是在一个小镇子
Tough seat to sit in, especially in a small town.

594
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:20,598
我想你会发现波士顿其实也是个小地方的 马蒂
I think you'll find that Boston's still a small town too, Marty,

595
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,038
从很多方面看都是
in many ways.

596
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,708
嗯
Hmm.

597
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:28,378
但如果有任何地方我能帮得上忙的 马蒂 尽管直说
But if I can be of any help, Marty, don't hesitate to ask.

598
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:31,378
我发现 当一个城市里的各个机构都
I find that the city flourishes

599
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:33,748
齐心协力的时候 这个城市就能变得繁荣
when its great institutions work together.

600
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:36,988
谢谢你
Thank you.

601
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:38,228
就我个人观点来看
Personally I'm of the opinion

602
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,188
一份报纸要能最好地发挥它的功能
that for a paper to best perform its function,

603
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,228
它就不能依靠外在的力量
it really needs to stand alone.

604
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,128
啊 当然了
Ah. Of course.

605
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:50,198
但我的提议仍然有效
But my offer still stands.

606
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,898
谢谢你
Thank you.

607
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,998
请进
Come in.

608
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,738
哦
Ah.

609
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:00,308
谢谢 莫林
Thank you, Maureen.

610
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:04,148
一份小礼物 马蒂
A little gift, Marty.

611
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:09,888
把它当成是红衣主教对波士顿的指引吧
Think of it as a cardinal's guide to the city of Boston.

612
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:28,498
我是来见萨夏・法伊弗的
I'm here to see sacha pfeiffer.

613
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,908
-你的名字是 -菲尔・萨维亚诺
- Your name? - Phil saviano.

614
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:32,738
-好 稍等片刻 -嗯
- Okay, just a minute. - Mm-hmm.

615
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:36,108
我是第一个跟你们交谈的幸存者吗
So, am I the first survivor you've talked to?

616
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:37,748
对的 菲尔 你是第一个
Yeah, Phil, you are.

617
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:39,948
好吧 那么
Okay, well,

618
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:44,288
首先我要感谢你们今天邀请我来
first of all let me say thank you for having me in today.

619
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:45,888
其次 我想知道你们是否
And I want you to know that you

620
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,518
和我所属的斯纳普组织全权合作了
have the full cooperation of my organization, snap.

621
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,628
菲尔 你的组织里有多少人
How many members are in your organization, Phil?

622
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,128
上次开会有十一人
We had 11 at our last chapter meeting--

623
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,628
呃 不 是十个 凯伦离开了
uh, no, um, 10. Karen just moved.

624
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:58,368
-你们团队里还有个女人 -当然了
- You had a woman in your group? - Of course.

625
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,698
他们不会区别对待的 施虐不分男女
They don't discriminate, not when it comes to abuse.

626
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,768
这和是不是同性恋也没关系
And this has nothing to do with being gay.

627
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:05,368
这就是神父利用职权来强奸孩子
What this is is priests using the collar to rape kids.

628
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:07,938
都是孩子啊 有男有女
Kids. Boys and girls.

629
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,718
那时我十一岁
I was 11,

630
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,658
我被伍斯特市的大卫・霍利神父折磨
and I was preyed upon by father David holley in worcester.

631
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,488
我不是说向他祷告 而是受他折磨
And I don't mean prayed for. I mean preyed upon.

632
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:28,258
-你们中有谁是天主教徒吗 -我在信奉天主教的家庭里长大
- Are any of you catholic? - I was raised catholic.

633
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:31,828
不过现在我去我妻子的基督教长老会
Now I go to my wife's presbyterian church.

634
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:33,438
我没有信仰
I'm lapsed.

635
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,508
但我有时和奶奶一起去教堂
I go to church with my grandmother sometimes.

636
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:39,138
之前说我们都在信奉天主教的家庭长大是一件很光荣的事 但现在
It's safe to say we were all raised catholic, but now--

637
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,008
-没这种感觉了 -好吧
- not so much. - Okay.

638
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,008
那么 我告诉你们
Well, let me tell you,

639
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,358
如果你是一个出身贫寒的穷小子
when you're a poor kid from a poor family,

640
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:46,818
宗教就很重要了
religion counts for a lot.

641
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:50,488
而且若是神父能注意到你 那可是非同小可的大事
And when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal.

642
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,818
他会让你收集赞美诗
He asks you to collect the

643
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,288
或者倒垃圾 你会觉得自己是特别的
hymnals or take out the trash, you feel special.

644
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,528
就像上帝让你帮忙一样
It's like god asking for help.

645
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,628
所以当他给你讲黄段子的时候 你可能会觉得有点奇怪
So maybe it's a little weird when he tells you a dirty joke.

646
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:04,268
但你们有了共同的秘密 于是你选择了顺从
But now you got a secret together, so you go along.

647
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:07,668
然后他给你看色情杂志 你也顺从他
Then he shows you a porno mag, and you go along.

648
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,108
就这样 你一直顺从他 听他的话
And you go along, and you go along,

649
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:13,608
直到某天他让你为他打手枪或吹喇叭
until one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow job.

650
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,978
你也会顺从他 因为你觉得非做不可
And so you go along with that too because you feel trapped,

651
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,618
因为他一手栽培了你
because he has groomed you.

652
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:22,118
你怎么能对上帝说不呢 对吧
How do you say no to god, right?

653
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:23,738
你们要理解
See, it is important to

654
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:27,118
这不仅仅是身体上的虐待
understand that this is not just physical abuse.

655
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:29,788
这也是精神上的虐待
It's spiritual abuse too.

656
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:34,798
当一个神父对你做了这些事 他抢劫了你的信仰
And when a priest does this to you, he robs you of your faith.

657
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,998
所以你要么酗酒 要么嗑药
So you reach for the bottle or the needle,

658
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,838
而这些都不起作用时 你就只能纵身跳桥
or if those don't work, you jump off a bridge.

659
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:41,968
这就是我们称自己为幸存者的原因
That's why we call ourselves survivors.

660
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,258
你们读过詹森・内里的书吗
Have you read Jason Berry's book?

661
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:44,968
他写了路易斯安那的高瑟案
He wrote about the gauthe case in Louisiana.

662
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,208
-怎么写 -g-a-u-t-h-e
- That's g-- - g-a-u-t-h-e.

663
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,408
来 去和理查德・赛普谈谈吧
Here. And talk to Richard sipe.

664
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,708
他在教会的其中一间治疗中心工作
He worked in one of the church's treatment centers.

665
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:54,778
他以前是神父 娶了一位修女
He's an ex-priest. Married a nun.

666
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:58,988
这给你 这是科斯案的证词
Here. This is his testimony from the kos case.

667
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:00,558
菲尔 治疗中心是什么
Phil, what's a treatment center?

668
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:02,758
就是当神父被抓到时会被送去的地方
It's where they send priests when they get caught.

669
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:04,008
我知道的都在这盒子里了
This is all here in the box.

670
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,758
我五年前就寄给你们了
I sent this to you guys five years ago.

671
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:09,428
呃 寄给《环球报》吗 你寄给谁了
Uh, to the globe? Who did you send it to?

672
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:13,938
我不想说是谁 但他们表示不感兴趣
I don't wanna say who, but they said they weren't interested.

673
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:17,208
但我们确实做过几篇关于你的报道 我在剪报里看到了
But we did run a couple stories on you. I saw them in the clips.

674
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,678
嗯 可坦白说 那根本不够
Yeah, but to be completely frank, it wasn't enough.

675
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,778
你们要明白
You guys gotta understand.

676
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:26,348
这事关重大
This is big.

677
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:27,698
这不仅关乎波士顿
This is not just Boston.

678
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,218
它关乎整个国家 整个世界
It's the whole country. It's the whole world.

679
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:32,288
它的矛头直指梵蒂冈
And it goes right up to the Vatican.

680
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,458
你有证据吗 菲尔
Do you have any proof of that, Phil?

681
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,958
不 还没 但想想吧 他们数量这么多
No. Not yet. But there are so many of them.

682
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,298
不然他们干嘛要极力隐瞒这么久
How else could they have hidden it for so long?

683
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:42,268
-什么数量那么多 -神父啊
- So many what? - Priests!

684
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:44,428
神父
Priests!

685
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,768
我知道仅波士顿就有十三个
I know of 13 right here in Boston.

686
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:50,468
你知道波士顿有十三个神父对儿童进行性骚扰吗
You know 13 priests in Boston who have molested children?

687
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:53,038
是啊 你为什么要重复我说的每句话
Yeah! Why do you keep repeating everything I say?

688
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:55,408
我只是想确认清楚
I just like to clarify things.

689
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,778
早在五年前我寄给你们这些东西的时候
Maybe you should have clarified

690
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,078
你们就该搞清楚了
it five years ago when I sent you all of this stuff.

691
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:01,378
都在这里面了
It's all right here.

692
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,988
能借用一下洗手间吗
May I use your bathroom?

693
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,558
嗯 好啊 菲尔 走吧
Yeah, sure, Phil. Come on.

694
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:24,168
你们怎么看
Well, what do you think?

695
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:26,678
嗯 这家伙有备而来 这点毫无疑问
Well, the guy's got an agenda, that's for sure.

696
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,738
-你这么认为吗 -他明显经历了很多
- You think? - He's obviously been through a lot.

697
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,608
但他很聪明 而且如果他关于十三个神父的话是对的
But he's smart, and if he's right about 13 priests--

698
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,648
嗯 但我们很难相信这个家伙
yeah, it might be a big "If" With this guy.

699
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,018
调查一下他的背景
Do a background check on him.

700
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,588
追查一下他组织里其它幸存者的情况
And follow up with some of the other survivors of his group.

701
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:38,988
我去找这位前神父 赛普
I'll track down this ex-priest, sipe.

702
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:40,858
好 但也要盯紧加拉贝迪安 那个更重要
Okay, but stay on garabedian. That's more important.

703
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:43,458
啊 加拉贝迪安 真是烦人
Ah. Garabedian. What a pain in the ass.

704
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:46,328
你也可以很烦人 麦克
You can be a pain in the ass, Mike.

705
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:47,898
嗯
Mmm.

706
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:01,338
米切尔 真巧啊 你还好吗
Mitchell, what a surprise. How are you?

707
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,048
-我很好 雷赞德斯先生 -那就好
- I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes. - Good.

708
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:05,608
我还没收到你的回电 我给你留了好多言
I haven't heard back from you. I left you a couple of messages.

709
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:07,818
我特别忙 没什么时间听电话

00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:30,538
更重要 我不懂这是什么意思
Bigger? I don't know what that means.

About an hour.

Um, would you mind if I took some notes? Would that be all right?

我刚有了个孩子
I just had a kid.

745
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:56,058
他才一岁 但我不确定我是否想让他知道这事
He's only one, but I'm not sure I want him to know about this.

746
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:57,988
嗯 我理解
Sure. I get that.

747
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:01,158

748
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,898
好的
Okay. All right.

749
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,668

Go ahead with your notes.

750
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,638

Okay. So, um--

751
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,738

752
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,848

In the projects, over in Hyde park.

他是个十足的人渣
He was a real piece of shit.

763
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,968
我母亲 也不是很稳定
And my mom, she wasn't so stable either.

她有精神分裂症
She was a schizophrenic.

766
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:48,938
都一样不是好人
Same shit.

767
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,718
你第一次遇到吉欧根是什么时候
When did you first meet geoghan?

768
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:58,888
我姐姐 在邓金甜甜圈店里看到他
Well, my sister, she saw him over in the dunkin' donuts.

769
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:01,818
告诉他父亲去世了 他马上赶了过来
Tells him about my old man passing, and he rushed right over.

770
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,238
那个修女 芭芭拉
This nun, sister Barbara,

771
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,898
负责一个组织 专门接收问题家庭来的孩子
ran this group for kids from troubled families.

772
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:08,398
嗯 那个组织在哪里
Mm-hmm. Where was that?

773
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:10,568
额 在多尔切斯特的圣安布罗斯
Uh, St. Ambrose in Dorchester.

774
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:12,368
好的
Okay.

775
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,968
就是她把我介绍给尚利神父的
She's the one who introduced me to father shanley.

776
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:18,408
他是街区的神父
He was a street priest.

777
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:21,338
留长发 很时髦
Long hair. Very hip.

778
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:24,008
他邀我去他后湾区[波士顿上层社会住宅区]的公寓
He invited me to his apartment in back bay.

779
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:26,878
-后湾区哪里 -灯塔街
- Where in back bay? - Beacon street.

780
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,218
-灯塔 好的 -你是本地人吗
- Beacon. Okay. - Are you from here?

781
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:33,058
额 不是的 我在俄亥俄州长大 但我母亲是南方人
Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio, but my mom's from southie.

782
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:36,988
好吧 所以你懂的 我之前从没见过后湾区
All right, so you get it. I'd never even seen back bay.

783
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:41,858
那第一次见面后发生了什么呢 乔
So what happened on that first visit, Joe?

784
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:45,998
呃 一开始他很好 很有趣 也很随意
Well, he was very nice at first, very funny, very casual.

785
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:50,008
我觉得他看得出来我是同性恋
And I think he could tell I was gay,

786
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:53,438
他让我看了他的手机 趴在婴儿床上看的
so he showed me this mobile he had, like over a baby's crib.

787
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:56,848
-嗯 -但是给我看了很多不同的东西
- Mm-hmm. - But with different words.

788
00:39:56,848 --> 00:39:59,878
什么同性恋 跨性别 还有双性恋
"Homosexual." "Transsexual." "Bisexual."

789
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:02,788
嗯 你那时知道自己是同性恋吗 乔
Okay. And did you know you were gay at that time, Joe?

790
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,848
知道
Yeah.

791
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,128
但我没有告诉任何人
But that wasn't information

792
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,288
在多尔切斯特没人知道
I was sharing with anybody. Not in Dorchester.

793
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:11,028
嗯
Okay.

794
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:14,028
他让你看了手机之后呢
So, what happened after he showed you the mobile?

795
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:16,968
呃 我有点被吓到了
Well, I was a little freaked out.

796
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:19,698
我想他看出来了
I think he could tell.

797
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,338
于是他说 你知道吗 我们来玩脱衣扑克会好一点哦
So he said, you know, what'll help is if we play strip poker.

798
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:26,778
毫无疑问我输了
Of course I lost.

799
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,148
然后 额 事情就发生了
And, uh, things went on from there.

800
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:33,718
你能给我讲讲细节吗
Can you tell me specifically what happened?

801
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:37,388
细节就是 他
Specifically, he--

802
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,118
他对我性骚扰
he molested me.

803
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:46,498
乔 我想这时候我们要很注意用语
Joe, I think that the language is gonna be so important here.

804
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:49,928
我们不能美化这件事 只说“性骚扰”是不够的
We can't sanitize this. Just saying "Molest" Isn't enough.

805
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:52,898
人们得知道究竟发生了什么
People need to know what actually happened.

806
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:58,338
-我们应该把这些打包带走 -是的
- We should probably get these to go. - Right.

807
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:02,178
吉欧根来了 我母亲 你知道 她
Geoghan shows up, and my mom, you know, she's--

808
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:03,848
她很激动
she's thrilled.

809
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:07,118
我是说 就像看到上帝似的 你懂吧
I mean, this was like god showing up, you know?

810
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:09,988
嗯 之后发生什么了呢
Sure. Right. So what happened then?

811
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:14,518
你真的要听这些破事吗
You really want to hear this shit?

812
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:17,088
对 帕特里克 我要听
Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.

813
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:27,698
他说带我去吃冰激凌
He offers to take me to get ice cream.

814
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,938
你知道的 他是神父 我是小孩 所以我就去了
You know, he's a priest, I'm a kid, so I go.

815
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:32,708
嗯
Sure.

816
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,078
然后我们开车回家
So we're driving home and he--

817
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:40,018
他开始轻拍我的腿
he starts patting my leg and--

818
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,248
然后
you know, then...

819
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:47,988
他的手就滑过来了
His hand just slides right up and he--

820
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,228
然后抓住我的性器
he grabs my dick.

821
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:52,728
你知道吗 我都呆住了
You know, I-- I just froze up.

822
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:55,958
我完全吓呆了 动弹不得
I was fucking petrified. I-I couldn't move.

823
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:58,968
我不知道怎么办 那时我还是个孩子
I didn't know what to do. I was just a little kid.

824
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,298
嗯
Yeah.

825
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:08,908
你知道 我压根都没吃到冰激凌
You know, I never even touched my ice cream.

826
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:11,308
它就在我手里融化了
It just melted down my arm.

827
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,248
那你 额
Did you, um--

828
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:23,288
那以后你还有见他吗
did you see him again after that?

829
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:29,828
嗯
Yeah.

830
00:42:32,568 --> 00:42:36,368
好了 可以了 这次就先说这么多吧
All right. That's good. Let's stop there for now.

831
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,738
好
Sure.

832
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:40,938
他说这样做能让我更适应自己的身体
He said it was a way to make me more comfortable with my body.

833
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:43,848
嗯 那这之后呢
Mmm. So what happened after that?

834
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:46,618
嗯 他脱下自己的衣服说
Well, he took off his clothes and he said,

835
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:48,248
“我一直以来都很压抑
"I've been so depressed,

836
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:51,348
但也许你能让我开心点 帮我吹喇叭”
but maybe you can cheer me up and give me a blow job."

837
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,018
真是谦谦君子
Classy guy.

838
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:56,488
-那你照做了吗 -我做了
- And did you? - Yeah.

839
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:59,528
我想你肯定在想
I know you must be thinking,

840
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,818
为什么我会为一个比我
why would I ever do that to

841
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:02,968
大三十岁的奇葩做这种事
some creepy guy who's 30 years older than me?

842
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:04,748
但你要明白
But what you have to understand

843
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,098
这是我人生中第一次
is that this is the first time in my life

844
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:09,708
有人告诉我同性恋并没有什么错
that someone told me that it was okay to be gay.

845
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,568
-而且他还是一个神父 -嗯
- And it was a priest. - Right.

846
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:14,708
所以你为他口交了
So you had oral sex.

847
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,208
你们有过性行为吗
Did you have intercourse?

848
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,748
有
Yes.

849
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:20,948
不是当时 是后来
Not then, but later.

850
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:24,148
那让我痛苦了很久
It really messed me up.

851
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:28,988
我现在清醒了 但那 那就是一切的开始
I'm sober now, but that-- that was the beginning of it all.

852
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:33,998
那让我十分困惑 你懂吧
It's very confusing, you know,

853
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:37,168
通过这种方式了解性是什么
to be introduced to sex like that and then--

854
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:39,568
然后喜欢上男人 实在是
and then to be attracted to men, it's--

855

他是其中的幸运儿
He's one of the lucky ones.

868
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:23,608

Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.

873
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:49,298
你向菲尔・萨维亚诺说过这些 是吗
You talked to Phil saviano about all of this, right?

874
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:51,668
嗯 是的 我去过几次斯纳普的会议
Yeah, I did. I went to a couple of snap meetings.

875
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:54,738
菲尔有没有建议你采取一些措施呢
And did Phil ever suggest you do anything about it?

876
00:44:54,748 --> 00:44:57,648
没有 会议也不是关于这些的
No. The meetings weren't really about that.

877
00:44:57,648 --> 00:44:59,588
其中一些人找了律师
A couple of them had gone to a lawyer,

878
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,378
但我觉得不值得
but I didn't think it was worth it.

879
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,018
为什么
Why not?

880
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:05,848
去那里要填很多表 太耗费时间精力了
There were just so many forms to fill out. It was overwhelming.

881
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,418
他说最多也只能为我争取到一点赔偿 所以
And he said he could only get me a small settlement, so--

882
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:11,158
-谁说的 -那个律师说的
- wh-who said that? - The lawyer told me that.

883
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,158
所以你是有去见过律师
So you did go and see a lawyer?

884
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,248
嗯 但最后还是没有用
Yeah, but I didn't end up using him,

885
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,268
所以我想这个也不重要吧
so I didn't think it was important.

886
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,598
抱歉 我没有要隐瞒的意思
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hide anything.

887
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:23,268
不 我知道的 乔
No, I-I-I know, Joe.

888
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,838
你还记得那个律师的名字吗
Do you remember his name? The lawyer?

889
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:28,708
不 但菲尔可能会知道
No. But maybe Phil would know.

890
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,948
他在波特案时经常出镜 长得也很帅
The guy was on TV a lot during the Porter case. He was handsome.

891
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:34,518
是埃里克・麦克利什吗
Was it Eric macleish?

892
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:37,048
嗯 就是他 麦克利什
Yeah, that's it. Macleish.

893
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,088
我觉得他很帅
I thought he was very handsome.

894
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:43,758
-嗨 -嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

895
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:45,028

Canellos started a pool. Ten bucks to get in.

900
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:55,468
有人买《环球报》赢吗
Anyone picking the globe?

901
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:57,768
他坐的庄是斯威尼要用多久来否决我们
He's only taking bets on how fast sweeney rules against us.

902
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,208
罗比
Robby.

903
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,878
-收到我的留言了吗 -收到了

Looks like father shanley could be our fourth priest.

905
00:46:05,118 --> 00:46:06,748
嗯 我想是的
Yeah, I think he is.

906
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,478
-你追查麦克利什了吗 -我刚刚和菲尔谈过了
- Did you follow up with macleish? - I just talked to Phil.

907

他说麦克利什处理了很多这种案子
He said macleish dealt with a number of these cases.

908
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:14,288
-看来他忘记说了 -嗯

909
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,288
明天我要去法庭
I'm gonna go to the courthouse tomorrow,

910
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:18,958
看看能不能找到他经手的起诉教会的案子
see if I can find any cases he settled against the church.

911
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,258

- Geez. Does that guy ever go home? - Apparently not.

917
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,948
还有些人不坐穿编辑室的椅子
I got guys who won't leave till he does.

918
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:40,778

He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.

922
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,028

-你的料从哪来的 -菲尔・萨维亚诺

924

00:46:56,738 --> 00:46:58,498
-麦克那家伙可是 -我知道 我知道
- Mike that guy's a fuckin'-- - I know, I know.

926
00:46:58,498 --> 00:47:00,868
我觉得萨维亚诺可能是可信的 本
I think saviano might be legit, Ben.

927
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:03,768
想给我解释一下吗
Want to elaborate on that?

928
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:06,038
不 还不行
No. Not really.

929
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:09,578
只是觉得事情仿佛越发复杂了 我的直觉
It just feels like this thing's stacking up. That's my gut.

930
00:47:12,648 --> 00:47:14,678

936
00:47:31,738 --> 00:47:33,998
噢 嗨 理查德 你还好吗
Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard. How are you?

937
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,798
-我很好 -额 谢谢你打电话过来

Look, uh, Phil saviano g-gave me your name.

939
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:41,238
我在想能不能问你几个问题

940
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:42,738
-当然可以 -好极了
- Of course. Yeah. - Great.

941
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:45,478
菲尔说你以前在一个巴尔的摩的
Uh, so Phil told me that you were working

942
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:48,748
一个教会治疗中心工作
a-at one of the church's treatment centers in Baltimore.

943
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:51,588
是的 西顿精神科研究所
Yes. The seton psychiatric institute.

944
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:53,588
由仁爱修女会运营
It was run by the daughters of charity.

945
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:57,058
那是什么时候 理查德
And, uh, when was that, Richard?

946
00:47:57,058 --> 00:48:01,558
我1965年加入了这个研究所
Well, I started my psychotherapy fellowship there in 1965,

947
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:03,728
-恩 -我在那里呆了五年
- okay. - And I was there for five years,

948
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,138
但接下来我花了三十年
but I spent the next 30

949
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:07,768
研究性侵别人的神父和那些受害者
studying abusive priests and their victims.

950
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:09,268
-真的吗 -恩
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

951
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:11,368
所以你一直关注的就只有这个吗
And that's-- that's been your sole focus?

952
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:13,228
听着 麦克 教会想让
Look, Mike, the church wants

953
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:16,278
大家觉得里面只有几只害群之马
us to believe that it's just a few bad apples.

954
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:18,248
但这只是冰山一角
But it's a much bigger problem than that.

955
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,048
问题有多严重 理查德
How much bigger, Richard?

956
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:22,078
根据我的调查
Well, based on the research,

957
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:25,848
我将它归为一种可识别的精神现象
I would classify it as a recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.

958
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,658
可真是大问题啊
That's big.

959
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:35,128
-嘿 麦可 -嘿
- Hey, Mac. - Hey.

960
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,178
如果我想要一个神父的历史资料
If I wanted historical data on a priest,

961
00:48:37,178 --> 00:48:38,768
想知道他所分配的教区
parishes he's been assigned to,

962
00:48:38,768 --> 00:48:40,238
我在哪里可以找到这些资料
where would I find that?

963
00:48:40,238 --> 00:48:41,858
吉欧根那件案子吗 都在那些剪报里
The geoghan case? It's all in the clips.

964
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:43,038
丽莎有资料
Lisa has the source material.

965
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:44,488
如果是另一个神父呢
What if it was for another priest,

966
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,968
没有上过报纸的
one that hadn't been in the papers?

967
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:48,878
你在找另一个神父 谁啊
You're looking at another priest? Who you looking at?

968
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:50,448
有办法吗
Any ideas?

969
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:53,248
拜托 马特 你不打算告诉我吗
Come on, Matt. You're not gonna tell me?

970
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:55,678
我要去开会了 谢谢你 麦可 你好啊 史蒂夫
I gotta get to a meeting. Thanks, Mac. Hey, Steve.

971
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,658
总教区出版了年度名录
The archdiocese puts out an annual directory,

972
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:00,958
每个神父和教区都有记录
every priest and parish.

973
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,488
好极了
That's great.

974
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,728
有98年以前的吗
Do these go back any further than '98?

975
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:06,998
恩 一直到八十年代
Oh, yeah. Going back to the '80s in the mez.

976
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:08,628
更早以前的话 你得去波士顿公共图书馆了
Beyond that, you gotta go to bpl.

977
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,228
-谢了 丽莎 -不客气
- The mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa. - You bet.

978
00:49:12,338 --> 00:49:14,968
他说他们的目标是同一种孩子
He said they all target the same kind of kid.

979
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:18,668
家庭收入低 没有父亲 家庭支离破碎
Low-income families, absentee fathers, broken homes.

980
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:19,698
因此吉欧根这种人
So a guy like geoghan

981
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,838
找上这些男孩不是因为他偏爱他们
goes after boys not because he prefers them,

982
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,608
而是因为这些男孩更懂羞耻 不喜欢说话
but because they have more shame, less likely to talk.

983
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:26,278
恩
Hmm.

984
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:27,948
-这些人就是禽兽 罗比 -嗯
- These guys are predators, robby. - Yeah.

985
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,518
我和赛普谈过了
I-I-I talked to sipe.

986
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,448
他说在六十年代的西顿研究所见过许多这样的神父
He said he's seen dozens of them in the '60s in seton.

987
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,118
他称之为一种“现象”
He called it a "Phenomenon."

988
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:35,858
-他为什么没有揭示于众 -他有
- Why didn't he go public? - He did.

989
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:38,488
但教会竭力败坏了他的名声
But the church made a huge effort to discredit him.

990
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:41,658
恶意宣传 有威望的主教还发表公开声明
Smear campaigns, public statements by prominent bishops.

991
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:44,528
就像萨维亚诺和加拉贝迪安说的一样
It's just like saviano said. And garabedian.

992
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:47,668
-你有什么进展吗 -找到更多的受害者
- You getting anywhere with him? - More victims.

993
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,838
更多的受害者 你没有问到底吗
More victims. You can't empty his pockets?

994
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,038
我会尽力的 但是要更多时间
I'll get to him. I just need more time.

995
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:53,938
拜托了 麦克 你得搞定他
Come on, Mike. You gotta get him.

996
00:49:53,938 --> 00:49:55,708
我会的 我会的
I'll get him. I'll get him.

997
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:00,178
天呐 这是什么怪味
Jesus. What the hell is that smell?

998
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:02,618
角落里有一只死老鼠
There's a dead rat in the corner.

999
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:04,448
-你找到了什么 -教会的名录
- What have you got? - Church directories.

1000
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,418
上面有马萨诸塞州每个神父的名字
It's every priest in Massachusetts,

1001
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:08,218
还有他们所在的教区
what parish they're assigned to.

1002
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:10,728
-是官方资料吗 -恩 我觉得可以在里面
- Are these official? - Yeah. I figured it could help us track down

1003
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:12,428
找到一些萨维亚诺提到过的神父
some of the priests saviano mentioned,

1004
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:13,728
也许能找到更多的受害者
maybe find some more victims.

1005
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:15,898
-能开点灯吗 -我找不到开关
- Can we turn on some more lights? - I couldn't find the switch.

1006
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:18,228
-你要我的眼镜吗 -不 不用
- You wanna borrow my glasses? - No, I'm good. I'm good.

1007
00:50:18,238 --> 00:50:19,998
看 1983年
Look. 1983.

1008
00:50:19,998 --> 00:50:22,898
约翰・吉欧根 多切斯特圣布兰登街教区
John geoghan, St. Brendan's parish, Dorchester.

1009
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:25,368
我们可以找到任何一年的任何神父吗
So we can find out where any priest is in any given year?

1010
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:28,138
恩 我找到了
Yeah, I got him here at--

1011
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:30,248
-哈 -什么
- huh. - What?

1012
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:32,378
1980年 吉欧根从教区离职
1980. The year geoghan was pulled from jp.

1013
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:34,218
上面说他在休病假
It says he's on sick leave.

1014
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:36,318
不会吧 真的吗
Come on. It really says that?

1015
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:40,088
1991年的在哪里
Where is, uh, 1991?

1016
00:50:40,088 --> 00:50:41,758
这里
Yeah. Here ya go.

1017
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:44,228
我看看利亚姆・巴雷特
Let me see this. Barrett. Barrett. Liam.

1018
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:46,928
我看不清 帮我找找利亚姆・巴雷特
I can't read that. Look for a Liam Barrett in there.

1019
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:50,398
1991年他从查尔斯顿离职
1991's the year they pulled him out of charlestown.

1020
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:53,538
“利亚姆・巴雷特”
"Barrett, Liam."

1021
00:50:53,538 --> 00:50:55,998
-恩 -“休病假”
- Yeah. - "Sick leave."

1022
00:50:57,108 --> 00:50:59,068
这是官方说法
It's an official designation.

1023
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:02,778
把这些拿到楼上
Let's get these upstairs.

1024
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:05,108
马特 你查查看萨维亚诺告诉我们的神父
Matt, check on those priests saviano gave us.

1025
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:07,618
-我是罗比 -我在法庭
- Robby. - I'm down at the courthouse.

1026
00:51:07,618 --> 00:51:09,378
有点不对劲
Something's not right here.

1027
00:51:09,388 --> 00:51:12,118
-尚利的也没有 萨夏 -好的 谢谢
- Nothing on shanley either, sacha. - Okay, thanks.

1028
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:15,718
-我们得再找麦克利什谈话 -真的吗 为什么
- Um, we need to talk to macleish again. -Really. Why?

1029
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:19,428
这里什么也没有 任何记录都没有
Huh? There's nothing here. There aren't any records.

1030
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:26,898
多谢等待 抱歉伙计们 我一直在接电话
Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys. Stuck on a call.

1031
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:28,798
-没事 你怎么样 -很好
- Not a problem. How are you? - Good.

1032
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:30,768
-谢谢和我们会面 -应该的 什么事
- Thanks for meeting us. - You bet. What's up, guys?

1033
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:34,608
麦克利什先生 你认识一个叫保罗・尚利的神父吗
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar with a priest named Paul shanley?

1034
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:37,478
恩 我认识
Yes, I am familiar with him.

1035
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:42,078
你有处理过尚利神父的案子吗
And have you settled cases against father shanley?

1036
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:46,718
你们能理解的 我不能告诉你们
As I'm sure you can understand, I can't discuss that with you.

1037
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:50,758
恩 那罗纳德・帕奎因神父呢
Yeah, h-how about, uh, father Ronald paquin?

1038
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:55,758
我也不能告诉你们 拜托了
Well, I can't discuss that with you either. Come on, guys.

1039
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:58,468
我们知道你帮他们处理过几场官司
We understand you've settled several cases against each of them.

1040
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:01,498
即使我是有参与这些官司
Even if I'd been involved in those cases,

1041
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:03,308
调解结果也是保密的
the settlements would be confidential

1042
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:06,408
如果我说出来的话 会被取消律师资格
and I could be disbarred for acknowledging their existence.

1043
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:09,408
-好吗 -恩
- Okay? - Mm-hmm.

1044
00:52:09,408 --> 00:52:11,578
听着 我说过这些案子很棘手
Look, I told you guys these are tough cases.

1045
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:15,948
大多数人只想他们承认
Most of these folks, they just want some acknowledgment

1046
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,688
发生了什么事情
of what happened.

1047
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,358
让他们和主教坐下来 拿点钞票
We got 'em a sit-down with the bishop and a little dough,

1048
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,258
这是最好的结果了
and that's the best they could hope for.

1049
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:27,198
当然了 这是神父所期待的最好结果
Well, it's certainly the best the priests could hope for.

1050
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,408
不 教会保证了
No, the church promised

1051
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:30,668
他们会开除这些神父
they'd take the priests out of circulation.

1052
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:33,598
你有后续跟进吗
And did you follow up on that?

1053
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,968
你们还有什么事吗
Do you guys need anything else?

1054
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:42,878
有 为什么没有任何记录
Yes. Why aren't there any records?

1055
00:52:42,878 --> 00:52:44,978
我之前在法庭
I was down at the courthouse earlier.

1056
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:47,118
那里没有任何关于这些调解结果的记录
There aren't any records of any of these settlements.

1057
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:51,688
我们直接和教会沟通的
We dealt directly with the church.

1058
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:57,858
我们起草一份交款通知书 送到了主教办公室
We would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery.

1059
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:01,398
-你没在法院上提交过任何文件吗 -这是私人调解
- You never filed anything in court? - It's a private mediation.

1060
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:04,068
那么 这只是
So, this is just you

1061
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:08,668
你和总教区的律师在操作吗
and the archdiocese's lawyers in a room?

1062
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:11,338
-是的 -还有其他人吗
- Correct. - Anyone else?

1063
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:12,788
有时候教会会请
Occasionally the church would

1064
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:15,078
其他辩护律师来帮忙
bring in another defense attorney to help out.

1065
00:53:15,078 --> 00:53:16,948
你知道他们的名字吗
You have names?

1066
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:20,218
不 我不知道
Nope. No, I don't.

1067
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:23,218
那这一切都是私下操纵咯
So this was all under the table?

1068
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:25,248
根本没有文件可循
There's no paper trail at all.

1069
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:26,278
为了达成私下和解
The victim has to sign a

1070
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,318
受害者不得不签保密协议
confidentiality agreement to get the settlement.

1071
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:31,358
律师作为第三方 然后教会隐瞒真相
The lawyer takes a third, and the church sweeps it under the rug.

1072
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,258
-这完全是非法的啊 -事情还要更复杂
- It's a freakin' racket. - It's more complicated than that.

1073
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:35,478
麦克利什有责任
Macleish has got a duty

1074
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,698
让客户得到最好的结果
to the client to get the best deal he can.

1075
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,208
当然 但他们要代表多少受害者
Sure. But how many victims do you

1076
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,538
从中获取多少利益才能出手帮忙
represent and profit from before you say something?

1077
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,668
加拉贝迪安会说一个也没有
Garabedian would say none.

1078
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,708
这就是为什么他要把这些案子送上法庭
That's why he's taking these cases to court.

1079
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:48,238
-他想要人们知道这件事 -我同意
- He wants people to know about this. - I agree.

1080
00:53:48,248 --> 00:53:50,408
本 先把法律道德放一边
And legal ethics aside, Ben,

1081
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:52,248
像麦克利什这样的处理方式
I mean, operating the way macleish has

1082
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:55,778
只会让这些侵害案件不为人知
all but guarantees that the abuse stays under wraps.

1083
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:58,888
恩 麦克利什确认了萨维亚诺说的那些神父吗
Yeah. Did macleish confirm all saviano's priests?

1084
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:03,628
没有 他受到了保密协议的限制
No. He's limited by his confidentiality agreement.

1085
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,628
但他显然调解了很多神父的案子
But clearly he's settled cases against a number of them.

1086
00:54:06,628 --> 00:54:08,958
菲尔让我联系到了一些其他受害者
Phil's put me in touch with some of the other victims.

1087
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,528
我相信能找到所有神父
I'm pretty confident all of his priests are gonna check out.

1088
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,038
所以是有十三个神父吗
So it is 13 priests?

1089
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:16,808
-恩 -看起来是这样
- Yeah. - Looks that way.

1090
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:18,868
天呐
Holy shit.

1091
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,608
好的 继续努力
Okay. Keep going.

1092
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:28,948
抱歉 你叫什么
I'm sorry. What was the name again?

1093
00:54:29,888 --> 00:54:31,718
额 巴伦
Uh, baron.

1094
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:35,818
B-a-r-o-n
B-a-r-o-n.

1095
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:38,988
我没找到 等一会儿
I'm having trouble finding it. Just give me a second.

1096
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:41,458
没事了 金姆 我为他担保
It's okay, Kim. I can vouch for him.

1097
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:44,398
我是皮特・康利 天主教慈善会的董事
I'm Pete conley. I'm on the board of catholic charities.

1098
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:46,098
欢迎来到波士顿 巴伦先生
Welcome to Boston, Mr. Baron.

1099
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:48,838
-谢谢 -感谢你加入我们
- Thank you. - I appreciate you joining us.

1100
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,568
我们对在波士顿所做的工作感到很自豪
We're very proud of the work we do here in Boston.

1101
00:54:52,578 --> 00:54:55,338
主教说你之前跟他见过面 聊得挺愉快的
Oh, the cardinal said you had a nice visit.

1102
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:57,008
是的 没错
Yes, we did.

1103
00:54:57,008 --> 00:55:01,248
他是个很了不起的人 很高兴你们有机会能一起谈话
He's an extraordinary man. I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

1104
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:16,528
玩得开心吗
Enjoying yourself?

1105
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:20,998
老实说 我不太擅长参加这些活动
Uh, to be honest, these events aren't really my strong suit.

1106
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:23,938
-恩 -你参加了慈善会吗
- Yeah. - Are you involved with the charity?

1107
00:55:23,938 --> 00:55:26,438
没有 我有些朋友参加了
Not directly, no. Several of my friends are.

1108
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:29,008
我们都读的波士顿天主教高中
We all went to high school at bc high.

1109
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:31,648
就在《环球报》的对面
That's the school across the street from the globe.

1110
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:33,748
-很容易看到嘛 -恩
- It's hard to miss. - Yeah.

1111
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,378
而且逃课还很容易被抓到
Hard to get away from too, apparently.

1112
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:42,158
如果你想见红衣主教的话
The, uh, cardinal's in the corner,

1113
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:43,728
他就在那边
if you're so inclined.

1114
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:45,828
-我们见过了 -真的吗
- We've met. - Really?

1115
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,058
他有提到起诉吗
Did he mention the suit?

1116
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:51,068
没有 但他给了我一本《教义问答书》
No, but he did give me a copy of the catechism.

1117
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:52,368
好吧
Yeah.

1118
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:54,838
他的精明并不是众人皆知的
Well, the cardinal's not known for his subtlety.

1119
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:56,568
在调查波特的时候
During the Porter investigation,

1120
00:55:56,568 --> 00:56:00,408
他真的借用了神的力量对《环球报》进行压制
he literally called down the power of god on the globe.

1121
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:02,138
此话怎讲
How'd that play out?

1122
00:56:02,148 --> 00:56:05,878
一周后 我们的编辑在滑雪时摔断了腿
A week later, our editor broke his leg skiing.

1123
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,978
要鲜虾吐司吗 先生们
Shrimp toast, gentlemen?

1124
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,118
-不 谢谢 -谢谢
- Uh, no, thanks. - Thanks.

1125
00:56:12,388 --> 00:56:16,488
你说有个受害人提起了刑事诉讼吗
You said one of the victims filed a criminal complaint?

1126
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:19,258
恩 有一些
Yeah, there were a few of them.

1127
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:21,098
但是教会的同伴起诉后
But the judge had the case records sealed

1128
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:23,228
法官就密封了案件记录
after friends of the church complained.

1129
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:25,328
而且教会的人脉众多
And the church has a lot of friends.

1130
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,768
比如埃里克・麦克利什吗
Like Eric macleish?

1131
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,768
恩
Yeah.

1132
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,768
我只能说他嘴太严了 我们得找别的方法
Let's just say he's not part of the solution.

1133
00:56:32,778 --> 00:56:34,938
-你听懂我的意思了吗 -当然
- You follow what I'm saying? - Sure.

1134
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:36,948
你工作真卖力 雷赞德斯先生
You work hard, Mr. Rezendes.

1135
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:39,848
-你结婚了吗 -恩
- Are you married? - Yeah.

1136
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:41,428
你妻子不介意你
Your wife doesn't mind you

1137
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:43,918
-整天工作吗 -噢 她介意
- working all the time? - Oh, yeah, she does.

1138
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:48,788
这就是为什么我没有结婚 我太忙了
That's why I never got married. I'm too busy.

1139
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:51,128
我的工作太重要了
What I do is too important.

1140
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:52,858
恩
Mmm.

1141
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,628
你们的新编辑是个犹太人 对吗
Your new editor, he's a Jew, right?

1142
00:56:57,628 --> 00:56:59,298
恩 是的
That's right. Yeah.

1143
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:01,298
你看 他一进来
Well, see, he comes in

1144
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,808
大家突然都对教会有了兴趣
and suddenly everybody's interested in the church.

1145
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:05,968
你知道为什么吗
You know why? Mmm.

1146
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:09,578
因为他是旁观者清 跟我一样
Because it takes an outsider, like me.

1147
00:57:09,578 --> 00:57:11,278
我是亚美尼亚人
I'm Armenian.

1148
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,348
你认识多少在波士顿的亚美尼亚人
How many Armenians do you know in Boston?

1149
00:57:14,618 --> 00:57:16,548
史蒂夫・柯吉恩 在《环球报》上班
Steve kurkjian. Works at the globe.

1150
00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:20,818
噢 你认识两个了 真该给你颁个奖
Oh. That's two. You should get a prize or something.

1151
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:24,128
-你是哪里人 意大利人吗 -不 我是葡萄牙人
- What are you, Italian? - No, I'm Portuguese.

1152
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:27,328
-哪里来的 -波士顿东区
- From where? - Uh, east Boston.

1153
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,328
真的吗 波士顿东区
Really? East Boston?

1154
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:34,498
你口音听起来不像啊
You don't sound like it.

1155
00:57:40,678 --> 00:57:45,178
这座城市 这些人
This city, these people--

1156
00:57:45,178 --> 00:57:47,848
让我们这些外来人觉得没有归属感
making the rest of us feel like we don't belong.

1157
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:50,178
但他们并不比我们优秀
But they're no better than us.

1158
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:52,318
看看他们如何对待孩子的吧
Look at how they treat their children.

1159
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:56,288
记住我的话 雷赞德斯先生
Mark my words, Mr. Rezendes,

1160
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:58,688
环境可以塑造一个孩子
if it takes a village to raise a child,

1161
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:01,458
也可以毁了一个孩子
it takes a village to abuse one.

1162
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:06,528
嘿 你来了
Hey, here he is.

1163
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:08,698
-要喝酒吗 -乐意之至
- Want a beer? - Love one.

1164
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,198
再来一杯
Another.

1165
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,538
-和芭芭拉一起来的吗 -不 她不喜欢来这些地方
- You here with Barbara? - No, no. She hates these things.

1166
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:14,808
凯伦也是
Karen too. Yeah.

1167
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:16,378
女人真聪明
Smart ladies.

1168
00:58:16,378 --> 00:58:17,948
-干杯 -干杯
- Slente. - Slente.

1169
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:21,878
我见到了你的新编辑
Mmm. I met your new editor.

1170
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,618
看起来是个不错的人
Seemed like a decent fellow.

1171
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:25,288
我觉得是的
I think he is.

1172
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:29,858
嘿 前些天我和埃里克・麦克利什
Hey, I had an interesting conversation

1173
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:31,988
谈了一些有趣的东西
with Eric macleish the other day.

1174
00:58:31,998 --> 00:58:33,978
原来多年来他一直
Turns out he's been settling

1175
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:37,028
在帮总教区调解性侵儿童案
abuse cases with the archdiocese for years.

1176
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:40,368
你真的想在这里谈这个吗
You really want to talk about this here?

1177
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:46,468
吉姆 你说你帮了巴雷特神父当是人情
Jim, you said you helped out on father Barrett as a favor.

1178
00:58:46,478 --> 00:58:48,308
只有那一次吗
That was a one-off?

1179
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:55,218
你还参与了多少件案子
How many of these cases you been involved with?

1180
00:58:55,218 --> 00:58:57,988
你知道我不能回答 罗比 这是违反职业道德的
You know I can't answer that, robby. It's unethical.

1181
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:00,958
真的仅仅因为这个吗
Is that all it is?

1182
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:07,398
这就是我一直有所耳闻
So, this would be the robby Robinson

1183
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:09,758
但却素未谋面的罗比・罗宾森
I've always heard about but never met.

1184
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:11,428
哈
Huh?

1185
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,738
听我说 吉米
Listen to me, Jimmy.

1186
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:15,898
你得选对边
You want to be on the right side of this.

1187
00:59:17,938 --> 00:59:20,778
你说的可是教会啊 罗比
This is the church you're talking about, robby.

1188
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:22,738
看看四周 他们都是好人
Look around. These are good people.

1189
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:24,848
为这座城市做了很多好事
Done a lot of good for this city.

1190
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:27,978
你就好好玩吧
Enjoy the party.

1191
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:39,028
我现在看了很多名录
I've been through a lot of these now.

1192
00:59:39,028 --> 00:59:40,728
他们将这些神父开除时
"Sick leave" Isn't the only designation they use

1193
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:42,958
不光会声称“休病假”
when they take one of these priests out of circulation.

1194
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:45,198
他们用一堆说法 “未出席”
They use a slew of terms: "Absent on leave,"

1195
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,598
“未分配” “应急响应”
"Unassigned," "Emergency response."

1196
00:59:47,598 --> 00:59:50,368
-这些人什么词都用上了 -除了强奸
- They got a word for everything, these guys. - Except rape.

1197
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:52,908
而且他们比其他神父更频繁地更换教区
And they move parishes way more frequently than other priests.

1198
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:54,288
在我小时候
When I was a kid, a priest moved

1199
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:56,238
一个神父过了七八年才走 有时候更久
after seven or eight years, sometimes longer.

1200
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:58,808
这些人顶多两三年就走了
These guys, it's two to three years tops.

1201
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:01,218
萨维亚诺说的神父后面都是这么写的吗
And did they use these designations for all of saviano's priests?

1202
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,448
恩 这是个很明显的模式
Yeah. It's a pretty clear pattern.

1203
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,448
伙计们 赛普打电话来了
Guys, I got sipe.

1204
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:08,488
我觉得如果你们真的想理解这场危机
I think if you really want to understand the crisis,

1205
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:11,128
你们要先从禁欲需求开始着手
you need to start with the celibacy requirement.

1206
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:13,228
那是我的第一个主要发现
That was my first major finding.

1207
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:16,028
只有一半的神父是禁欲的
Only 50% of the clergy are celibate.

1208
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:20,398
现在大多数神父都和其他成人有过性行为
Now, most of them are having sex with other adults.

1209
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:23,338
但这样子却创造了一种容忍甚至是保护
But the fact remains that this creates a culture of secrecy

1210
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:26,508
其中的恋童癖者的风气
that tolerates and even protects pedophiles.

1211
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,338
那么你觉得教会知道
So you believe the church

1212
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,648
这件事的严重程度吗
is aware of the extent of this, uh, crisis?

1213
01:00:31,648 --> 01:00:32,948
噢 当然
Oh, absolutely.

1214
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:34,918
在路易斯安那州首先爆出丑闻后
After the first major scandal in Louisiana,

1215
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:38,248
教廷大使的秘书兼教律学家和汤姆・多伊尔
tom Doyle, the secretary canonist for the papal nuncio,

1216
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:41,118
共同创作了一份报告 警告恋童癖的神父
co-authored a report warning pedophile priests

1217
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:43,518
若犯了此罪 则要承担赔偿上亿美元的法律责任
were a billion-dollar liability.

1218
01:00:43,528 --> 01:00:45,358
那是1985年
That was in 1985.

1219
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:46,788
1985年
1985?

1220
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,428
是的
That's right.

1221
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:51,428
谁看了那份报告 有天主教会的人吗
Who saw that report? Anyone from the catholic hierarchy?

1222
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:54,598
当然 多伊尔想把这份报告
Sure. Doyle tried to introduce the report

1223
01:00:54,598 --> 01:00:56,968
在天主教全国主教会议上公布出来
at the national conference of catholic bishops.

1224
01:00:56,968 --> 01:01:00,978
事实上 当时劳主教为这份报告提供了资金
In fact, cardinal law initially helped to fund the report.

1225
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,178
但之后他退缩了 然后他们搁置了此事
But then he backed out and they shelved it.

1226
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:06,708
-他在开玩笑吗 -理查德 我是罗比
- Is he kidding me? - Uh, Richard, robby here.

1227
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:11,388
我们觉得波士顿有十三个符合此模式的神父
We think we have 13 priests in Boston that fit this pattern,

1228
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:15,218
这会是一个大新闻
which would be a very-- a very big story.

1229
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:19,158
你觉得有这么多人吗
Does that sound right to you, uh, in terms of scale?

1230
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:22,858
不 罗比 在我看来是太少了
No, not really, robby. Sounds low to me.

1231
01:01:22,868 --> 01:01:27,198
我估计至少有百分之六对儿童有过性侵行为
My estimates suggest six percent act out sexually with minors.

1232
01:01:27,198 --> 01:01:29,968
百分之六什么
Uh, six percent of what?

1233
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:32,138
百分之六的神父
Six percent of all priests.

1234
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,138
波士顿有多少神父
How many priests do we have in Boston?

1235
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:36,078
大概一千五百个 百分之一是十五个
About 1,500. One percent is 15.

1236
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,608
百分之六是 九十
Six percent is... 90.

1237
01:01:40,878 --> 01:01:43,178
什么 九十个神父
Wait. Nine-ninety priests?

1238
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:44,988
这有可能吗
Is that possible?

1239
01:01:44,988 --> 01:01:48,418
从数量上来看 是的
From a metric standpoint, yes.

1240
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:51,488
那和我的发现是一致的
That would certainly be in line with my findings.

1241
01:01:57,198 --> 01:01:59,328
-喂 -额
- Hello? - Uh--

1242
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:03,168
波士顿有九十个这样的神父
ninety fucking priests? In Boston?

1243
01:02:03,168 --> 01:02:05,408
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

1244
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:08,578
如果有九十个这样的混蛋 人们会知道的
If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.

1245
01:02:08,578 --> 01:02:10,108
也许他们知道
Maybe they do.

1246
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:12,448
但大家都缄默不语吗
And no one said a thing?

1247
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:14,418
大家都是友好的德国人
Good Germans.

1248
01:02:14,418 --> 01:02:16,678
我想你这话可不能在外说
I don't think that's a comparison you want to make publicly.

1249
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:19,918
麦克利什知道 他只是什么都没说
Macleish knew. He just didn't say anything.

1250
01:02:19,918 --> 01:02:21,518
那是十三个神父
That's 13 priests.

1251
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,618
十三和九十之间差别很大的
There's a big difference between 13 and 90.

1252
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:25,428
赛普从哪里得知的这些数字
Where's this guy sipe getting his numbers?

1253
01:02:25,428 --> 01:02:27,458
他对此研究了三十年
Well, he's been studying it for 30 years.

1254
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,858
-他是一位专业的精神治疗医师 -好的
- He is a trained psychotherapist. - Okay.

1255
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:30,838
但我们不能全都听信一个
But we need something

1256
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:32,928
以前是神父 还和一个尼姑结婚的嬉皮士
more than a metric from some hippie ex-priest

1257
01:02:32,938 --> 01:02:34,638
我们还需要更多证据
who's shacking up with a nun.

1258
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:38,038
好 那我们就再找些受害者 这样就能找到更多神父
Okay, so we'll track down more victims. We'll get more priests.

1259
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:40,638
然后我们可以用名录找到他们
Then we could check them against the directories.

1260
01:02:40,638 --> 01:02:43,638
-受害者这么多 -我们会找到的
- That's a shitload of victims. - We'll get there.

1261
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:46,108
要多久
How long's it gonna take?

1262
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,048
太久了
Too long.

1263
01:02:48,948 --> 01:02:50,648
等等 会议结束了吗
Wait. Meeting's over?

1264
01:02:50,648 --> 01:02:52,518
目前是的
Yeah, for now.

1265
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:57,218
-你有什么办法 -要是我们反着来呢
- What've you got? - What if we work backwards?

1266
01:02:57,228 --> 01:02:59,258
-什么意思 反着做什么 -查名录
- What do you mean? From what? - From the directories.

1267
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:01,108
我们一直在用名录确认行为不端的神父
We've been using them to confirm bad priests.

1268
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:02,658
如果我们反着来呢
What if we do it the other way around?

1269
01:03:02,668 --> 01:03:05,168
-用名录来追查行为不端的神父 -正是
- Use the directories to identify bad priests. - Yeah, exactly.

1270
01:03:05,168 --> 01:03:06,668
我们去找那些说法
We search by designation. We

1271
01:03:06,668 --> 01:03:09,468
找标记着“休病假”或“未分配”的所有神父
look for any priest on "Sick leave" Or "Unassigned."

1272
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:11,808
-或者搬过很多次的神父 -恩
- Or have been moved around a lot. - Yeah.

1273
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:15,508
-那要费很多精力吧 -大家一起干就好了
- It's gonna take a load of work. - Well, not if we're all on it.

1274
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:16,778
你也来吗
You too?

1275
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:19,648
-通常来说 “大家”肯定包含了我啊 -对 通常来说是这样
- Generally that's what "All" Means. - Yeah, generally.

1276
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:15,638
图书馆要关门了
Library is closing.

1277
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:20,538
图书馆要关门了
Library is closing.

1278
01:04:29,078 --> 01:04:31,288
我擦
Holy shit.

1279
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:20,198

和赛普估计的只差三个 简直难以置信
That's three off sipe's estimate. That's incredible.

1289
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:43,888

Jim Sullivan's office.

我是沃尔特・罗宾森 我找吉姆・苏利文
Yeah, Walter Robinson for Jim Sullivan.

Tell him it's important, please.

1297
01:06:04,508 --> 01:06:06,408
请稍等
One moment, please.

1298
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:12,518
嘿 罗比 还好吗
Hey, robby. Everything okay?

1299
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,758
我要你告诉我一些事情 吉姆
I need you to tell me something, Jim.

1300
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:17,528
-有九十个神父吗 -什么
- Could it be 90 priests? - What?

1301
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:19,858
有九十个神父这么多吗
Could it be as high as 90?

1302
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,358
天呐 罗比
Jesus, robby.

1303
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,928
我必须得知道 吉姆 如果不重要的话我是不会问的
I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important.

1304
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:28,868
你得收手了 罗比
You gotta stop this, robby.

1305
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:38,518
罗比 麦克利什的助手说
Robby, macleish's assistant

1306
01:06:38,518 --> 01:06:41,018
他时间排满了 没法见我们
said he's all booked up. He can't see us.

1307
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:43,278
好吧 去他的
Yeah. Well, the hell he can't.

1308
01:06:48,488 --> 01:06:50,518
好的 这会很有意思的
All right. That'll be fun.

1309
01:06:53,898 --> 01:06:56,058
我待会来找你 好吗
You know what? I'll catch up with you, okay?

1310
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:58,298
-好的 -嘿
- Okay. - Hey.

1311
01:06:58,298 --> 01:07:01,168
真的很抱歉 我现在没时间谈话
I'm really sorry. I am. I don't have any time to talk right now--

1312
01:07:01,168 --> 01:07:03,138
麦克利什先生 我们有理由相信
Mr. Macleish, we have reason to believe

1313
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:04,278
波士顿有八十七位神父
that there are allegations

1314
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:06,038
都受过指控
against as many as 87 priests in Boston.

1315
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,808
我不能和你们谈这些
I can't talk to you about that.

1316
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:10,738
-这个数字对吗 -你在开玩笑吧
- Does that number sound right to you? - You gotta be kidding me.

1317
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:12,648
我说过了 我现在没时间闲扯
I just told you I don't have time for this crap now.

1318
01:07:12,648 --> 01:07:15,648
埃里克 你调解了多少个神父
Eric, how many priests did you settle?

1319
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:17,648
罗比 你知道我不能告诉你
Robby, you know I can't tell you that.

1320
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:21,058
你得把神父和受害者的名字都给我
You're gonna give me the names and the names of their victims.

1321
01:07:21,058 --> 01:07:22,858
额
Um--

1322
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:24,328
你是在威胁我吗
are you threatening me?

1323
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:26,488
我们现在有两条新闻
We've got two stories here.

1324
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:28,658
一条新闻是关于那些可恶的神父
We've got a story about degenerate clergy,

1325
01:07:28,658 --> 01:07:30,758
另一条则是关于一帮律师
and we've got a story about a bunch of lawyers

1326
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:33,268
他们把性侵儿童案当成了家庭手工业
turning child abuse into a cottage industry.

1327
01:07:33,268 --> 01:07:36,368
你想我们报道哪条新闻
Now, which story do you want us to write?

1328
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:37,838
因为我们必须要选一条
'Cause we're writing one of 'em.

1329
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:44,408
我已经给你寄了一份名单
I already sent you a list of names.

1330
01:07:45,378 --> 01:07:47,108
你在说什么 寄给了谁
What are you talking about? To whom?

1331
01:07:47,118 --> 01:07:49,778
几年前 寄给了《环球报》
The globe. Years ago.

1332
01:07:49,788 --> 01:07:52,118
波特的案子发生后 我接到了很多电话
After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls.

1333
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,288
光是波士顿就有二十个牵扯其中的神父
I had 20 priests in Boston alone,

1334
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:56,288
但没有媒体的帮助 我无法调查他们
but I couldn't go after them without the press.

1335
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:59,528
因此我给了你们一份名单
So I sent you guys a list of names,

1336
01:07:59,528 --> 01:08:01,528
你们却置若罔闻
and you buried it.

1337
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:06,828
-我明天就要这些名字 -去你的剪报里找吧 罗比
- I want those names tomorrow. - Check your goddamn clips, robby.

1338
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:12,968
-我们在剪报里什么也没找到 -是啊 真让人吃惊
- We didn't find anything in the clips. - Yeah. Big surprise.

1339
01:08:13,908 --> 01:08:18,048
理查德 额 你还在做弥撒吗
Richard, uh, do you still go to mass?

1340
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:20,808
不 我已经有一阵子没去教堂了
No. No, I haven't been to church for some time now.

1341
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:23,448
但我还是个天主教徒
But I still consider myself a catholic.

1342
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:25,248
这怎么行得通呢
H-how does that work?

1343
01:08:25,248 --> 01:08:29,488
教会是一个由人组成的机构 麦克
Well, the church is an institution, Mike, made of men.

1344
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,388
它是短暂的
It's passing.

1345
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:34,128
但我的信仰是永恒的
My faith is in the eternal.

1346
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:36,328
我试着把两者区分开来
I try to separate the two.

1347
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:38,968
-听起来很难 -的确
- Sounds tricky. - It is.

1348
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:42,168
特别是教会还在对我穷追猛打
Especially since the church continues to go after me.

1349
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,138
代价很大的 麦克
It takes a toll, Mike.

1350
01:08:44,138 --> 01:08:46,238
他们想要镇压所有站出来说话的人
They'll try to silence anyone who speaks out.

1351
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,808
我想他们很快就会找上你和你的团队
I'm sure they'll come after you and your team soon enough.

1352
01:08:48,808 --> 01:08:51,248
真的吗 那你觉得他们会怎么做
Really. And how do you think they'd do that?

1353
01:08:54,818 --> 01:08:56,448
喂
Hello?

1354
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:57,918
理查德
Richard?

1355
01:09:04,028 --> 01:09:05,458
谁啊
Who is it?

1356
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,528
坎特伯雷大主教
It's the archbishop of canterbury.

1357
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:13,328
我在披萨店吃了晚饭 剩了一些
I had dinner at santarpio's. Had some leftovers.

1358
01:09:13,338 --> 01:09:16,038
啊 你太棒了 谢啦
Ah, you're the freakin' best. Thanks.

1359
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:18,368
-要喝酒吗 -要
- You want a beer? - Yeah.

1360
01:09:18,368 --> 01:09:19,968
好的
You got it.

1361
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:23,608
天呐 你还要在这个鬼地方住多久
Jesus. How much longer you gonna be in this shithole?

1362
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:25,648
还在想呢
Yeah. I'm working on it.

1363
01:09:25,648 --> 01:09:27,378
她是个好女孩 麦克
She's a good girl, Mike.

1364
01:09:27,378 --> 01:09:30,448
是的 我们会解决的
Yeah, she is. We'll figure it out.

1365
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,888
我最近没什么时间
I haven't had a lot of time lately.

1366
01:09:32,888 --> 01:09:34,888
其实我刚刚才和赛普通完电话
I just got off the phone with sipe, actually.

1367
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:37,218
你亲眼见过这个人吗
Have you met this guy in person yet?

1368
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:41,128
没有 不过他对此事的了解明显跟我们不在一个层次
No, but his knowledge of this is on a whole other level.

1369
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:42,798
我要饿死了
I'm frickin' starving.

1370
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:46,828
九十个神父的事查得怎么样了
So, where are we with the 90?

1371
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:48,368
快了
We're close.

1372
01:09:48,368 --> 01:09:50,368
-多快 -就是快了
- How close? - We're close.

1373
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:52,138
直接回答问题 好吗
Just answer the question, will you?

1374
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,578
我们查到了八十七个
We got 87 names.

1375
01:09:57,578 --> 01:09:59,748
正在努力确认 我们会查清楚的
We're trying to get confirmation. I think we will.

1376
01:10:01,718 --> 01:10:04,418
你在心烦什么
Something bugging you?

1377
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:07,248
我只是很惊讶
It's just surprising, that's all.

1378
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:10,058
恩 是啊
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1379
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:11,788
大家都是
For everybody.

1380
01:10:15,898 --> 01:10:19,228
等等 本 我忘了问你
Wait, Ben. I forgot to ask you.

1381
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:20,488
菲尔・萨维亚诺说
Phil saviano said he sent

1382
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:22,698
几年前他给《环球报》寄了一些资料
a bunch of info over to the globe years ago.

1383
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:25,708
-你知道寄给谁了吗 -不知道 怎么了
- Do you have any idea to who? - No. Why?

1384
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,178
我好奇罢了 我想知道
I'm just curious. I wanted to

1385
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:29,678
你们有没有漏掉什么线索
see if there's any leads you guys didn't run out.

1386
01:10:29,678 --> 01:10:30,988
萨维亚诺五年前是个
Saviano was a fucking train

1387
01:10:30,988 --> 01:10:33,208
操蛋的麻烦鬼 我们没有漏了什么
wreck five years ago. We didn't miss anything.

1388
01:10:33,218 --> 01:10:35,148
这件事得有聚焦的追查
This story needed spotlight.

1389
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:38,688
对 我同意 我只是在跟踪调查
Yeah, I agree. I'm just following up.

1390
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:43,458
-晚安 -嗯 晚安
- Good night. - Yeah, good night.

1391
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:50,628
难以置信 你什么时候搞到这个的
This is unbelievable. When did you get this?

1392
01:10:50,628 --> 01:10:52,698
麦克利什今天早上发邮件给我的
Macleish e-mailed the list this morning.

1393
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:55,398
他处理了涉及四十五个神父的案件
He settled cases against 45 priests.

1394
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:57,808
我们追查劳的事怎么样了
Where are we on Law?

1395
01:10:57,808 --> 01:10:59,968
有线索显示他知道这件事吗
Anything that shows he had knowledge of this?

1396
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,308
我们还在对付加拉贝迪安 但没有具体消息
We're still working garabedian. But nothing concrete.

1397
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:04,978
我一直在想我们那天晚上的对话
I keep thinking about that conversation we had the other night

1398
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:07,748
关于在我们报道波特案的时候
about how Law called down the power of god

1399
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:09,818
劳是如何借用神的力量的
when we reported on Porter.

1400
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:12,318
那就是劳的本性
That's just Law being Law.

1401
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:14,608
好吧 但我查了剪报
Okay. But I checked the clips, and,

1402
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:17,758
呃 波特甚至都不在波士顿教区
uh, Porter isn't even in the Boston archdiocese.

1403
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:22,228
他来自福尔里弗市 所以 为什么反应这么激烈
He's from fall river. So... why the extreme reaction?

1404
01:11:23,498 --> 01:11:25,668
劳肯定知道
Law had to know.

1405
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:27,668
所以他的反应才这么激烈
That's why he had the reaction.

1406
01:11:27,668 --> 01:11:29,738
因为他知道还有其他人
Because he knew there were others.

1407
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,738
我觉得这就是我要的更重要的故事
I think that's the bigger story.

1408
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:37,738
等等 比五十个神父还重要吗
Wait. Bigger than 50 priests?

1409
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:40,508
如果它是至上而下的操作 是的
If it came from the top down, yes.

1410
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:41,678
但这数字明显
But the numbers clearly

1411
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:44,118
暗示了还有更高级的神职人员牵扯进去
indicate that there were senior clergy involved.

1412
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:45,848
但是现在这些也只能是暗示
That's all they do-- indicate.

1413
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:47,088
你是说如果我们
Are you telling me that if we

1414
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:49,188
发表波士顿有五十个恋童癖神父的报道
run a story with 50 pedophile priests in Boston--

1415
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:50,458
麦克
Mike.

1416
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:53,028
我们就会陷入跟你报道波特案后一样的激烈争论
We'll get into the same catfight you got into on Porter,

1417
01:11:53,028 --> 01:11:57,158
除了制造噪音之外完全没有改变任何事情
which made a lot of noise but changed things not one bit.

1418
01:12:00,038 --> 01:12:03,668
我们得把注意力集中在教会机构 而不是个别神父
We need to focus on the institution, not the individual priests.

1419
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,868
惯例跟政策
Practice and policy.

1420
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,668
你们得让我看到教会操纵了司法体系
Show me the church manipulated the system

1421
01:12:07,678 --> 01:12:09,978
所以这些家伙才得以逃脱指控
so that these guys wouldn't have to face charges.

1422
01:12:09,978 --> 01:12:12,208
要让我看到他们一次又一次地
Show me they put those same priests back into parishes

01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:55,878
她几年后在街上见过他
She saw him in the street a few years later.

1455
01:13:56,878 --> 01:13:58,318
主教走进了房子
The bishop came to the house.

首领主教当然知道 每个人都知道

嗯 那公诉人呢

01:14:40,598 --> 01:14:44,428
-我不该谈这件破事 -其实我觉得你应该
- I shouldn't talk about this shit. - I think you should, actually.

Do you know a father Hurley or a father Gale?

1476
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:50,638
-我会把你打得屁滚尿流 -抱歉打扰你了

We spoke to several men who knew you when they were boys

1486
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:21,498
就认识你的人谈过
at St. John the baptist in haverhill.

1487
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:25,108
他们说你曾性骚扰过他们 这是真的吗
Did-- they told us you molested them. Is that true?

1488
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:29,638

但我自己从未感到开心过
But I never felt gratified myself.

1490
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,408
这样 嗯
Right. Um--

1491
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:38,148
但你承认在圣约翰浸信会性骚扰过男孩子们
but you admit to molesting boys at St. John the baptist?

1492
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:42,258
对对 但就像我说的 我从来没得到过任何快感
Yes, yes, but as I said, I never got any pleasure from it.

1493
01:15:42,258 --> 01:15:44,558
了解这一点是很重要的
That's important to understand.

1494
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:46,088
好的
Right.

1495
01:15:46,098 --> 01:15:48,028
嗯 但你能告诉我
Um, but can you tell me

1496
01:15:48,028 --> 01:15:50,398
你是在哪里 又是怎么玩弄那些男孩子的
where and how you fooled around with these boys?

1497
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:55,898
我要说清楚一点 我从来没有强暴过任何人
I want to be clear. I never raped anyone.

1498

- And I don't want you coming back here. - Miss paquin--

1509

1510
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:34,978
-不可能 -我上次就超过你了

1511
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:38,038
才没有 你作弊了
No, you didn't. You cheated. You did.

1512
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:47,748
能请你为我阐明一下《环球报》的态度吗 阿尔巴诺先生
Could you please clarify the globe's position for me, Mr. Albano?

1513
01:16:47,758 --> 01:16:49,558
好的 斯威尼法官
Yes, judge sweeney.

1514
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:56,098
我们关于公开这些文件的论证
Our argument to make these documents public

1515
01:16:56,098 --> 01:16:58,498
主要是基于第一修正案的
rests mainly on first amendment grounds.

1516
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:01,598
我们还有一些其他相关的论证
We also have a number of other relevant arguments.

1517
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,168
法官阁下 毕竟这是个自由裁量指令
After all, your honor, this was a discretionary order.

1518
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,938
是的 它取决于法官的裁量
Yes. It was made at the judge's discretion.

1519
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:08,508
嘿 麦克
Hey, Mike.

1520
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:10,508
嗨 乔
Hey, Joe.

1521
01:17:10,508 --> 01:17:13,148
聚焦的记者来到斯普林菲尔德做什么
What's a spotlight reporter doing in Springfield?

1522
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:17,818
你的阿尔巴诺正在逆水行舟
Your boy albano's sledding uphill.

1523
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:20,018
你真的觉得你们有机会赢这场官司吗
You actually think you have a shot at winning this thing?

1524
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,088
你想让我对《先驱报》发表评论吗
You want me to comment for the herald?

1525
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,958
“环球报记者不予置评
"Globe reporter would not comment,

1526
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,658
但他看起来不抱希望”
but he did not seem hopeful."

1527
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:32,968
他完全不试图隐瞒
He didn't try and hide it at all.

1528
01:17:32,968 --> 01:17:35,868
他有相当奇怪的合理化说法
He had this really odd rationalization for it,

1529
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:39,538
好像玩弄小男孩是完全正常的事情
like it was totally normal to fool around with little boys.

1530
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:42,478
我真的很想回去 我觉得他会愿意跟我们谈谈
I'd really like to go back. I think he'd talk to us.

1531
01:17:42,478 --> 01:17:44,538
噢 我们会的
Oh, we will.

1532
01:17:44,548 --> 01:17:46,208
只是时机未到
Just not yet.

1533
01:17:46,218 --> 01:17:48,718
我希望你现在继续重点关注受害者们
I want you to stay focused on the victims right now.

1534
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:51,178
萨夏 他们把塔尔伯特神父送到哪了
Sacha, where'd they send father Talbot again?

1535
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:53,448
呃 好像是 舍沃罗斯
Um, I think-- wasn't that cheverus?

1536
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,558
舍沃罗斯 没错 等等
Cheverus. That's right. Wait.

1537
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:57,558
塔尔伯特是波士顿天主教高中的吗
Father Talbot from bc high?

1538
01:17:57,558 --> 01:17:59,828
对 你认识他吗
Yeah. You know him?

1539
01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:02,498
嗯 我们是同一时期读的中学
Yeah. He was there when I was.

1540
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:05,968
-是受害者吗 -对 住在普罗维登斯
- We have a victim? - Yeah. Lives in Providence.

1541
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:12,368
这些文件都无关个人 法官阁下
There's nothing personal in these documents, your honor.

1542
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:14,068
他们是关于红衣主教怎么处理
They concern how the cardinal is handling--

1543
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:16,538
请说“总教区”
say "The archdiocese."

1544
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:18,008
什么
Excuse me?

1545
01:18:18,008 --> 01:18:21,248
你不能把所有事都归为红衣主教的所为 阿尔巴诺先生
You don't get to tag the cardinal with everything, Mr. Albano.

1546
01:18:21,248 --> 01:18:23,718
请说“总教区”
Say "The archdiocese."

1547
01:18:23,718 --> 01:18:25,118
斯威尼法官 《环球报》不是
Judge sweeney, the globe is not a

1548
01:18:25,128 --> 01:18:27,248
本案相关的任何一方 他们只是想增加销量罢了
party to this case. They just want to sell papers.

1549
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:30,758
如果加拉贝迪安先生没有诋毁主教的清名
If Mr. Garabedian had not smeared the cardinal's good name,

1550
01:18:30,758 --> 01:18:32,328
我们也不会在这里了
we wouldn't even be here.

1551
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:35,098
法官阁下 我反对使用“诋毁”这个词
Your honor, I object to the use of the word "Smear."

1552
01:18:35,098 --> 01:18:37,828
-已悉 加拉贝迪安先生 -谢谢 法官阁下
- Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian. - Thank you, your honor.

1553
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:40,168
-还有吗 罗杰斯先生 -没了 法官阁下
- Anything else, Mr. Rogers? - No, your honor.

1554
01:18:40,168 --> 01:18:41,938
阿尔巴诺先生 您请继续
Mr. Albano, you may continue.

1555
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:43,438
《环球报》认为
The globe believes having--

1556
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:48,008
喂 米奇 最近好吗
hey, Mitch, how you doing?

1557
01:18:48,008 --> 01:18:50,078
挺好的
I'm fine.

1558
01:18:50,078 --> 01:18:52,948
他挺难搞的啊 那个威尔逊・罗杰斯
He's tough, that Wilson Rogers.

1559
01:18:52,948 --> 01:18:56,018
他太自以为是 还很马虎
He's smug. And he's sloppy.

1560
01:18:56,018 --> 01:18:58,448
看起来不马虎啊
He doesn't seem sloppy.

1561
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:01,588
你没有我知道的多 相信我
You don't know the half of it. Trust me.

1562
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:03,188
你还知道什么
What's the half of it?

1563
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:07,528
告诉我啊 米奇
Tell me the half of it, Mitch.

1564
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:11,198
-私底下讲吗 -对 偷偷告诉我
- Off the record? - Off the record, yeah.

1565
01:19:14,468 --> 01:19:17,068
三年前 我接到一个前神父的电话
Three years ago, I get a call from an ex-priest.

1566
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:18,468
安东尼・本泽维奇
Anthony benzevich.

1567
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:20,868
他在62年的圣餐礼上
He was at blessed sacrament back in '62,

1568
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:22,608
看到吉欧根
and he saw geoghan...

1569
01:19:24,308 --> 01:19:26,608
把小男孩们带进管区卧室
Taking little boys up to the rectory bedroom, okay?

1570
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:30,478
他觉得很震惊 然后就告诉了主教
So he's appalled, all right? Tells the bishop about it.

1571
01:19:30,488 --> 01:19:34,318
然后主教威胁要把他派到南美
And the bishop threatens to reassign him to south America.

1572
01:19:34,318 --> 01:19:35,988
-老天 -对 没错
- Jesus. - Yeah, all right.

1573
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:38,328
所以快进三十五年 本泽维奇在报上看到
So fast-forward 35 years, benzevich reads

1574
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:41,428
吉欧根被指控对数百个孩子进行过性骚扰
that geoghan has been charged with molesting hundreds of kids.

1575
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:43,498
然后他感到内疚 给我打了电话
All right? So he feels guilty. He calls me.

1576
01:19:43,498 --> 01:19:45,728
所以你手里有一份神父
So you have testimony of a priest

1577
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:48,168
在62年向他上级举报吉欧根的证词吗
telling his superiors about geoghan in '62?

1578
01:19:48,168 --> 01:19:50,438
不 我没有
No, I do not.

1579
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:53,068
因为我让本泽维奇来做宣誓证词的时候
Because when I called benzevich in to give a deposition,

1580
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:55,178
他带了个律师过来
he comes in with a lawyer.

1581
01:19:55,178 --> 01:19:57,308
-威尔逊・罗杰斯 -对
- Wilson Rogers. - Right.

1582
01:19:57,308 --> 01:19:59,978
然后本泽维奇神父就突然变得记忆模糊了
And suddenly father benzevich has a very foggy memory.

1583
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:02,178
什么也不记得了 没用了
Can't remember anything. He's useless.

1584
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:05,248
所以我就回去工作 忘了这件事
So I go back to work. I forget about it. Whatever.

1585
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:07,318
直到一年前 我找到一篇文章
Until about a year ago, I find an article

1586
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:10,458
是讲有一个神父警告教会注意吉欧根的事
about a priest who warned church officials about geoghan.

1587
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,828
-本泽维奇去找了媒体吗 -对
- Benzevich went to the press? - Yeah.

1588
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:15,628
对 当地报纸 叫做《爱国者纪事报》 没人看到
Yeah. Local paper, patriot ledger. Nobody saw it.

1589
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:17,528
但我有本泽维奇的公开声明了
But now I got benzevich on record.

1590
01:20:17,528 --> 01:20:21,628
所以我提出动议让本泽维奇再次宣誓作证
So I file a motion to depose benzevich a second time. All right?

1591
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:24,668
然后威尔逊・罗杰斯 那个自以为是的王八蛋
And Wilson Rogers, that smug son of a bitch,

1592
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:27,868
他提了个动议来反对我的动议
he files a motion opposing my motion.

1593
01:20:27,878 --> 01:20:29,508
就是那时候我抓住了他的把柄
And that's when I have him.

1594
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:32,008
把柄 什么把柄
Have-- have him how?

1595
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:35,618
罗杰斯反对我的动议 所以我得做个论证
Rogers opposes my motion, so I have to make an argument

1596
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:36,698
证明为什么要允许
as to why I'm allowed to

1597
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,688
我再次请本泽维奇神父作证
depose father benzevich a second time, okay?

1598
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:41,888
但是这次 我可以附加上一些证据
But this time, I'm allowed to attach exhibits.

1599
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:43,488
你明白我在说什么吗
Do you follow what I'm saying?

1600
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:45,058
-附加上那些密封文件吗 -对
- The sealed documents? - Yes.

1601
01:20:45,058 --> 01:20:47,288
我可以附上
I can attach the sealed documents

1602
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:49,558
我发现的密封文件 雷赞德斯先生
that I've gotten in discovery, Mr. Rezendes,

1603
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:53,228
就是你们报社现在在找的那些文件
the same documents that your paper is currently suing for.

1604
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:54,668
你在唬我
You're shitting me.

1605
01:20:54,668 --> 01:20:56,968
什么 不不 我没骗你
What? No. No, I'm not shitting you.

1606
01:20:56,968 --> 01:20:59,408
所以我调出十四份最确凿的文件
So I pull out the 14 most damning docs

1607
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:01,238
把它们附加到我的动议里
and I attach them to my motion.

1608
01:21:01,238 --> 01:21:03,238
这样就能证明了一切 一切
And they prove everything. Everything.

1609
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:05,808
关于教会 关于主教 关于劳
About the church, about the bishops, about Law.

1610
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:07,578
而这是全部公开的吗
And it's all public?

1611
01:21:07,578 --> 01:21:09,848
因为你反对罗杰动议的动议
Because your motion to oppose Roger's motion--

1612
01:21:09,848 --> 01:21:10,818
是公开的
is public.

1613
01:21:10,818 --> 01:21:13,748
对 就是这样 现在你终于注意到了
Yeah. Exactly. Now you're paying attention.

1614
01:21:13,758 --> 01:21:14,958
所以我现在能直接走进法院
So I could just walk into that

1615
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,758
拿到那些文件吗
courthouse right now and get those documents?

1616
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:20,528
不 不行 因为那些文件不在法院
No, you cannot, because the documents are not there.

1617
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:22,428
但你刚才说它们是公开的
But you just said they're public.

1618
01:21:22,428 --> 01:21:25,598
我是说过 但这里是波士顿
I know I did. But this is Boston.

1619
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:28,268
而教会并不希望有人找到它们
And the church does not want them to be found.

1620
01:21:28,268 --> 01:21:31,268
所以它们不在那里
So they are not there.

1621
01:21:32,608 --> 01:21:35,538
米奇 你是说天主教会
Mitch, are you telling me that the catholic church

1622
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:37,778
能从法院移走法律文件吗
removed legal documents from that courthouse?

1623
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:41,208
听着 我没疯 也没得妄想症
Look, I'm not crazy. I'm not paranoid.

1624
01:21:41,218 --> 01:21:42,948
我是有处世经验的人
I'm experienced.

1625
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:45,788
查查档案记事表 你就明白了
Check the docket. You'll see.

1626
01:21:45,788 --> 01:21:47,518
他们什么都能操纵
They control everything.

1627
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,758
什么都能
Everything.

1628
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,458
我得回去了
I gotta go back in.

1629
01:21:58,628 --> 01:22:01,268
我得赶紧去拿那些该死的文件
I just got the fucking documents.

1630
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:18,648
诉讼事件表流水号49 吉欧根案
Docket entry number 49, in the geoghan case.

1631
01:22:18,648 --> 01:22:20,818
-好的 谢谢 -我们十分钟后关门
- Okay, thanks. - We close in 10 minutes.

1632
01:22:20,818 --> 01:22:22,358
十分钟 好的
Ten minutes? All right.

1633
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,958
罗比
Robby.

1634
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,528
嘿 你绝对不会相信
Hey. You're not gonna believe it.

1635
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,598
加拉贝迪安给了我一个提示
Garabedian gave me a tip.

1636
01:23:04,598 --> 01:23:06,608
有一些密封文件已经公开了
Some of the sealed docs are already public.

1637
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:08,198
它们是他申请的动议的一部分
They're part of a motion he filed.

1638
01:23:08,198 --> 01:23:09,698
他说它们是文件中的精华
He said they're the best of the bunch.

1639
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,698
我们不必等斯威尼的裁决了
We don't have to wait for sweeney's ruling.

1640
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,268
-所以我们能搞到它们吗 -对 但它们不在那里
- So we can get them? - Yeah, but they're not there.

1641
01:23:14,278 --> 01:23:15,498
已经跟阿尔巴诺谈过了
Already talked to albano.

1642
01:23:15,498 --> 01:23:17,608
他说我们要做的就是提出动议
He said all we have to do is file a motion,

1643
01:23:17,608 --> 01:23:20,178
斯威尼就会让米奇重新归档那些文件
and sweeney will order Mitch to refile the docs.

1644
01:23:20,178 --> 01:23:21,948
你觉得那些文件是
And you think these documents are--

1645
01:23:21,948 --> 01:23:24,878
他说那十四份文件正是我们需要的 非常重要
he said these 14 docs are all we need. They're huge.

1646
01:23:24,888 --> 01:23:26,548
好吧
Okay.

1647
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:29,418
我会打给本 做得很好
I'll call Ben. Good work.

1648
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:47,308
这是纯粹的意外
Is this purely an accident

1649
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:49,038
还是有意的行为
or could this have been an intentional act?

1650
01:23:49,038 --> 01:23:52,748
无论如何 这座建筑都受到了重大的损坏
Either way, extensive damage has been done to this building.

1651
01:23:54,748 --> 01:23:56,348
怎么回事
What happened?

1652
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:59,918
他们说是一架支持机 但那根本不是
They're saying it's a prop plane, but that's not a prop plane.

1653
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:06,828
叫琳达马上把在这儿的所有记者都召集过来
Tell Linda to get every reporter we have in here now.

1654
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:09,928

甚至能反映出上帝的教义
And even more, reflect god's own teaching,

1661
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:36,288
不仅表现在基督教和犹太教

1702
01:26:10,718 --> 01:26:12,618
菲尔 你知道我们为什么得暂停这个报道
Phil, you know why we were taken off of this story.

1703
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:14,048
九・一一都过去六个星期了
It's been six weeks since 9/11.

1704
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:16,388
我知道 我们会重新追踪这件事的
I realize that, and we're gonna get back to it.

1705
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,888
什么时候
When?

1706
01:26:19,228 --> 01:26:21,688
-你们还是会跟上次一样 -不是的
- You're doing the same thing you guys did last time. - No.

1707
01:26:21,698 --> 01:26:23,058
-你们准备放弃了 -不会的
- You're dropping us. - No.

1708
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,898
也许我该把这件事告诉《先驱报》
Maybe I should tell the herald that story.

1709
01:26:25,898 --> 01:26:28,738
好吧 菲尔 你去吧
Okay, Phil, you go ahead and do that.

1710
01:26:28,738 --> 01:26:32,038
这样我们目前的成果全都会付之一炬 但我阻止不了你
It'll undo all the work we've done, but I can't stop you.

1711
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:38,038
听我说 我会来这里是因为我在乎
Listen to me. I am here because I care.

1712
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,648
我们不会放弃的
We're not going away.

1713
01:26:41,648 --> 01:26:44,018
我们会不偏不倚地 把这件事公诸于众
We're gonna tell this story. We're gonna tell it right.

1714
01:26:44,018 --> 01:26:46,748
我们只是还需要一点时间 这是我们全部的请求
We just need a little more time. That's all we're asking for.

1715
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:51,758
何必请求呢
Why bother asking?

1716
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:55,598
不管怎样你们都会想干什么就干什么
You're gonna do what you want anyway.

1717
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:57,428
你们总是这样
You always do.

1718
01:26:57,428 --> 01:26:58,998
菲尔
Phil.

1719
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,428
菲尔
Phil!

1720
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:09,778
喂
Hey.

1721
01:27:09,778 --> 01:27:12,548
-南海滩怎么样 -是博因顿海滩 非常不同的地方
- How's South Beach? - Boynton beach. Remarkably different place.

1722
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:14,108
怎么了
What's up?

1723
01:27:14,118 --> 01:27:16,278
米奇・加拉贝迪安今天联系我了
Mitch garabedian called me today.

1724
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,888
-他为什么打给你 -因为知道你会吼他
- Why'd he call you? - 'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.

1725
01:27:18,888 --> 01:27:21,788
-他重新归档了那些文件 -什么
- He refiled the docs. - What?

1726
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:23,618
罗比 那些文件现在是公开的了
Robby, those docs are public now.

1727
01:27:23,628 --> 01:27:25,558
我们得在别人之前赶过去
We gotta get there before anyone else does.

1728
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:26,588
我知道 我知道 我知道
I know. I know. I know.

1729
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,698
赶紧把手头上的事结束掉 去赶最早的航班
Just wrap up whatever you're doing and get the first flight out.

1730
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:30,438
我现在就订票
I'll book a flight now

1731
01:27:30,438 --> 01:27:31,898
明天直接去法院
and go straight to the courthouse tomorrow.

1732
01:27:31,898 --> 01:27:33,968
-好的 进去之后通知我 -好的
- All right. Call me when you get in. - Okay.

1733
01:27:35,898 --> 01:27:39,038
罗比 我想让菲尔・萨维亚诺知道我们又重新着手这件事了
Robby, I'd like to let Phil saviano know that we're back on it.

1734
01:27:39,038 --> 01:27:40,808
好主意
Good idea.

1735
01:27:40,808 --> 01:27:44,078
跟汉西吃晚饭去吧 这可能会是很长时间以来的最后一次了
Go have dinner with Hansi. Might be the last time for a while.

1736
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:45,678
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

1737
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:52,118
罗比 我们见过麦克利什之后
Robby, after we saw macleish,

1738
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:54,148
我就开始重新看那些剪报
I started going back through the clips.

1739
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:56,318
上周终于有了点时间
And I had a little time last week finally.

1740
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:59,188
所以 嗯 我找到了这个
So, um, I found that.

1741
01:28:00,328 --> 01:28:02,058
这是93年的
It's from '93.

1742
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:14,008
就这个吗
That it?

1743
01:28:15,508 --> 01:28:17,978
对对 就 就这个
Yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's it.

1744
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:21,148
晚安
Good night.

1745
01:28:22,318 --> 01:28:24,078
好的 晚安
Okay. Good night.

1746
01:29:02,358 --> 01:29:03,718
你好
Hello.

1747
01:29:03,728 --> 01:29:05,858
所以 我大概比您小几岁 是吗
So, I was probably a few years after you, right?

1748
01:29:05,858 --> 01:29:08,558
不 你比我小多了
No, you were more than a few.

1749
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:10,158
相信我
Believe me.

1750
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:12,828
嗯 离开波士顿天主教高中之后 我去了普罗维登斯
Well, after bc high, I came down to Providence

1751
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:14,728
为修道士们打曲棍球
and played hockey for the friars.

1752
01:29:14,738 --> 01:29:17,738
哦 你一定表现得很不错
Oh, well, you must have been pretty good.

1753
01:29:17,738 --> 01:29:20,338
不不 这水平在大学里就只能坐冷板凳
No. Rode the bench in college. Yeah.

1754
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:21,868
但我爱这座城市
But I loved the city.

1755
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:24,038
啊哈 而且我们刚刚有了第三个孩子
Uh-huh. And we just had our third kid.

1756
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:26,478
而且提醒你一下 我还在看《环球报》
And I still get my globe, for the record.

1757
01:29:26,478 --> 01:29:29,748
啊 那很好 挺好的
Ah, that's good to know. Good to know.

1758
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:34,718
听着 凯文 呃 其实我来这里的原因
Look, Kevin, uh, that's actually why I'm here.

1759
01:29:34,718 --> 01:29:37,018
-嗯 -我
- Yeah? - I...

1760
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:39,788
我想问你几个关于塔尔伯特神父的问题
I need to ask you some questions about father Talbot.

1761
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:48,768
你怎么发现的
How'd you find out?

1762
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:51,898
这个 呃
Well-- um--

1763
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:54,008
我想这个应该不重要了
I guess it doesn't matter.

1764
01:29:57,538 --> 01:30:02,008
呵 我连我老婆都没说过
Hell, I never even told my wife.

1765
01:30:04,178 --> 01:30:05,748
借过
Excuse me.

1766
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,388
嘿 嘿 嘿 我得进去
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I need to get in there.

1767
01:30:12,388 --> 01:30:14,058
-我们关门了 -拜托 让我进去 五分钟就好
- We're closed. - Come on. Let me in. Five minutes.

1768
01:30:14,058 --> 01:30:17,698
-抱歉 我们关门了 -拜托 五分钟就好
- I'm sorry. We're closed. - Come on. Five minutes.

1769
01:30:32,148 --> 01:30:34,178
给 好了
Here. There.

1770
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:39,118
-这是关于吉欧根案的吗 -没错
- This is the geoghan case? - That's right.

1771
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:42,048
-那些文件是密封的 -不 现在有个公开的动议
- Those records are sealed. - No. That's a public motion.

1772
01:30:42,058 --> 01:30:43,888
那些文件现在是公开的
Those records are public.

1773
01:30:43,888 --> 01:30:47,128
-我是《环球报》的 -挺行的啊
- Look, I work for the globe. - Good for you.

1774
01:30:48,828 --> 01:30:52,398
-我可以跟你的主管谈谈吗 -他今天不在
- Can I talk to your supervisor? - He's not in today.

1775
01:30:52,398 --> 01:30:53,738
那法官呢
What about a judge? There

1776
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:56,268
一定有法官在处理这类事情的
must be judges that work on this kind of thing.

1777
01:30:56,268 --> 01:30:58,068
在六楼
Sixth floor.

1778
01:31:04,278 --> 01:31:05,658
我们明白对塔尔伯特神父的
We understand the nature

1779
01:31:05,658 --> 01:31:08,008
指控到底是怎么一回事
of the allegations against father Talbot.

1780
01:31:08,018 --> 01:31:12,148
我只是不知道你们想从科莫扎校长身上问出些什么
I'm just not sure what you want from president kemeza.

1781
01:31:12,148 --> 01:31:14,348
比尔接手的时候塔尔伯特已经离开很久了
Talbot taught here long before bill took over.

1782
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:15,918
嗯 当然
Mmm. Of course.

1783
01:31:15,918 --> 01:31:18,018
我们只是想知道是不是
We just want to know if it's possible

1784
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:20,088
包括校长 教职人员 董事会在内
that the president, the faculty, the board,

1785
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:21,988
都没人知道那时候发生了什么
that no one knew what was going on at the time.

1786
01:31:21,998 --> 01:31:24,158
我1979年毕业的
I graduated in 1979,

1787
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:26,268
但我完全不知道有这些事
and I had no idea about any of this.

1788
01:31:26,268 --> 01:31:28,298
所以如果你是在暗示吉本斯神父和
So if you're suggesting that father Gibbons

1789
01:31:28,298 --> 01:31:30,538
卡拉汉神父有任何方面的
and father Callahan had in any way--

1790
01:31:30,538 --> 01:31:32,138
吉本斯和卡拉汉
Gibbons and Callahan.

1791
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:34,708
我是说 他们像管海军一样管理这个地方
I mean, they ran this place like the Navy.

1792
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:36,338
你真的觉得他们不知道吗
You really think they didn't know?

1793
01:31:36,338 --> 01:31:40,278
这间学校大得很 罗比 你知道的
It's a big school, robby. You know that.

1794
01:31:40,278 --> 01:31:41,878
现在我们说的是七个所谓的
And then we're talking about

1795
01:31:41,878 --> 01:31:44,518
受害者 还是差不多八年前的事吗
seven alleged victims over, what, eight years?

1796
01:31:44,518 --> 01:31:48,018
不 我们现在知道的有七个
No, we're talking about, you know, seven that we know about.

1797
01:31:48,018 --> 01:31:50,218
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

1798
01:31:50,218 --> 01:31:52,558
-你们是在这里挖新闻 -杰克 杰克
- You're reaching for a story here-- - Jack. Jack.

1799
01:31:52,558 --> 01:31:56,898
杰克 如果我是那时候的校长 我会知道的
Jack. If I had been president then, I would've known.

1800
01:31:56,898 --> 01:31:59,498
比尔 我不确定这有没有关系
Bill, I'm not sure that's relevant.

1801
01:31:59,498 --> 01:32:02,838
不然你觉得他们为什么把塔尔伯特送到舍沃罗斯
Why do you think they sent Talbot up to cheverus?

1802
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:05,298
你知道他们想让他离开这里
You know they wanted him out of town.

1803
01:32:06,408 --> 01:32:08,038
罗比
Robby,

1804
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:10,338
就像比尔所说的 出于好意
as well intentioned as bill's remarks are,

1805
01:32:10,338 --> 01:32:11,688
我希望在达成共识之前
I'm hoping we can keep this

1806
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:13,948
这件事能先保密
between us until we all get on the same page.

1807
01:32:17,248 --> 01:32:20,248
这就是我们来这里的原因吗 达成共识
Is that why we're here, to get on the same page?

1808
01:32:20,248 --> 01:32:21,548
不 我们来这里是因为你是
No, we're here because you're

1809
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:23,418
一名重要的校友 罗比 也是朋友
an important alumnus, robby, and a friend.

1810
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:27,558
正是 而且我们知道你跟我们一样关心这所学校
Exactly. And we know you care about this school as much as we do.

1811
01:32:28,928 --> 01:32:30,758
你在这里参加过体育运动吗 杰克
Did you play a sport here, Jack?

1812
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:33,398
嗯 足球 怎么了
Yeah. Football. Why?

1813
01:32:33,398 --> 01:32:35,168
嗯 我参加的是田径
Mmm. I ran track.

1814
01:32:35,168 --> 01:32:37,268
我昨天去普罗维登斯
You know, I went to Providence yesterday

1815
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:39,568
跟塔尔伯特神父的受害者谈过
to talk to one of father Talbot's victims.

1816
01:32:39,568 --> 01:32:43,578
他在这里打曲棍球 而且打得不错
He played hockey here. And he's one of the better ones.

1817
01:32:43,578 --> 01:32:47,178
他娶了老婆 有孩子 事业有成
He's got a wife, kids, good job.

1818
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:51,848
在大概十分钟的深入谈话之后
About 10 minutes into the conversation,

1819
01:32:51,848 --> 01:32:53,348
他失控了
the guy breaks down.

1820
01:32:53,348 --> 01:32:55,588
哭个不停
You know, couldn't stop crying.

1821
01:32:57,388 --> 01:33:01,028
说他一直想不通塔尔伯特神父为什么会选中他
Said he could never figure out why father Talbot picked him.

1822
01:33:02,898 --> 01:33:05,628
塔尔伯特神父是曲棍球队的教练
Father Talbot coached the hockey team.

1823
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:09,138
所以
So...

1824
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:12,638
我想我们比较幸运
I guess we just got lucky.

1825
01:33:12,638 --> 01:33:14,338
你跟我都是
You and me.

1826
01:33:20,778 --> 01:33:22,618
杰克・邓恩在这学校工作吗
Does Jack Dunn work for the school?

1827
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:24,248
没有 他是波士顿大学的公关
No, he's PR for Boston college.

1828
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:26,248
他们需要帮助的时候就会找他
They call him when they need help.

1829
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:28,318
那皮特・康利呢 他为什么在这儿
And Pete conley, why was he there?

1830
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:30,458
问得好 皮特是位重要校友
Good question. Pete's a big alum.

1831
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:33,158
但我直接联系比尔 请求坐下来详谈的
But I called bill directly and I asked for a sit-down.

1832
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:35,288
我没提到过其他任何人
I never mentioned anybody else.

1833
01:33:36,398 --> 01:33:38,898
好像每个人都已经知道这件事了
It's like everybody already knows the story.

1834

我想查阅资料室的
I'm having some trouble accessing

1838
01:33:51,538 --> 01:33:53,678
一些公开材料 但遇到了点困难
some public records down in the records room.

1839
01:33:53,678 --> 01:33:56,448
我能否与你谈谈
I was wondering if I could have a word with you?

1848
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:22,708
把这些记录公诸于众呢
in publishing records of this nature?

1849
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,298
那新闻记者又有什么责任
Well, where's the editorial

1850
01:34:24,298 --> 01:34:26,548
不把这些记录公诸于众呢
responsibility in not publishing them?

1851
01:34:37,018 --> 01:34:39,488
你不能把这带走 你得去复印一份
You can't take those. You need to make copies.

Take me to the Boston Globe on morrissey boulevard.

1858
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:13,458
别走九十三大道 走多切斯特大道
Don't take 93. Take Dorchester Avenue.

1859
01:35:14,928 --> 01:35:17,028
罗比 这太不可思议了
Robby, it's incredible.

1860
01:35:17,028 --> 01:35:19,728
劳早就知道吉欧根的事了 这点毫无疑问
Law knew about Geoghan for years, no question.

1861
01:35:19,728 --> 01:35:22,938
有一名叫做玛格丽特・加兰特的女士给劳寄过一封信
There's a letter to law from a woman, Margaret Gallant,

1862
01:35:22,938 --> 01:35:24,098
她在上世纪八十年代初
who lived in Jamaica Plain

1863
01:35:24,098 --> 01:35:25,938
居住在牙买加平原 那时吉欧根是那里的神父
in the early '80s when geoghan was there.

1864
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:27,438
听听这个
Listen to this.

1865
01:35:27,438 --> 01:35:29,608
“教会是我们家庭的根
"Our family is rooted in the church.

1866
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:32,338
哪怕身处痛苦之中 我们也竭力
Our desire is to protect the holy orders

1867
01:35:32,348 --> 01:35:34,708
维护着圣职
even in the midst of our agony

1868
01:35:34,718 --> 01:35:38,048
隐瞒了家族中七个男孩被侵犯的事实”
over the seven boys in our family who have been violated."

1869
01:35:38,048 --> 01:35:40,518
七个啊 罗比 七个男孩
Seven, robby. Seven boys.

1870
01:35:40,518 --> 01:35:43,618
“我们被迫保持沉默
"It was suggested we keep silent.

1871
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:47,128
我们从未质疑过教会的权威
We did not question the authority of the church two years ago.

1872
01:35:47,128 --> 01:35:50,128
直到两年前 我得知神父吉欧根还在他的教区任职”
But since Father Geoghan is still in his parish--"

1873
01:35:50,128 --> 01:35:53,868
她把这封信寄给了劳 却完全被无视了
but she sent it to law and law did shit.

1874
01:35:53,868 --> 01:35:57,438
这儿还有一封寄给劳的信 同一年的 听着
Here's another one to law, same year. Listen to this.

1875
01:35:57,438 --> 01:36:00,108
“针对最近教会将神父吉欧根委派至
"A word on the recent assignment of father Geoghan...

1876
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:03,208
韦斯顿的圣朱丽亚教区一事 我有话要说
As an associate at St. Julia's in Weston.

1877
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:04,778
神父吉欧根曾有过
Father Geoghan has a history

1878
01:36:04,788 --> 01:36:07,148
性侵男童的记录
of homosexual involvement with young boys.

1879
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:09,778
我想他最近被调离圣布兰登教区
I understand his recent departure from St. Brendan's

1880
01:36:09,778 --> 01:36:11,778
也与此有关
may be related to this problem.

1881
01:36:11,788 --> 01:36:13,048
我能否请求教区
I wonder if Father Geoghan

1882
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:15,088
撤销对其的降职处理
should not be reduced to just weekend work

1883
01:36:15,088 --> 01:36:16,988
而让他接受治疗
while receiving some kind of therapy.

1884
01:36:16,988 --> 01:36:19,988
对于您长期以来的关怀我感激不尽
You know how grateful I am to you for your constant concern.

1885
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:21,728
愿主保佑您
Sincerely yours in our lord,

1886
01:36:21,728 --> 01:36:25,498
尊敬的主教大人约翰・M・达西 波士顿副主教上
most reverend John M D'arcy, auxiliary bishop of Boston.

1887
01:36:25,498 --> 01:36:27,128
一九八四年十二月七日”
December 7, 1984."

1888
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:28,798
这是一个副主教写的信吗
An auxiliary bishop wrote that?

1889
01:36:28,798 --> 01:36:30,468
这太令人震惊了
That's incredible.

1890
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:33,438
他越级了 我是说 加兰特是什么时候写的信
He broke ranks. I mean, when did Gallant write her letter?

1891
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:35,608
1984年 劳直接无视了
1984. And law just ignored it.

1892
01:36:35,608 --> 01:36:37,908
这样的信怎么能无视呢
How do you ignore that freakin' letter?

1893
01:36:37,908 --> 01:36:39,508
但我们拿到了
We got 'em.

1894
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:42,448
看了这些信 我们不能想别的了 这是证据啊
You can't read these letters and think anything else. It's proof.

1895
01:36:42,448 --> 01:36:44,818
是啊 没错
Yeah, it is.

1896
01:36:44,818 --> 01:36:47,118
这很好
This is good work.

1897
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:49,248
我们要不要把它交给本
Should we take it up to Ben?

1898
01:36:49,258 --> 01:36:52,258
呃 不 暂时不要
Uh, no. Not yet.

1899
01:36:52,258 --> 01:36:55,858
为什么不呢 我们抓到劳的把柄了 这就是啊
Why not? We got law. This is it.

1900
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:58,028
不 这只是劳包庇一个神父的证据
No, this is law covering for one priest.

1901
01:36:58,028 --> 01:36:59,598
还有其他九十位神父逍遥法外呢
There's another 90 out there.

1902
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:01,598
我知道 等我们拿到证据了再曝光他们也不迟
Yeah, we'll print that story when we get it,

1903
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:02,968
但我们现在得把这个报道出来
but we gotta go with this now.

1904
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:04,518
这个报道我不想仓促而行 麦克
I'm not gonna rush this story,Mike.

1905
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:06,368
我们别无选择 罗比
We don't have a choice, Robby.

1906
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:08,538
如果我们不赶紧报道
If we don't rush to print,

1907
01:37:08,538 --> 01:37:09,348
就会有人
somebody else is going

1908
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:10,978
发现这些信件 抢先披露出来
to find these letters and butcher the story.

1909
01:37:10,978 --> 01:37:13,948
《先驱报》的乔・昆比当时就在法院蹲点呢
Joe Quimby from The Herald was at the freaking courthouse.

1910
01:37:13,948 --> 01:37:15,208
那我们就先写一份报道放着
So we'll write a holding

1911
01:37:15,218 --> 01:37:17,478
同时紧盯《先驱报》的动向
story and we'll keep our eye on The Herald.

1912
01:37:17,488 --> 01:37:19,388
紧盯《先驱报》的动向
Keep our eye on The Herald?

1913
01:37:19,388 --> 01:37:21,388
如果他们插手进来 报道出了差错的话 教会会把这事给压下去的
They run this and get it wrong, the church will bury it.

1914
01:37:21,388 --> 01:37:23,188
-我们现在就得报道出来 -麦克 麦克
- We gotta do this now. - Mike, Mike.

1915
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:25,518
怎么了 为什么要犹豫不决呢
What? Why are we hesitating?

1916
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:27,888
巴伦让我们抓劳的把柄 我们抓到了
Baron told us to get law. This is law.

1917
01:37:27,898 --> 01:37:29,898
巴伦是让我们揭露整个系统
Baron told us to get the system.

1918
01:37:29,898 --> 01:37:31,038
我们需要着眼全局
We need the full scope.

1919
01:37:31,038 --> 01:37:33,568
这是我们了结此事的唯一途径
That's the only thing that will put an end to this.

1920
01:37:33,568 --> 01:37:35,528
那我们把这拿去给本 让他来做决定
Then let's take it to Ben, let him decide.

1921
01:37:35,538 --> 01:37:37,398
到时候我自然会拿给他看 这由我来决定
We'll take it to Ben when I say it's time.

1922
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:41,408
到时候了 罗比 是时候了
It's time, Robby! It's time!

1923
01:37:41,408 --> 01:37:45,408
他们早就知道了 却放任悲剧降临到孩子们身上
They knew and they let it happen. To kids!

1924
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:48,408
受害者本可能是你 也可能是我
Okay? It could've been you. It could've been me.

1925
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:50,918
可能是我们任何人
It could've been any of us.

1926
01:37:50,918 --> 01:37:52,748
我们得揭穿这些卑鄙小人
We gotta nail these scumbags.

1927
01:37:52,748 --> 01:37:55,888
我们得让世人知道没人能逃脱罪责
We gotta show people that nobody can get away with this.

1928
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:59,588
神父不可以 红衣主教不可以 教皇也不可以
Not a priest or a cardinal or a freaking pope!

1929
01:38:02,098 --> 01:38:04,098
你说完了吗
You finished?

1930
01:38:04,098 --> 01:38:07,398
对 我说完了 你简直就是在放屁
Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.

1931
01:38:36,028 --> 01:38:37,858
你没事吧
You okay?

1932
01:38:40,368 --> 01:38:42,798
嗯
Mmm.

1933
01:38:47,968 --> 01:38:49,438

01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:01,588
我 我 我不知道我为什么会那么生气
I-I-I-I don't know why I got so pissed off.

1937
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:03,258
我觉得罗比错了
You know, I think Robby's wrong.

1938
01:39:03,258 --> 01:39:04,658
其实 你只是
You know, you're just--

1939
01:39:04,658 --> 01:39:07,228
你太关心这次报道了 麦克 大家都一样
you care about the story, Mike. We all do.

1940
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:11,658
-是啊 也许吧 -嗯
- Yeah, I guess. - Hmm.

1941
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:16,568
我已经不再陪我奶奶去教堂了
I stopped going to church with my Nana.

1942
01:39:17,998 --> 01:39:20,008
这 这太难熬了 我
It was-- it was too hard. I--

1943
01:39:20,008 --> 01:39:22,168
你知道吗 我坐在那里
you know, I'd be sitting there,

1944
01:39:22,178 --> 01:39:25,478
然后就会想起乔・克劳利或者其他人
and I would start thinking about Joe Crowley or someone else,

1945
01:39:25,478 --> 01:39:29,178
然后我 我就会很愤怒
and I just-- I just got so angry.

1946
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:31,748
你有 你有告诉她原因吗
Did you-- did you tell her why?

1947
01:39:33,188 --> 01:39:35,388
她一周要去三次教堂 麦克
She goes to church three times a week, Mike.

1948
01:39:40,258 --> 01:39:42,528
这真的使我很恼火
It really pisses me off.

1949
01:39:43,858 --> 01:39:46,698
你知道吗
You know,

1950
01:39:46,698 --> 01:39:50,198
当我还是个小孩子的时候 我真的很喜欢去教堂
I actually really liked going to church when I was a little kid.

1951
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:52,038
嗯
Mmm.

1952
01:39:52,038 --> 01:39:55,008
-后来为什么不去了呢 -没什么特别的原因
- Why'd you stop? - Typical shit.

1953
01:39:56,478 --> 01:39:58,608
但奇怪的是
But the weird thing is...

1954
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,378
我感觉
I think I--

1955
01:40:04,388 --> 01:40:07,448
我总觉得没准有一天我会 我会
I think I figured that maybe one day I w-- I w--

1956
01:40:07,448 --> 01:40:11,618
我会再回去的
I would actually go back.

1957
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:14,788
我真的 我真的有这个打算的
I was really-- I was holding on to that.

1958
01:40:14,798 --> 01:40:16,358
嗯
Mm-hmm.

1959
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:21,128
当我看完那些信 然后
I read those letters, and it--

1960
01:40:21,138 --> 01:40:25,398
就好像是 心里有什么东西裂开了
and something just... cracked.

1961
01:40:26,308 --> 01:40:28,568
-这感觉很糟糕 -是啊
- It's a shitty feeling. - Yeah.

1962
01:40:29,908 --> 01:40:31,908
这种感觉很糟糕
It's a shitty feeling.

1963
01:40:35,518 --> 01:40:37,878
-看来你今天过得并不顺啊 -嘿 皮特

很抱歉我还得打搅你
I'm sorry to make it longer.

1965
01:40:40,148 --> 01:40:41,388
布莱恩
Brian.

1966
01:40:42,558 --> 01:40:44,918
没有人能拒绝和你喝一杯吧 皮特
Has anyone ever said no to a drink with you, Pete?

1967
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,388
嗯 当然有啊
Well, sure.

1968
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:49,928
关键是得坚持邀请
But the trick is to keep asking.

1969
01:40:49,928 --> 01:40:51,998
-为了波士顿  -波士顿
- For Boston. - Boston.

1970
01:40:53,028 --> 01:40:54,828
嗯
Mmm.

1971
01:40:54,838 --> 01:40:58,168
那么 嗯 你是为了红衣主教的事来的吗
So, um, you here for the cardinal?

1972
01:40:58,168 --> 01:40:59,768
噢 不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1973
01:40:59,768 --> 01:41:03,578
我可不敢擅自代表红衣主教 绝对不敢
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't presume to speak for the cardinal, no.

1974
01:41:04,938 --> 01:41:08,748
你知道的 这里有很多人非常尊敬你 罗比
You know, you got a lot of people here who respect you, Robby.

1975
01:41:08,748 --> 01:41:11,348
-嗯 -因为你做的事
- Yeah.  - With work you do.

1976
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:14,848
-这让我挺开心的 -因为你热爱这个城市
- That's good to know. - It's 'cause you care about this place.

1977
01:41:14,858 --> 01:41:18,018
这也是你身为新闻人的原因 这是你的使命
It's why you do what you do. It's who you are.

1978
01:41:18,028 --> 01:41:23,398
但你要知道 人们现在需要教会的存在 比任何时候都需要
You know, but people need the church, more than ever right now.

1979
01:41:23,398 --> 01:41:25,598
你可以体会得到
You know, you can feel it.

1980
01:41:25,598 --> 01:41:27,698
并且红衣主教 呃
And the cardinal, uh--

1981
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:32,238
你知道的 红衣主教他 也许不是完人
you know, the cardinal, he might not be perfect.

1982
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:33,538
但我们不能因为几粒老鼠屎
But we can't throw out all

1983
01:41:33,538 --> 01:41:35,638
就否定他的杰出贡献
the good he's doing over a few bad apples.

1984
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,818
我现在跟你提这些
Now, you know, I'm bringing

1985
01:41:38,818 --> 01:41:41,478
是因为我知道这都是巴伦的主意
this up to you because I know this is Baron's idea.

1986
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:43,248
这是他要做的事
His agenda.

1987
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:45,148
我得告诉你 我是说 说句实话
I gotta tell ya, I mean, honest to god,

1988
01:41:45,148 --> 01:41:48,488
他不像我们这样热爱这座城市
I mean, he doesn't care about the city the way we do.

1989
01:41:48,488 --> 01:41:50,688
他怎么可能呢
I mean, how could he?

1990
01:41:56,658 --> 01:41:58,798
这就是你们的惯用伎俩 对吗 皮特
This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?

1991
01:41:58,798 --> 01:42:00,168
怎么说
What's that?

1992
01:42:00,168 --> 01:42:01,968
一个人去威逼利诱另一个人
A guy leans on a guy,

1993
01:42:01,968 --> 01:42:05,638
然后忽然间对整座城市的看法都变了
and suddenly the whole town just looks the other way.

1994
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:10,578
罗比 罗比 听着
Robby. Robby. Look it.

1995
01:42:11,678 --> 01:42:14,778
马蒂・巴伦只是想赚点名气罢了
Marty Baron is just trying to make his mark.

1996
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:17,448
他只会在这里呆上几年 然后就会升迁离开了
He's gonna be here for a couple of years and he's gonna move on.

1997
01:42:17,448 --> 01:42:20,418
就像他在纽约和迈阿密时一样
Just like he did in New York and Miami.

1998
01:42:21,688 --> 01:42:23,758
但是你又能去哪里呢
Where are you gonna go?

1999
01:42:25,358 --> 01:42:26,988
嗯
Hmm?

2000
01:42:28,488 --> 01:42:31,098
晚安 罗比 布莱恩
Good night, Robby. Brian.

2001
01:42:32,198 --> 01:42:34,798
-嘿 呃 皮特  -什么事
- Hey, uh, Pete. - Yeah?

2002
01:42:34,798 --> 01:42:38,598
呃 当我们真的报道此事时
Uh, when we do run the story,

2003
01:42:38,608 --> 01:42:41,168
额 我需要红衣主教的评论
uh, I'm gonna need a comment from the cardinal.

2004
01:42:43,378 --> 01:42:46,038
我们回头再谈 晚安 罗比
We'll talk again later. Good night, Robby.

2005
01:42:46,048 --> 01:42:48,008
晚安 皮特
Night, Pete.

2006
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:59,218
我是罗比
Robby.

2007
01:43:00,688 --> 01:43:02,388
什么
What?

2008
01:43:02,398 --> 01:43:04,758
真的假的 什么时候
No shit. When?

2009
01:43:06,568 --> 01:43:08,968
好的 好
Okay. Yeah.

2010
01:43:11,838 --> 01:43:14,068
嘿
Hey.

2011
01:43:14,068 --> 01:43:15,638
怎么了
What's up?

2012
01:43:16,678 --> 01:43:18,808
斯威尼做出了支持我们的裁决
Sweeney ruled in our favor.

2013
01:43:18,808 --> 01:43:21,048
她判决将文件开封
She ruled to unseal the documents.

2014
01:43:22,548 --> 01:43:24,948
天哪 哈
Geez. Huh.

2015
01:43:27,018 --> 01:43:29,248
教会已经提起了上诉
The church has already filed an appeal.

2016
01:43:29,258 --> 01:43:32,418
但初审法院对此的判决仍旧有效
But the trial court ruling is generally upheld in these matters.

2017
01:43:32,428 --> 01:43:34,888
那我们什么时候能拿到那些文件
And when would we get the documents?

2018
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:37,828
科恩也许还得花几周时间来处理
Probably takes Cohen a few weeks to rule.

2019
01:43:37,828 --> 01:43:39,928
然后还需要走一个校订的流程
Then there's a redaction process.

2020
01:43:39,928 --> 01:43:43,998
呃 我认为在一月中旬文件就能公布了
Uh, I'd say they'd be made public mid-January.

2021
01:43:43,998 --> 01:43:45,438
-好的 -行了
- Okay. - All right.

2022
01:43:45,438 --> 01:43:46,608
-谢谢 约翰  -没事
- Thanks, John. - You bet.

2023
01:43:46,608 --> 01:43:47,868
-你做得很棒  -谢谢
- Nice work. - Thanks.

2024
01:43:47,878 --> 01:43:50,438
《都市报》得写点东西出来 马蒂
Metro should run something, Marty.

2025
01:43:50,438 --> 01:43:52,108
这事我们不能大肆宣传
We can't run this one big.

2026
01:43:52,108 --> 01:43:55,748
为什么不能 这是一次意义重大的挑战修正案的胜利啊
Why wouldn't we? It's a major first amendment victory.

2027
01:43:55,748 --> 01:43:57,068
更别提你成功让
Not to mention, you get an

2028
01:43:57,068 --> 01:43:59,448
一个爱尔兰裔天主教法官来对抗教会
Irish catholic judge ruling against the church?

2029
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:01,948
-这可是个了不得的先例啊 -嗯
- That's a hell of a precedent. - Mm-hmm.

2030
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:04,288
我们不能让《先驱报》深挖此事
We don't want The Herald going deep on this.

2031
01:44:04,288 --> 01:44:06,158
为什么
Why's that?

2032
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:10,298
你得先回避一下 彼得
You're gonna have to step out, Peter.

2033
01:44:10,298 --> 01:44:11,998
我才不回避呢
I'm not stepping out.

2034
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:21,268
彼得
Peter.

2035
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,118
-你是什么时候 呃  -几周前
- When did you, uh-- - a couple of weeks ago.

2036
01:44:38,128 --> 01:44:39,828
几周前
A couple of weeks?

2037
01:44:39,828 --> 01:44:41,488
-是的  -然后你现在才告诉我们吗
- Yeah. - And you're telling us now?

2038
01:44:41,498 --> 01:44:44,158
这些材料太重要了
These are substantial.

2039
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:46,598
这些材料清楚地表明劳有渎职行为
They clearly show that law was negligent.

2040
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:48,428
我需要更多时间
I need more time.

2041
01:44:48,438 --> 01:44:50,498
-我想接着调查下去  -调查什么
- I wanna keep digging. - For what?

2042
01:44:50,498 --> 01:44:52,838
-这就是事情真相了  -这不是事实的全部
- This is the goddamn story. - It's not the whole story.

2043
01:44:52,838 --> 01:44:54,638
这很棘手啊 我们没剩下多少时间了
Tough shit. We're on a clock now.

2044
01:44:54,638 --> 01:44:56,408
即使我们不报道斯威尼的判决结果
Even if we don't run Sweeney's ruling,

2045
01:44:56,408 --> 01:44:58,638
其他报社也可能会发现这些信件 抢先报道
another paper could find these letters and fuck the story.

2046
01:44:58,648 --> 01:45:00,848
我知道 但如果我们单独报道这些信件
Agreed. But we run these letters alone,

2047
01:45:00,848 --> 01:45:04,148
劳会道歉 说只发生过一次 他可以把真相掩盖起来
law apologizes, says it's a one-time thing. He can bury it.

2048
01:45:04,148 --> 01:45:07,648
怎么掩盖 这些信件证明了他知道罪行却毫无作为
How? These clearly show he knew and did nothing about it.

2049
01:45:07,648 --> 01:45:10,858
听着 我快要把全部七十个神父的丑闻挖到底了
Look, I'm close to stories on 70 priests.

2050
01:45:10,858 --> 01:45:13,688
我们把那些全部搞定后 再加上这些信件
We nail that, along with those letters,

2051
01:45:13,688 --> 01:45:17,198
就能证明此事不只是劳的过失
this is proof that this is bigger than law.

2052
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:19,798
而且是整个体系的腐坏
It's the whole system.

2053
01:45:19,798 --> 01:45:22,268
你有足够证据证明全部神父的罪过吗
You have multiple sources confirming all those priests?

2054
01:45:22,268 --> 01:45:25,868
-有一部分了 我可以拿到更多 -太冒险了
- On some. I can get more. - Too risky.

2055
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:27,228
如果我们不把他们每个人
If we're not buttoned up on every

2056
01:45:27,228 --> 01:45:29,268
挖的底朝天 教会就会挑我们的毛病
single one of them, the church will pick us apart.

2057
01:45:31,038 --> 01:45:33,708
我可以为我们争取到教会那边的一个证人
I think I can get us someone from the other side of the aisle.

2058
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,548
教会内部的人吗
Somebody inside the church?

2059
01:45:36,548 --> 01:45:38,378
是的 一名律师
Yeah. A lawyer.

2060
01:45:38,388 --> 01:45:40,488
他愿意公开证明吗
Will he go on the record?

2061
01:45:40,488 --> 01:45:42,948
他背景很深 但值得信赖
Deep background. But he's a solid source.

2062
01:45:46,558 --> 01:45:48,888
雷赞德斯需要时间来写报道
Rezendes needs time to write the story.

2063
01:45:48,898 --> 01:45:51,798
我们不能在圣诞节披露 尤其是九・一一事件过后
We don't want to drop it at Christmas, not after 9/11.

2064
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:54,828
我们可以在新年后报导
We could run it just after new year's,

2065
01:45:54,838 --> 01:45:57,698
赶在他们公布剩下的文件之前
before they release the rest of the documents.

2066
01:46:01,068 --> 01:46:03,008
好的
All right.

2067
01:46:03,008 --> 01:46:06,108
告诉卡内洛斯别报道这次裁决了
Tell Canellos to bury the ruling in Metro.

2068
01:46:07,578 --> 01:46:09,548
你有六周时间
You got six weeks.

2069
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:11,918
谢谢
Thank you.

2070
01:46:11,918 --> 01:46:14,248
告诉麦克在圣诞节前将初稿交给我
Tell Mike I want a draft by Christmas.

2071
01:46:14,248 --> 01:46:16,388
我们还需要教堂方面的回应
And we need a response from lake street.

2072
01:46:16,388 --> 01:46:18,588
红衣主教的公关是谁 还是约翰・沃什吗
Who does PR for the cardinal? Still John Walsh?

2073
01:46:18,588 --> 01:46:22,188
不是 是个新人 叫唐娜・莫里西 之前在TV网任职 她还很年轻
No, somebody new. Donna Morrissey. She came from TV. She's young.

2074
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:23,098
好的 去做一份引述
Good. Get a quote. We

2075
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:25,028
我们得准备点劳的言论 以示公正
need something from law to appear evenhanded.

2076
01:46:25,028 --> 01:46:27,498
罗比 下次得提前给我提个醒
Robby, next time give me a goddamn heads-up.

2077
01:46:27,498 --> 01:46:29,698
好的
Will do.

2078
01:47:52,018 --> 01:47:54,848
罗比 真是稀客啊
Robby, what a nice surprise.

2079
01:47:54,858 --> 01:47:56,418
快请进
Come on in.

2080
01:48:02,658 --> 01:48:06,198
嘿 亲爱的 看看是谁来了
Hey, hon, look who I found outside.

2081
01:48:08,798 --> 01:48:11,168
凯伦 能让我们单独待会儿吗
Karen, can you give us a minute?

2082
01:48:12,198 --> 01:48:15,338
-当然 -见到你很高兴 凯伦
- Sure. - Good to see you, Karen.

2083
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:20,108
什么事
What's up?

2084
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:37,398
我快没时间了 吉姆
I'm out of time, Jim.

2085
01:48:37,398 --> 01:48:40,728
我们已经写好了七十位神父的丑闻报道
We've got cover-up stories on 70 priests.

2086
01:48:40,728 --> 01:48:42,448
但我的上级要求
But the boss isn't gonna run

2087
01:48:42,448 --> 01:48:45,138
必须得到你们这边的证实后才能披露
it unless I get confirmation from your side.

2088
01:48:47,368 --> 01:48:49,038
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

2089
01:48:49,038 --> 01:48:51,678
拜托了 这是我们的城市啊 吉米
Come on. This is our town, Jimmy.

2090
01:48:51,678 --> 01:48:56,748
每个人都知道有罪恶在发生 可没人有所行动
Everybody knew something was going on, and no one did a thing.

2091
01:48:56,748 --> 01:49:00,688
-我们必须结束这一切 -不用你来提醒我该做什么
- We gotta put an end to it. - Don't tell me what I gotta do.

2092
01:49:00,688 --> 01:49:03,858
没错 我是帮这些卑鄙小人做了辩护 但那是我的职责所在 罗比
Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags, but that's my job, Robby.

2093
01:49:03,858 --> 01:49:06,288
我只是在尽职
I was doing my job.

2094
01:49:07,358 --> 01:49:09,428
是啊
Yeah.

2095
01:49:09,428 --> 01:49:11,158
你跟其他人一样
You and everyone else.

2096
01:49:19,768 --> 01:49:21,508
滚出我的房子
Get out of my house.

2097
01:49:32,518 --> 01:49:34,018
嘿
Hey!

2098
01:49:35,448 --> 01:49:38,188
你来我家就为了说这些的吗
You come to my home and lay this shit on me?

2099
01:49:39,088 --> 01:49:41,358
你说得对 罗比
You were right, Robby.

2100
01:49:41,358 --> 01:49:44,298
每个人都知道有罪恶发生
We all knew something was going on.

2101
01:49:44,298 --> 01:49:48,528
那你当时在哪里呢 你为什么耽误了这么久
So where were you? What took you so long?

2102
01:49:54,868 --> 01:49:56,468
我不知道 吉姆
I don't know, Jim.

2103
01:50:01,648 --> 01:50:04,048
把名单给我
Give me the list.

2104
01:50:59,038 --> 01:51:01,438
拉里 我们六小时后就要报道了
Larry, we're going to press in six hours.

2105
01:51:01,438 --> 01:51:02,328
唐娜・莫里西几小时前说
Donna Morrissey said she'd

2106
01:51:02,338 --> 01:51:03,708
她会打给我们 转述劳的声明
call us with a quote from law hours ago.

2107
01:51:03,708 --> 01:51:06,178
-我也以为 -你是什么时候跟她说的
- That's what I thought. - When did you talk to her?

2108
01:51:06,178 --> 01:51:08,378
-好的 好的 拉里 -好的
- Okay. Okay, Larry. - Yeah.

2109
01:51:08,378 --> 01:51:11,718
好 好的 这是个好消息 谢谢你 皮特
Yeah. Yeah, that's good to know. Thanks, Pete.

2110
01:51:11,718 --> 01:51:13,478
有什么新动向吗
Anything?

2111
01:51:13,488 --> 01:51:15,178
康利说唐娜・莫里西早该打电话过来的
Conley said Donna Morrissey should've called.

2112
01:51:15,178 --> 01:51:16,118
他刚离开教堂
He just left lake street.

2113
01:51:16,118 --> 01:51:18,018
是啊 拉斯基也是这么说的
Yeah, Rasky said the same thing.

2114
01:51:18,018 --> 01:51:20,328
这太可笑了 你觉得他们还想先下手为强
This is ridiculous. You'd think they want to get ahead of this.

2115
01:51:20,328 --> 01:51:22,458
我是说 他们要不提前采取行动才是傻呢
I mean, they'd be idiots not to.

2116
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:25,658
我真想看看他们读了我们的报道之后的表情
I would love to see their faces when they read this thing.

2117
01:51:25,668 --> 01:51:28,198
星期天可是盛大的主显节呢
You know,Sunday's the feast of the epiphany.

2118
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:31,038
那挺合适的
That seems appropriate.

2119
01:51:35,808 --> 01:51:37,408
我是麦克・雷赞德斯
Mike Rezendes.

2120
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:40,578
你好 唐娜
Hey, Donna.

2121
01:51:40,578 --> 01:51:41,748
感谢你的来电 是啊
Thanks for calling. Yeah,

2122
01:51:41,748 --> 01:51:43,978
如果你有空的话 我想问几个问题
I just had a few questions if you have a minute.

2123
01:51:46,318 --> 01:51:47,448
什么
What?

2124
01:51:48,848 --> 01:51:51,418
-怎么了  -又有个形容词使用不当
- What? - Another adjective.

2125
01:51:52,888 --> 01:51:54,928
-有什么消息吗 -劳刚刚回绝了我们的提问
- Anything? - Law just turned us down.

2126
01:51:54,928 --> 01:51:56,528
天啊
Jesus Christ.

2127
01:51:56,528 --> 01:51:58,658
我刚和唐娜・莫里西通完电话
I just got off the phone with Donna Morrissey.

2128
01:51:58,668 --> 01:52:00,008
引述如下 “我们连问题是什么
She said, quote, "We don't even

2129
01:52:00,008 --> 01:52:02,098
都没有兴趣知道” 转述完毕
want to know what the questions are," End quote.

2130
01:52:02,098 --> 01:52:03,938
-她真的这样说吗 -是的
- She really said that? - Yeah.

2131
01:52:03,938 --> 01:52:05,668
嗯 这样也行
Well, that ought to do it.

2132
01:52:05,668 --> 01:52:07,408
“教会对于《环球报》的疑问
"The church had no interest

2133
01:52:07,408 --> 01:52:10,068
表示毫无兴趣”
in knowing what the globe's questions would be."

2134
01:52:11,278 --> 01:52:13,778
把这句话加到重点内容前面 还有别的吗
Work it in somewhere before the jump. Anything else?

2135
01:52:13,778 --> 01:52:15,258
马特想把信件放到网上
Matt wants to put the letters

2136
01:52:15,258 --> 01:52:17,548
以供读者自行查阅
online so the readers can see for themselves.

2137
01:52:17,548 --> 01:52:20,078
我们可以在文章最后附上网址链接
We can run the url at the bottom of the article.

2138
01:52:20,088 --> 01:52:21,948
-这样挺方便的 -好的
- It's pretty straightforward. - Okay.

2139
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,218
我们还可以把办公室的专线电话
We also put the spotlight tip

2140
01:52:23,228 --> 01:52:25,458
放在文末 方便大家打进来
line at the end of the story so people can call in.

2141
01:52:25,458 --> 01:52:26,958
直接打到我们办公室来
Goes directly to our office.

2142
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:29,458
我和马特也可以一早就来 以便接电话
Matt and I can go in in the morning in case we get any calls.

2143
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,628
嗯 我更担心接待处的电话
Yeah, I'm more concerned about the phones at reception.

2144
01:52:31,628 --> 01:52:32,888
在我们报道了波特案之后
After we ran the Porter case,

2145
01:52:32,888 --> 01:52:34,768
电话中心好几周都忙得不可开交
the message centers were tied up for weeks.

2146
01:52:34,768 --> 01:52:36,938
-这是个问题 -纠察员也是个问题
- It's a real problem. - There were picketers too.

2147
01:52:36,938 --> 01:52:38,398
大家都很忙
Lots of 'em.

2148
01:52:38,408 --> 01:52:40,638
我会跟理查德谈安保工作和电话问题的
I'll talk to Richard about the security and the phones.

2149
01:52:40,638 --> 01:52:43,468
呃 后续报道要怎样进行
Uh, how are we coming on the folo story?

2150
01:52:43,478 --> 01:52:47,048
嗯 我们把全部七十个神父的报道都搞定了
Well, we've nailed down multiple stories on 70 priests.

2151
01:52:47,948 --> 01:52:49,748
-全部七十个吗  -嗯
- All 70? - Mm-hmm.

2152
01:52:49,748 --> 01:52:52,318
而且拿到了罗比线人的证明 我们随时可以报道了
And with confirmation from Robby's source, we're ready to go.

2153
01:52:52,318 --> 01:52:54,548
我们下周内可以写好初稿
We can have a draft next week.

2154
01:52:54,548 --> 01:52:58,218
罗比 那位给你提供消息的人 我们可以重访吗
Robby, that source of yours, is it something we could revisit?

2155
01:52:59,828 --> 01:53:01,588
可能有点困难
It might be tough.

2156
01:53:01,588 --> 01:53:02,858
那他给几十个下贱的神父
But he has no problem helping

2157
01:53:02,858 --> 01:53:04,728
打掩护时就不困难了吗
the church protect dozens of dirty priests.

2158
01:53:04,728 --> 01:53:07,598
-那家伙可真卑鄙 -他是一名律师 他只是在做他应做的
- Guy's a scumbag. - He's a lawyer. He's doing his job.

2159
01:53:07,598 --> 01:53:10,098
-他就是教会雇佣的骗子 -他是在助纣为虐
- He's a shill for the church. - He knew and did nothing.

2160
01:53:10,098 --> 01:53:12,668
他本可以早点说出来 也许还能救回几条命
He could've said something years ago, maybe saved some lives.

2161
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:15,438
那我们呢
What about us?

2162
01:53:15,438 --> 01:53:18,178
-这是什么意思 -我们早就有不少线索了
- What's that supposed to mean? - We had all the pieces.

2163
01:53:18,178 --> 01:53:20,238
为什么没能早点发掘真相呢
Why didn't we get it sooner?

2164
01:53:20,248 --> 01:53:22,408
-我们哪里有很多线索了 -我们有萨维亚诺
- We didn't have all the pieces. - We had saviano.

2165
01:53:22,418 --> 01:53:24,248
巴雷特和吉欧根
We had Barrett. We had Geoghan.

2166
01:53:24,248 --> 01:53:26,178
还有地下室里那些人名录
We had the directories in the basement.

2167
01:53:26,188 --> 01:53:27,958
这样说吧 我们现在有了结果
You know what? We got it now.

2168
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:30,018
罗比 这个报道需要聚焦小组的努力
Robby, the story needed spotlight.

2169
01:53:30,018 --> 01:53:33,358
麦克 这个组1970年就成立了
Mike, spotlight's been around since 1970.

2170
01:53:33,358 --> 01:53:36,358
那又怎样 我们又没办法预知未来 没人可以
So what? We couldn't see the scope of this. No one could.

2171
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:38,728
罗比 这是由一个该死的神父牵扯出来的
Robby, this started with one goddamn priest.

2172
01:53:41,268 --> 01:53:44,198
麦克利什几年前寄来过一封信 检举了二十个神父
Macleish sent us a letter on 20 priests years ago.

2173
01:53:44,198 --> 01:53:46,138
萨夏找到了剪报
Sacha found the clip.

2174
01:53:46,138 --> 01:53:48,208
你开什么玩笑 二十名神父吗
You freaking kidding? Twenty priests?

2175
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,868
什么时候
When?

2176
01:53:51,038 --> 01:53:54,108
呃 就在波特案之后 93年12月
Uh, just after Porter. December '93.

2177
01:53:54,108 --> 01:53:56,848
我们把这事给了《都市报》 没有进行后续报道
We buried the story in Metro. No folo.

2178
01:53:57,948 --> 01:53:59,548
是你吗
That was you?

2179
01:54:00,848 --> 01:54:02,448
你那时是《都市报》的主管
You were Metro.

2180
01:54:03,558 --> 01:54:06,388
是的 是我
Yeah. That was me.

2181
01:54:06,388 --> 01:54:08,888
我那时刚接管 完全不记得有这回事
I'd just taken over. I don't remember it at all.

2182
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:11,458
但是 没错
But yeah.

2183
01:54:14,728 --> 01:54:16,898
嗯
Um,

2184
01:54:16,898 --> 01:54:19,638
我能不能 呃 说几句
can I, uh, say something here?

2185
01:54:20,838 --> 01:54:22,668
有时候我们很容易就忘记了
Sometimes it's easy to forget

2186
01:54:22,678 --> 01:54:26,208
很多时候我们都在黑暗边缘徘徊
that we spend most of our time stumbling around in the dark.

2187
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:27,848
一旦光明降临
Suddenly a light gets turned on,

2188
01:54:27,848 --> 01:54:30,918
罪人自会接受惩罚
and there's a fair share of blame to go around.

2189
01:54:32,888 --> 01:54:35,418
我无法对调任此地之前的事情作过多评论
I can't speak to what happened before I arrived,

2190
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:40,588
但是 呃 你们所有人都为这次的报道贡献颇多
but, uh, all of you have done some very good reporting here.

2191
01:54:40,588 --> 01:54:43,258
这类报道能够迅速引起读者
Reporting that I believe is gonna have an immediate

2192
01:54:43,258 --> 01:54:46,328
大范围的关注
and considerable impact on our readers.

2193
01:54:48,268 --> 01:54:51,768
于我而言 这就是我们新闻行业的价值所在
For me, this kind of story is why we do this.

2194
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:53,368
我说过
Having said that,

2195
01:54:53,368 --> 01:54:55,538
劳主教和天主教社区
cardinal law and the catholic community

2196
01:54:55,538 --> 01:54:57,908
肯定会对此事有强烈的反应
are gonna have a very strong response to this.

2197
01:54:59,038 --> 01:55:01,278
所以 如果你们需要休息
So if you need a moment,

2198
01:55:01,278 --> 01:55:03,048
完全没问题
you've earned it.

2199
01:55:03,048 --> 01:55:05,578
但是 呃
But, uh,

我 呃 刚刚接到了红衣主教的电话
I, uh, just got a call from the cardinal.

2204
01:55:30,738 --> 01:55:32,638
真的吗 为什么
Really. Why?

2205
01:55:32,648 --> 01:55:36,048
他想亲自告诉我 他决定不对此事做任何评论
He wanted to tell me personally that he decided not to comment.

2206
01:55:36,048 --> 01:55:40,818
他还说 他愿意 呃 增加给我的好处
Yeah. Said he wanted to, uh, extend me that courtesy.

2207
01:55:40,818 --> 01:55:44,158
天哪 那家伙可真有胆量 你是怎么说的
Jesus, the balls on that guy. What did you say?

2208
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:45,558
我跟他说 他这么做是错的
I told him he was making a

2209
01:55:45,558 --> 01:55:47,988
而且我们肯定会把这件事报道出来
mistake and that we were gonna run the story.

2210
01:55:47,988 --> 01:55:50,228
我们当然要报道这事
Damn right we're gonna run it.

2211
01:56:14,518 --> 01:56:16,688
