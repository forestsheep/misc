那东西都过时了  而且还贵得要命
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

只是后来贵了  九十年代的时候很便宜

所以如果认真找找的话...
So, if you look hard enough...

00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,010
"这就是原型机与

I'll let you call it.

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,900
如果将其应用于其他材料
If you think about the applications on other materials,

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,930
效果会相当明显
it could be fairly significant.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,360
比如说  金属制品
Metals, for instance,

75
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,030
受微小的力或噪音干扰就会被粉碎
can be shattered with very little effort or noise.

Yeah, this project started as a request from Seal Team 6.

79
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,200
自卢旺达的围城以后
After the siege in Rwanda,

80
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,330
他们就来问我们能否
they came to us asking for the capability to

瞬间冻结或汽化敌人的水源
flash freeze or boil the enemy's water supply.

82
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,200
如今这个装置可以将敌人们赶出来了
Now, this device could have driven the enemy out.

83
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,150
你有在活体上测试过吗
And you... tried this on living things?

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,660
这不是我们的初衷

85

希望你们能测试一下

Yeah. Right this way.

91

你是想良心无愧吗
What do you want, a clean conscience?

92
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,660
就算用块牛肉来测试它  我也不在乎
Test it with a slab of beef for all I care.

93
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,830
我只希望不要背离了我们的设计初衷
What I want is to use it for what we originally designed it as.

94

95
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,450

是我们赖以为生的产业
It's the business we're in.

98
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,360
你记得当初雇用我时说的套话吗
Remember what you sold it to me as when you hired me?

99

致力于防御
Defense.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
还是有部分属实的
And that's still partially true.

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,800
但战争是桩好生意
But war is good business.

And if you ask him, I don't think

110
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,730
我想他不会觉得那是他最辉煌的时刻
he thought that was his finest hour.

想过要研究有全感知反馈的义肢吗
Ever think about prosthetic limbs with full sensory feedback?

-说了  -很好
- I did. - Good.

那你可以开始收拾行李了
Then you can start packing.

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,660
国家独立了  但内部纷争不断
It became independent, but it's struggling internally.

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
一方面  是叛军作乱
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

157
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,700
全都是政府的前精锐部队
made up of the regime's former elite soldiers.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,780
他们全都训练有素且极度危险
They're well-trained and dangerous.

159
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
另一方面  这里的大部分国民
On the other, you have most of the population,

160
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
都想推翻政府的统治
who are tearing down the regime's flags

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
渴望新政府
and demanding a new government.

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,790
不管有多复杂
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,

163
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,960
内乱是我们所熟悉的事情
is a business we're familiar with.

164
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,700
我们觉得自己擅长处理内乱
We like to think we're good at it.

165
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,730
但是你的摄像机发现的这个...
But this thing your camera found...

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,300
是种全新的玩意儿
It's a whole new piece of business.

167
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,340
我没法把这个视频交给美军欧洲司令部
I can't send this video to EUCOM.

168
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,230
我只是担心他们会认为这是个玩笑
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
国防部没有幽默感
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,030
通常没有  帮我们装好
Typically not. Hook us up.

171
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,960
我相信这些东西有科学的解释
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation for what's on these,

172
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,030
但是在你告诉我之前
but until you tell me,

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
我是不会把它上交指挥系统的
I'm not sending it up the chain of command.

174
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,130
-搞定了  -是的  长官
- You done? - Yes, sir.

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
-出去把我们锁好  在外面等着  -是
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside. - Sir.

176
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
这里没有人对这个有任何头绪
Nobody here has been able to make heads or tails of this.

177
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,160
由于一些我无法随意告知你的原因
It's thrown a wrench into our entire operation

178
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,830
我们的整个行动都被搅乱了
for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss with you.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,730
我只能告诉你我们急需解释
I can tell you we need answers fast.

180
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
-介意我来吗  -你这么快就看到了
- Do you mind? - You spotted that quick.

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,900
五个头盔摄像机
Five different helmet cams

182
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,360
在过去三周内拍到了相似的东西
picked up something similar in the last three weeks.

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,170
最初情报技术人员
At first, our signals

184
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
认为那是干扰信号
intelligence tech wrote it off as interference.

185
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,330
那可不是干扰信号
That's not interference.

186
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
我觉得要是干扰信号的话
I don't think you'd fly me all the way here

187
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,660
不会让我大老远飞到这里来
for interference.

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,130
想跟我说说你的想法吗
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
我想让你先说出你的想法
I want you to tell me what you're thinking.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
我...暂时没什么想法
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,630
但这总是有解释的
But there is an explanation.

192
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,730
这是第一次观测到的画面  另外三次类似
That was the first sighting. Three others just like it.

193
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,180
最后一次有些不同
The last was different.

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,130
因为牵扯到一位三角洲部队成员
It involved a member of Delta Force,

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,960
这让事情变得极其敏感
that makes it particularly sensitive.

196
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,100
这位是中情局的弗兰·麦迪逊
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

197
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,700
这里的特别行动都是中情局的秘密任务
What special ops does here is done under CIA covert operations.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
在我们继续之前你得把这个签了
You need to sign this before we go any further.

199
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,330
-这是什么  -敏感信息保证书
- What is this? - It's an SCI oath.

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,090
如果你泄露了
You're acknowledging it's life

201
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,330
告诉你的任何事  你将被判终身监禁
in prison if you reveal anything you're told.

202
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,130
{\an8}{\pos(317,232)}敏感信息隔离设施

203
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,700
-找到戴维斯的文件  -是  长官
- Cue up the Davis file, please. - Yes, ma'am.

204
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
三天前我们中城区进行了一次突击行动
Three days ago we conducted a raid in mid-city.

205
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,390
我们的通讯时断时续
Our communications were intermittent,

206
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,260
有一位队员与队伍失联了
and a guy got separated from the group...

207
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
最终他在行动中被杀
Where he ended up killed in action.

208
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,300
他比任何人离得都近
He got closer than anybody.

209
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
太近了
Too close.

210
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
这里是D组1队  你们看到了吗
Dagger team 1, you seeing this?

211
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,630
这里有东西在干扰信号
There's some kind of disturbance here.

212
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,630
戴维斯  什么东西  你看到什么了
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

213
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,000
见鬼
What the hell?

214
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,930
克里斯·戴维斯中士
Sergeant Chris Davis.

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,260
经历过三次战争的老兵  精英中的精英
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

216
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,800
最近几周我们在全城范围内都发现了
In the last few weeks we've been finding bodies around the city

217
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
死法相同的尸体
that were killed in the same way.

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
尸检无法得出结论
The autopsies defied all explanation.

219
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,730
他们的内脏被冰冻住
Their internal organs were frozen

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,830
然而皮肤却被烧灼和腐蚀了
and yet, their skin was burned and corroded.

221
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
从摩尔多瓦友军方面
The only response from the allied

222
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,660
得到的唯一回应  只有震惊和困惑
Moldovan military contact is shock, confusion.

223
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,930
还有愤怒
And there's anger.

224
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,690
有一些少年
There's teenagers

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,330
在出事地点喷涂"灭绝幽魂"的记号
spray-painting "Genocide Aratare" at kill sites.

226
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,730
-灭绝什么  -"幽魂"
- Genocide...? - "Aratare."

227
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,330
当地的传说  战争的鬼魂
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,300
"如同噩梦一般"  大概是这个意思
"As nightmarish as." That's the literal translation.

229
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,160
-还很有诗意  -那是他们的迷信
- That's very poetic. - Well, they're superstitious.

230
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,030
他们不知怎地认为...
They somehow think...

231
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,760
战争的恐怖唤醒了一些非自然的力量
the horrors of the war have kicked up something unnatural.

232
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,360
-我们希望你能给出别的理论  -你怎么看
- We hope you have an alternate theory. - What do you think?

233
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,390
我认为你们得给它们起个新名字
Think you need a new name for them.

234
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,900
除了这个
Beyond that.

235
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,290
给我一份这些数据的拷贝  给我点时间
Give me a copy of the data, some time...

236
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,700
不可能
That's not possible.

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,800
你们想让我现在就搞清楚
You want me to figure this out right now?

238
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,100
-我们需要你的看法  -我还没什么看法
- We want your assessment. - I don't have one yet.

239
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,490
那么  我们就得把目前的理论
Then, I think we have to send our working theory

240
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,600
上交给指挥系统
up the chain of command.

241
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,710
我不想这样做
I don't wanna do that.

242
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,230
好吧  目前的理论是什么
Okay. What is your working theory?

243
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,660
我们认为这是一种隐身技术
The agency thinks this is some kind of cloaking technology.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,230
叛军士兵穿着动态伪装服
Insurgent soldiers wearing active camouflage.

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,230
在这个国家吗  那么先进的技术
In this country? Something that advanced?

246
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,710
中情局知道欧洲和亚洲的
CIA knows a few groups in Europe

247
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,800
一些组织可能在研究动态伪装服
and Asia could be working on active camouflage.

248
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,230
国防部高级研究计划局也在研究隐形技术
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,000
我们离原型都还差好多年
We're years away from a prototype.

250
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
也许有人领先了你们
Maybe somebody beat you to it.

251
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,330
我们已经是这个领域最先进的了
DARPA is the leader in the field.

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
你确定吗
Are you certain of that?

253
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,800
地方政府斥巨资进行武器研究
The regime spent heavily on weapons research.

254
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
腐败  松散的法治
Corruption, loose legislation.

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,260
对一个想要低调的军事实验室来说
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

256
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,830
-这里是悄悄进行研究的完美地点  -好吧
- This is a great place to work and hide. - Okay.

257
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,260
我们假设这是一种隐身技术
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,680
怎么解释死因
How do you account for cause of death?

259
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,260
对受害者的冲击波
A shock delivered to the victim.

260
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
我觉得你只是瞎猜的
I think you're reaching.

261
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,660
我们的工作需要进行推测
Our business requires us to make suppositions.

262
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,600
而我的工作需要去证实这些推测
My business requires us to prove them.

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
你们的技术人员的工作是找到故障
Your technician's job is to find glitches,

264
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,760
所以他们看到了故障
so, he sees glitches.

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,210
你们的工作是找到敌人
Your job is to find the enemy,

266
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,300
所以你们看到了敌人
so, you see the enemy.

267
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,360
本地人相信鬼魂  他们就看到了鬼魂
Locals believe in spirits, so they see spirits.

268
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,030
在某一方面  每个人都有自己的偏见
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

269
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,390
所以  现在我的回答是
So, my answer to you right

270
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,660
我们目前缺少数据来支持任何理论
now is that we lack data to support any theory.

271
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
好吧
Okay.

272
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,930
你需要什么来得出更肯定的结论
What do you need to make a more definitive statement?

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,300
首先  你们得有更好的画面
First, you need a better shot.

274
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,630
这正是我想要的  更好的画面
That's what I'm looking for, a better shot.

275
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,260
怎么做
How?

276
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,230
-这边  长官  -就是这个
- Right here, sir. - That's it.

277
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,230
我从DARPA带来了这个  超光谱摄像机
I brought this from DARPA. A hyperspectral camera.

278
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,260
比你们用的头盔摄像机更强大的设备
A more powerful version of the helmet cams your guys are using.

279
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
它能看到深层次的光谱
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,740
不管是否可见  只要有东西
Visible or invisible, if something's there,

281
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,600
它就能观察到
this'll pick it up.

282
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,260
你能把这东西安在三角洲部队的战车上吗
Can you mount this thing... on a delta vehicle?

283
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,300
-当然可以  -很好
- I don't see why not. - All right, good.

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
我们每天在城里都有行动
We run missions into the city every day.

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,630
我把战地技术人员找来  你教他怎么操作
I'll put you with our field tech, tell him how to operate it.

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,160
我不想让我之外的第二个人来操作这部摄像机
I wouldn't put a tech in between this camera and myself.

287
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,060
那你想亲自操作
So, you wanna operate it?

288
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,370
要想拍到关键画面...
If you want that kill shot...

289
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,600
需要快速的临场反应
you'll need a fast reaction time out there.

290
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,700
下次行动  你跟三角洲部队一起
Next mission, you ride with delta.

291
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,610
他们会带你接近那东西
They're gonna get you close to this thing.

292
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,100
等你给我搞到关键画面
You get me the kill shot...

293
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,060
你就可以直接拎包回弗吉尼亚
you can go home to Virginia without unpacking.

294
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,630
有个转子坏了  你得把它换掉
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

295
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
把它焊在前面板上
Weld it onto the front panel.

296
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,200
瞧瞧这个
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

297
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,200
-这家伙在做什么  -我不知道
- What's this guy up to, man? - I don't know.

298
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,600
你相信这家伙吗
Believe this guy?

299
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,330
-如果有作用的话  -说真的
- If it works. - For real.

300
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,130
听说你要在我们的车上装个摄像机
Heard you're installing a camera on our truck.

301
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
要是你不把50口径机枪拆下来我本来没意见
Which was fine until you ripped out that 50 Cal.

302
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
你拆了把枪换了部摄像机上去
You're taking down a gun to put up a camera?

303
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,200
只有那里有空间放置摄像机
It's the only place large enough to mount it.

304
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,130
你们能明白吧  我知道这听起来像个坏主意
You guys get that, right? I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

305
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,110
我们更喜欢跟带我们的人合作
We prefer to dance with who brung us...

306
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,930
克莱恩博士  懂了吗
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,230
"跟带你们的人合作"  我并不懂
"Dance with who brung you"? No, actually, I don't.

308
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
这辆车救过我们的命很多次
This truck has saved our lives, many times.

309
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
我明白
I understand.

310
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
你们知道这辆车是克莱恩博士的团队制造的吗
You guys know Dr. Clyne's team built that truck?

311
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,700
克莱恩博士在DARPA工作
Clyne works over at DARPA.

312
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,170
我跟他的团队紧密合作过
I've worked closely with his group.

313
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,200
去过他们在弗吉尼亚的设施
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

314
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,400
很高兴见到你  克莱恩博士
Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.

315
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,660
我也是  卡布瑞拉上尉
Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

316
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,960
他们给这些车改装了更坚固轻便的装甲
They retrofitted these trucks with tougher, lighter weight armor.

317
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,960
他们设计了装载机来搬运重物
They designed the mechanical loaders that do the heavy lifting,

318
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,200
给你们省了力气
so you boys don't strain yourselves too hard.

319
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,330
事实上  克莱恩博士本人
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,660
还设计了轻薄的凯夫拉连体紧身衣
developed the thin weight Kevlar body stocking that literally...

321
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
来保护你们的蛋蛋
protects your balls.

322
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,390
我希望你们
So, I would think there'd be

323
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,000
都能对克莱恩博士心存感激
nothing but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

324
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,200
-塞申斯少校  -上尉  让你的人退下
- Major Sessions. - Captain, have your men fall back.

325
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,360
-都散开  -把它放下
- Get back to it. - Get it done.

326
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,330
少校  这位是克莱恩博士
Major, this is Dr. Clyne.

327
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,300
在过去五年他和我们合作过多次
He's worked with us eight or ten times over the last five years.

328
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,060
你要和突击队一起去击杀鬼影吗
You go out with the assault team on hunting ghost?

329
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
不  长官
No, sir.

330
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,760
他是个好人  少校
He's a good man, major.

331
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,100
很好  但我不喜欢带游客执行作战任务
That's great. I'm just not a fan of taking tourists on combat missions.

332
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,600
长官  我不是游客
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

333
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,230
如果没携带突击步枪  那你就是个游客
If you're not carrying an M4, you're a tourist.

334
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
如果你坚持  我可以配枪
I can carry one, if you'd like.

335
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,600
少校  我们得把克莱恩博士带去战场
Major, we gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

336
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,900
这样他才能追踪目标  帮助我们击毙它
so he can track the target force and get us a kill shot.

337
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
这个仪器需要多久才能运转
How long before this equipment's operational?

338
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
几个小时吧
A few hours.

339
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,700
-会有用吗  -如果我们离得够近
- Is it gonna work? - If we get close enough.

340
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
戴维斯中士...就离得够近了
Let me tell you something. Sergeant Davis...he got close enough.

341
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,730
他是我们最顶尖的三角洲队员
That's the best delta that we had.

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,100
最好保证你的仪器也是最顶尖的
Make sure your equipment is top-notch this time.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,060
-他们情同手足  -我理解
- They were like brothers. - I get it.

344
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
好吧
Okay.

345
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,030
晚上好  博士
Evening, doc.

346
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,860
听说你俩一见如故
Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

347
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,760
-她可以放松一点  -你也是
- She can come off a bit intense. - Yeah. So can you.

348
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
我来这儿只是帮你们找到这东西
I'm just here to find this thing.

349
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
为了找到它  你都愿意参与作战任务
You're willing to go on a combat mission to find it.

350
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,830
她也是
She is, too.

351
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,160
华盛顿给她施加了太大的压力
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

352
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,830
他们想要答案  而她负责找出答案
They want an answer and it's her job to give them one.

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
在任务名单上看到了你们的名字
Saw your names on a mission roster.

354
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,860
我知道这是最紧要的事
I knew this was a top priority...

355
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,000
但他们把你们俩都派来...
but for them to embed you both...

356
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,100
不用担心我
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,930
我不担心你  博士  我担心这东西
I'm not worried about you, doc. I'm worried about it.

358
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,060
她认为这是一种隐形技术
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

359
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,860
你觉得呢
What do you think it is?

360
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,360
我们都还没想到的某种东西
Something no one's thought of yet.

361
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,330
各位  昨天18点
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

362
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,330
U组去杜勒斯地执行侦察任务时
Utah team left here on a recon mission to Durlesti,

363
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
与叛军交火了
when they were engaged by insurgents.

364
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,230
我们设法弄清交火时他们说了什么
We managed to hear most of their chatter during the firefight,

365
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
但结果并不理想
but comes were unreliable.

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,900
目标是这里的一栋五层建筑
Target is a five-story apartment building here.

367
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,030
我们认为活着的U组队员被关押在四楼
We think what's left of utah team is being held on the fourth floor,

368
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,860
位于西北角的房间里
in the northwest corner apartment.

369
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,260
我们将深入叛军占领区域
We're gonna be knee-deep in an insurgent-held area in the city.

370
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,330
所以  做好交战准备
So, we should expect a fight.

371
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,130
最后一件事
One last thing.

372
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,070
我们的人被抓住之前
Before our guys were grabbed,

373
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,600
通过无线电汇报了看到的东西
they radioed in that they saw

374
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
我们称之为  超光谱异形物
what we're now calling hyperspectral anomalies.

375
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,010
此次任务要速战速决
Your mission is a quick extraction.

376
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,700
找到U组队员  带他们出来
You get our guys and you get out.

377
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,160
如果交火  将异形物就地消灭
However, if engaged, neutralize the anomalies in the area.

378
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
消灭他们
Neutralize them?

379
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,200
-怎么消灭  -我们要对付的是什么
- How? - Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

380
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,830
我们认为是穿着先进电子伪装服的敌方士兵
We believe these are enemy soldiers in advanced electronic camouflage.

381
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,190
所以  交火时务必小心  如果他们...
So, be surgical when you fire. If they are...

382
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,740
如果不清楚他们是什么  也许我们该...
If we don't really know what they are, maybe we should...

383
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,860
不好意思  你想补充什么吗
Excuse me? Would you like to add something?

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
如果他们穿戴了隐形技术
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

385
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,730
你们要尽可能将其完好无损地带回来
you need to bring it back as intact as possible.

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
克莱恩博士和麦迪逊特工会和你们一起去
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison will be on mission with you.

387
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,760
克莱恩博士会在车队中第二辆反伏击车上
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring your helmet-cam feeds

388
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,800
监测你们头盔摄像机的反馈影像
from the second MRAP vehicle in the convoy.

389
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
塞申斯少校会带领D组1队进行营救
Major Sessions will lead dagger team 1 to do the extraction.

390
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,800

391
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,820

检查武器  比利

没问题
You got it.

395
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,160
这路对你来说不够平坦吗
Our ride not smooth enough for you?

396
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,000
你还敢说自己很厉害[屁股坚硬]And you call yourself hard-ass.

397
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,330
他们真应该重新铺一下这条路  兄弟
They really need to repave these roads, man.

398
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,130
好了  伙计们  我们正在进入废弃区
All right, guys, we're coming into the abandoned zone.

399
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,630
做好面对大批叛军的准备吧
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

400
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
慢点
Okay.

401
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,340
我发现了一具叛军的尸体
I've got an insurgent body here.

402
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,100
我发现了U组的高皮  确认阵亡

403
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,780

-没错  就在那儿  -你就在它上方
- That's it. Right there. - You're right on top of it.

409
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,660
有活动迹象  浴缸下有东西
It's a motion signature. There's something under that tub.

410
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,930
路易斯  浴缸  把浴缸翻过来
Lewis, the tub. I want you to flip over the tub.

411

-你们组的其他人呢  -他们在楼上
- Where's the rest of your team? - They're upstairs.

417
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,800
但他们都死了  钻到皮肤下面了  
But they're all gone. Got under their skin.

像一条冰冻的毛毯
Like a frozen blanket.

421
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,130
-U组的其他人呢  -他们死了
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah? - Oh, they're dead.

-尸体在哪  -我说了  在顶楼
- Where are the bodies? - I told you, they're on the top floor.

425
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
你还没见过它吧
Oh, you haven't seen it.

426
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
我见过了  你知道我信仰上帝  约翰
I've seen it. You know I believe in God, John.

427
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,730
它是上帝的对立面
This is the opposite of god.

428
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,860
等等  这是谁  能让他转个身吗
Wait wait wait. Who's this right there? Can you tell him to turn back?

429
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,040
麦克法登  转过身去
McFadden, turn back.

430
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,260
让我们看看那个房间
Give us a view of that room.

431
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,170
什么也没有  我就站在这儿呢
Nothing's there, guys. I'm standing right here.

432
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,950
麦克  我们正看着它呢
Mac, we're both staring right at it.

433
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
就在你视线中央
It's in the middle of your view port.

434
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,600
什么  那个吗  只是个污点而已
What? That? It's a smear.

435
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,860
大概是这破护目镜的问题
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

436
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,510
不不不  让他戴上护目镜
No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.

437
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,900
麦克  把护目镜戴上
Mac, put the goggles back on.

438
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
麦克  立刻戴上
Mac, do it now.

439
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
-什么情...  -开火
- What the...? - Take the shot.

根本就没有这样的士兵  就算有

人类怎么可能穿着动态伪装服穿过墙壁呢
How does a human wearing active camouflage walk through walls?

562
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,260
或被三个弹夹的穿甲弹打穿都没死

563
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,730
我看到帕特对其中一个打了至少150发

而我们还不知道它是什么东西

566
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
克莱恩
Clyne.

567
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
你见过它
You saw it.

568
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,730
它是什么东西
What was it?

569
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,230
是人类
Human.

570
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,930
有着人类的外形
Had a human form.

571
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,160
它看着我  有自己的意识
It looked at me, it was conscious.

572
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,230
就像个活人
Like a person.

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,760
有什么能解释你看到的东西吗
Is there anything that explains what you saw?

没有
No.

575
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
我们把能用的护目镜收集起来

我的护目镜在撞击中坏了

577

我的也是  撞坏了
Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

578
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,730
别管护目镜了  反正我们也没办法充电
Forget the goggles. We can't recharge them anyway.

579
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,360
那我们怎么办
So, what do we do?

580
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
我们怎么发现它们
How are we supposed to see them?

581
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,930
也许那台摄像机还能帮上忙
Maybe that camera can still help us.

582
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,180
如果能占领制高点
If we get to an elevated position,

583
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,730
情况可能对我们更有利
we'd have a better vantage point.

584
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
来搭把手
Help me with this?

585
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
我们走  行动起来
Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

586
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,630
到处都是
They're everywhere.

587
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,030
有什么东西阻挡住了它们
Something's stopping them.

588
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,930
某种黑色沙土
Some sort of black sand.

589
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,330
我在那沙里摔了一跤
I fell in that sand.

590
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,930
-我把它从手里抠出来了  -让我看看
- I had to... pick it out of my hand. - Let me see it.

591
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,700
-一小片尖锐金属  -是铁屑
- Little, sharp pieces of metal. - They're iron filings.

592
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,630
-纯铁  -是啊
- It's pure iron. - Yeah.

593
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,660
一整条铁屑  围绕房子一圈
And there's a trail of it... All the way around the building.

594
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,360
这是一道屏障  有人把它放在那的
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

595
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,860
看来这里还有人
I don't think we're alone.

596
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,230
整理好装备  我们清理楼上
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

597
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
瞄准就开枪
Point and shoot?

598
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,760
瞄准就开枪
Point and shoot.

599
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,330
突进  突进
Breach! Breach!

600
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,700
-发现儿童  -安全
- I've got kids. - Clear.

601
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,030
-安全  -解除警报
- Clear. - All clear.

602
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
派人守住长墙那里
Tell them to take the long wall.

603
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,760
问他们枪从哪来的  这里还有谁
Ask them where they got this, and who else is here.

604
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,480
问问他们工厂里
Ask them if there's anyone

605
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,730
是否还有其他人  以及他们是否有枪
else in the factory, and do they have guns.

606
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,200
她说只有她们俩在这里
She says they're here alone.

607
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,900
就那一把枪  没有士兵
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

608
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
-一个人都没有  -塞申斯少校
- No one at all. - Major sessions.

609
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,930
出什么问题了
What's the problem?

610
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,700
这工厂有自己的信号塔
This factory has its own transmission tower.

611
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,130
能发出很强的信号
It puts out a huge signal.

612
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,030
有什么问题吗
So, what's the problem?

613
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,600
32公里内的所有人
Everyone within 20 miles

614
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,200
都能听见我们和基地的通话
will hear our conversation with base.

615
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,300
任何叛军的电台都能截获我们的信号
Any insurgent radio will pick up our transmission.

616
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,700
现在最不用担心的就是叛军
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

617
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,960
尽快和奥伦德将军取得联系
Connect me to General Orland as soon as possible.

618

呼叫基地  这里是D组

622
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,490
呼叫基地  这里是D组

你们是我们的新兵
You guys are our new recruits.

625
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,700
相信我  你们能帮上大忙
And believe me... we could use the help.

626
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
来吧  小铁汉  看看你有什么本事
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

627
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,630
我得问你些事儿
Hey, I need to ask you something.

628
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,860
外面的屏障  是你的主意吗
Was it your idea... to put the barrier... outside?

629
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,030
是他们父亲  他们父亲知道
Their father. Their father knew.

630
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,390
他们父亲沿着建筑外围
Their father rolled open barrels of the iron shavings

631
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,200
撒了几桶铁屑
around the building.

632
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,330
他救了他们的命
He saved their lives.

633
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,360
你父亲呢
What happened to your father?

634
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,160
你是个小拳击手是吧
You're a little scrapper, aren't you?

635
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,260
伙计  你没事吧  继续  站起来
Hey, buddy, you all right? Come on, get up.

636
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
你在做什么
What are you doing?

637
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
你是鬼魂吗
Are you a ghost?

638
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,000
幽魂
Aratare.

639
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,210
他说别说那个词
He says, "Don't say that word."

640
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,830
问他那些东西是什么
Ask him what they are.

641
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
失落的灵魂
Lost souls.

642
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,060
死者的灵魂
Souls of the dead.

643
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,650
被困在生与死之间
They're trapped between life and death,

644
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,230
无法安息
and they can't find peace.

645
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,300
为什么会这样
How's that happen?

646
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,860
他说是因为战争
He says, "War."

647
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
过来
Come on.

648
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,930
如果是他们的父亲撒下了那些铁屑
If their father was the one who put down the iron shavings,

649
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,260
那他比我们任何人都更了解那些东西
he knows more about these things than any of us do.

650
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,700
问问她父亲在哪儿
Ask her where her father is.

651
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,330
她弟弟波格丹还不知道
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

652
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
他以为父亲只是出去求助了
He thinks he went to get help.

653
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,330
他是在外面弄屏障的时候死的
He died outside, when he was making the barrier.

654
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,700
她只能把他带回这里
She had to bring him in here.

655
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

656
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,760
-我可以吗  -嗯
- Okay? - Yeah.

657
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,060
陶瓷片
Ceramic tile.

658
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,690
问问她父亲是怎么知道
Ask her how her father knew

659
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,860
铁屑能阻挡幽魂的
about the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

660
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,500
他还知道些什么
What else did he know about them?

661
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,760
她什么都不知道
She doesn't know.

662
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
马萨罗维
"Masarov."

663
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,900
-马萨罗维是什么  -是一个地名
- What is Masarov? - It's a place.

664
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,330
上游的一个区域
It's a district up the river.

665
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
是这一切的源头
It's where it all began.

666
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,630
幽魂杀人就是从那里开始的
It's where the Aratare killings started.

667
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
幽魂
Aratare.

668
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,130
要我说就把直升机停这儿
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

669
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,930
我们从这个屋顶撤离  赶紧离开这里
Extract us from this roof and get us the hell out of here.

670
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
这里到处都是电话线和电力线
There are phone lines and power lines everywhere.

671
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,760
直升机得飞得又低又慢
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

672
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,960
一个小孩都能扛着火箭筒把它打下来
Easy pickings for a teenager with a shoulder rocket.

673
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,750
少校  现在是什么情况
Major, can you get me up to speed?

674
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,760
和基地联系过了吗
You spoke with base?

675
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,730
联系过了  将军会派直升机来接我们
Yeah. The General's sending in helos to come get us,

676
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,330
以及坦克来确保降落广场周边安全
and tanks to secure the landing zone in an open plaza

677
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,670
距这里约八百米  黎明到达
about half a mile from here, at dawn.

678
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,300
步行的话会很远
That's a long way on foot.

679
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,900
你觉得我们能带着小孩撑过八百米吗
You think we can make it a half mile? With kids?

680
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,340
我们别无选择
We don't have an option. Okay?

681
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,260
所有的路要么被封死要么埋了地雷
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

682
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,330
而且我们用信号塔和基地联系了
And since we used signal tower to talk to base,

683
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,840
所有人都知道我们的位置
everyone knows where we are.

684
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,860
我们得尽快出去
We gotta move out.

685
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:01,920
那些东西还在街上乱晃
So you wanna go running around out there

686
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,160
你想在这种情况下出去吗
with those things roaming the streets?

687
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,130
我们还没有任何看到和对付它们的办法
Even though we have no way to see or fight?

688
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,400
总比等着它们闯进来要好
Better than waiting for them to find a way in here.

689
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,900
哪里好了
How is it better?

690
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
我们没死的唯一原因就是外面的那道屏障
The only reason we're still alive is that barricade out there.

691
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,910
它们迟早会进来的
Look, eventually they're gonna get through.

692
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,230
只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

693
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,760
-先消停一下  -我们得冒险一试
- Wait, wait, wait. - We have to take our chances.

694
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,930
-这是目前最好的计划  -少校
- This is the best plan that we have. - Major.

695
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,600
如果我说我能增加成功到达广场的几率呢
What if I told you I can improve our chances of making that plaza?

696
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,660
-你说  -看看周围
- I'm listening. - Take a look around you.

697
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,860
这里到处都是这东西
Everything in this building... is filled with these.

698
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,730
铁屑
Iron dust.

699
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,600
铁能阻止那些超光谱异形
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

700
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,700
没错  把它做成武器
Exactly. Weaponize it.

701
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
-脏弹  -这是今晚最好的主意
- Dirty bombs. - Best idea I've heard all night.

702
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,360
收集手榴弹
Let's collect the grenades.

703
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,230
克莱恩
Clyne.

704
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,330
在外面我需要你做我们的眼睛
I need you to be our eyes out there.

705
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,520
你能带着摄像机走路吗
Can you haul that camera on foot?

706
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,160
我有更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

707
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,300
这个摄像机本身就能投射相符波长的紫外线
This camera already projects the right wavelength of UV light.

708
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,700
如果我能将它内部翻转过来
If I can turn it inside out,

709
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,260
通过改变一些结构的极性
by reversing the polarity of some of the components,

710
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,330
我也许能把摄像机改造成探照灯
I might be able to turn it from a camera into a searchlight.

711
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
我们凭肉眼就能看见它们
We'll be able to see them with our own eyes.

712
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,250
这能大大改善我们的境况
That'd be a game-changer.

713
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,830
我能和基地的车队通话吗
Think I can talk to the convoy?

714
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,080
我或许能告诉它们
I might be albe to tell them

715
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,260
如何对装备做同样的调整
how to do the same with their equipment.

716
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,860
他们过来时也需要能看见它们的设备
When they come get us, they're gonna need eyes, too.

717
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,760
我会帮你联系基地的主工程师
I'll connect you to the main engineer back at base.

718
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,160
收到
Copy that.

719
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,900
他们会在车上装备任何你需要的东西
They're ready to equip their vehicles with whatever you need.

720
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,800
能将需求列表复述一遍给我吗
Can you repeat the whole request back to me, please?

721
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,330
对  没错
Okay, yes. That's correct.

722
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,810
但你需要的是一个
But what you gonna need is a device

723
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,960
能发射短波长光的装置
that emits a very short wavelength of light.

724
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,230
我会详细告诉你怎么改线
I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.

725
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,000
有什么可以装在坦克上的东西吗
Do you have anything you can mount on a tank?

726
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,760
小巷那头有动静
We got movement across the alleyway.

727
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
伙计们  有动静  能看看是什么吗
Guys, we got movement. Can we get eyes on it?

728
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,200
麻烦让一下
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

729
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,620
车队那边怎么说
What's the word on the convoy?

730
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,200
上次通讯在50分钟以前
Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

731
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,000
他们在前往撤离点的路上
They're on their way to the extraction point.

732
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,000
它们来了  拿好你们的装备
Here they come! Get your gear.

733
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,160
我们15秒后离开这里
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

734
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,800
快  我们走
Okay, come on. Let's go.

735
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,660
那是去撤离点最快的路线
That was the fastest way to the extraction point.

736
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,260
她说可以带我们走另一条路
Hey. She says she can show us another way.

737
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,910
塔尔博特  你和克莱恩一起
Talbot, you're with Clyne.

738
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,130
迪亚兹  你领头

01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,700
你们要是试着回基地  就已经没命了
If you'd even tried to return to base, you'd be dead.

901
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,200
我们是这个国家最后的美军吗

我们觉得我们见鬼了
We think we're seeing things.

926
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,000
我们觉得它不是真的  但它有杀伤力
We think it can't be real, but it kills.

927
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:15,800
所以它是真的
So, it is real.

928
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
是一种物质
It's something.

929

938
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,200
意味着这东西不是天然的
It means this stuff isn't natural.

939
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
有人创造了它
Someone made it.

964
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,030
好吧  但这些东西会爬

970
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,630
我只能告诉你它们是人造的
What I can tell you... is that someone made them.

971
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,340
如果是人造的
If someone made them,

972
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,640
它们就逃不开世界的规律
they don't escape the laws of the world.

973
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,700
没有东西能逃开
Nothing does.

974
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,800
它适用于我们需要了解的新规律
It shines light on new laws, and that's what we have to learn.

975
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,680
因为它们有序有结构
Cause they have order and structure.

976
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,000
它们就可以被瓦解

982
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,650
你让我们上哪里找那种武器
Where do you expect that we can find weapons like that?

983
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,130
我们不找  我们自己造
We're not gonna find them, we're gonna build them.

984
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,920
用什么造

990
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,900
在事态进一步恶化前阻止它
and we can stop this before it goes any further.

991
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,140
因为如果我们不去

992
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,630
一路汲取所有能量的凝聚态
the condensate which feed on all the energy in its path

993
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,580

994
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
传播的范围将难以估量
There's no limit to how far they can spread,

995
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,660
除非我们阻止它们

1006
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,680
半数被贴上了"残次品"标签
Half of these are labeled "Defective."

1007
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,190
我们需要一个反向电压
We're gonna need a voltage counter.

1008
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,600
你们现在就开始测试这些东西
I want you to start testing these.

1009
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,230
好了  打开
All right, open it up.

1010
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,760
打开  掀开
Get that one open. Pop it.

1011
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,230
和我想的一样吗
Is that what I think it is?

1012
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,930
我们从基地拿来的路特斯
We got the Lotus from base.

1013
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000

1014
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,130
-像一只机械罗特韦尔犬  -看啊
- Looks like a mechanical rottweiler. - Look at that.

1015
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,060
克莱恩做了些调整

他们在卸下链式起重机  装上探照灯
They're taking down a chain hoist and putting up a searchlight.

1017
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,960
似曾相识嘛
Déjà vu.

1018
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,000
-它发射什么  -一种聚焦能量脉冲
- What does it fire? - It's a focused energy pulse.

1019
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,030
如果我没算错的话
If my math is right...

1020
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,960
它应该可以瓦解凝聚态
it should break down condensate.

1021
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,570
马萨罗维
Masarov.

1022
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,030

The single largest power plant in the region.

1023
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,250
也是死亡的发源地
It's where the killings started.

1024
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,200
如果它们是人造的  那一定就是在这里
If they're man-made, they were made here.

1025
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,060
距离这里不到十公里
It's less than ten klicks from here.

1026
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:47,360
飞机可以到达  但可能只有一条路
Our birds can make that, but... it's probably one way.

1027
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,150
我一直在当地居民那里挖掘线索
I've been digging for clues with the civilians here.

1028
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,830
我找到了关于马萨罗维的情报
I found this intel on Masarov.

1029
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,160
在过去十年间  它被中央政权
It's been retrofitted several times over the last decade

1030
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,660
翻新过很多次
by the central regime.

1031
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,280
表面写满了"武器研究"的字样
It's got "Weapons research" written all over it.

1032
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,020
好的  你和克莱恩需要潜进去
Okay, you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate.

1033
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,680
就指望你们弄清楚怎么停止这一切了
It's gonna be up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this.

1034
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
我们得声东击西
We have to create a diversion.

1035
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,710
我们会在这里吸引它们好让你们潜入内部
We'll draw them out here so you can infiltrate the structure

1036
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,000
试着找到源头
and try to find the source.

1037
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,110
克莱恩说这些武器会释放高温电流
Clyne's predicting the charge from these weapons will be extremely hot.

1038
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,960
足够摧毁凝聚态
Enough to destroy condensate.

1039

好了  兄弟们
All right, boys.

1041
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,730
就这样了
This is it.

1042
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,760
如果还有什么遗言
If you have any last words...

1043

现在说吧
now's the time.

1044
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,230
好  听好了
All right, listen up.

1045
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,120
你们用的是未经测试的武器
You are using untested weapons...

1046
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,860
抵抗此刻看来是无法被击退的敌人
against an enemy that, to this point, has been unstoppable.

1047
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,620
现在你们要前往未知的领地
Now, you are heading into unknown territory.

1048

听清楚了
And hear me when I say

1049
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,300
你们会看到一些无法理解的东西
you're gonna see things you will not understand.

1050
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,940
我们的敌人已在数日之内遍布全城
Our enemy has spread through the city in a matter of days.

1051
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,820
不知道它们会传播多远
There's no telling how far they will spread...

1052
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,680
除非我们反击
unless we fight back.

1053
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:34,160
很多人都不曾有机会改变未来
Most men never even come close... to changing the future.

1054
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,360
此地
This is the place.

1055
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,030
此刻
And now is the time.

1056
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,900
毫无疑问  你们是最后一道防线
Make no mistake, you're the last line of defense.

1057
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,830
让我们完成最初的使命

1103
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,730
塞申斯  我们被分开了
Sessions, we got split up.

1104
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,820
还在寻找实验室
We're still looking for the lab.

1105
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,600
我们还在撑着  不知道能撑多久
We're holding. Don't know how long.

01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,830
-收到了吗  -能听到吗  塞申斯
- Do you copy? - Can you hear me? Sessions?

1107
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260

肯定很近了
We gotta be close now.

1109
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,060
天哪
God.

1110
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,900
看这里
Look over here.

1111
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,660
波色-爱因斯坦凝聚态
Bose-Einstein condensate.

1112
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,200
看那些X光线
Look at these x-rays.

1113
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,330
他们在扫描人类  而且是分子级别的
They were scanning people. On a molecular level.

1114
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,800
然后用凝聚态打印出来
And printing them out of condensate.

1115
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,030
这是条装配线
It's an assembly line.

1116
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,260
就像某种...
Like some kind of...

1117
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,000
工业生产线
Industrial process.

1118
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,760
没错
You're right.

1119
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,800
这就是个武器
It's a weapon.

1120
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,130
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

1121
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:22,100
看起来像是出现了灾难性故障
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

1122
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,630
一半单元格破损而且已经空了
Half the cells are broken and empty.

1123
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,060
肯定是结构损坏让它们逃了出来
Some structural failure must have set them free.

1124
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,600
打开了潘多拉魔盒
Opened up pandora's box.

1125
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,730
现在怎么办
Now what?

1126
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
敌人出现

12点钟方向

1129
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
-要来了  -瞄准目标

1130
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,760
-有一个重新聚合了  -干掉它
- One of them is reforming. - Bring it down!

1131
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,130
中央政府高端研究顾问
"Top research advisers of the central regime."

1132
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,360
他想要阻止这个局面的  确实是失控了
This man was trying to stop it. They did lose control.

1133
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,630
你能翻译这个吗
Can you translate this?

1134
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,010
是紧急关闭程序
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.

1135
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,630
上面一半的字我都没见过
Half these words I've never seen.

1136
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,860
另一半写的什么
What about the other half?

1137
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,000
解耦  解耦程序
"Decouple... decouple procedure.

1138
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,220
断开脐带链接
Disconnect the umbilicals to,

1139
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,200
以中断神经活动
uh... interrupt the... neural activity."

1140
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,660
-好的  -所以你得解锁所有端口
- Okay. - So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

1141
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,120
然后拉这个
And then you gotta pull

1142
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,200
操纵杆  断开所有电缆
this bracket here to release all the cables.

1143
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,000
然后呢
And then?

1144
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,900
应该就能阻止它们了
That should stop them.

1145
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,260
拿着
Take this.

1146
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,330
快点  给我起来
Come on! Get up!

1147
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,200
在那里  又增加了
Right there! There's more!

1148
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,600
又出现一个
Another one!

1149
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,300
就在那
Got it right there!

1150
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,730
-克莱恩  -我知道
- Clyne! - I know!

1151
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,660
搞什么
What the hell?

1152
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,200
我都断开了  没有用啊
I did them all. Nothing's happening.

1153
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:02,900
克莱恩  拉操纵杆  中间那个
Clyne! Pull the bracket! In the middle!

1154
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,930
-不  -不
- No! - No!

1155
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:46,060
-结束了吗  -不知道
- Is it over? - I don't know.

1156
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,300
你还能走路吗
Can you walk?

1157
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,630
-我没事  -来吧
- I'm all right. - Come on.

1158
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,700
我们得找条出路
We have to find a way out.

1159
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,330
-听到了吗  -听到了
- Do you hear that? - Yeah.

1160
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
是这里了
This is it.

1161
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,600
他们不只是扫描人类
They weren't just scanning people.

1162
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,030
它们也不仅仅是打印物
They're not just printouts.

1163
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,900
这是控制他们的东西
This is what's controlling them.

1164
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,330
这些是真正的尸体
These are from real corpses.

1165
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,630
每一个都是一条生命
Each one is made from a real person.

1166
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,700
他们都还活着吗
They're alive?

1167
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:19,830
并非活着
They're not alive.

1168
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
但也没有死亡
They're not dead.

1169
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,700
他们被困在了生死之间
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

1170
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,360
但是十分痛苦
But they are in pain.

1171
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1172
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,630
这就是痛苦
This is pain.

1173
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,260
那你怎么知道他们能感觉到
But how do you know they can feel?

1174
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:46,860
我无法证明
I can't prove it.

1175
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,700
确实
I can't.

1176
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,030
也许科学确实无法回答一切问题
So, maybe there are things science can't answer.

1177
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,630
不
No.

1178
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,100
等等  不要
Wait, no.

1179
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,160
这是我们来这里的目的
This is why we came here.

1180
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,100
这都是证据  是你来的目的  记得吗
This is the evidence. This is why you came, remember?

1181
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,830
记得吗  已经死了那么多人  你说的
Remember? So many people have died. You said it.

1182
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,230
-你说你要知道原因  -已经够了
- You said, "I wanna know why." - I know enough.

1183
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,960
你得为大局考虑
You have to think about the bigger picture.

1184
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:35,900
这就是为大局
I am.

1185
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,700
帮他们依次下机
Help them off single file.

1186
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:33,940
后续还有更多伤员
Got more coming in!

1187
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:36,230
送他们去第五小队
Put them in unit 5.

1188
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,320
-这边这边  -小心他的脖子
- Over here. Over here. - Watch his neck.

1189
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,200
我没事
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1190
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,670
把手给我
