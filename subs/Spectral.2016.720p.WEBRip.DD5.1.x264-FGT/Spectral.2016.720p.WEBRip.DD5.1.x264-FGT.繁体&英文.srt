00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,800
但貌似我們并沒有庫存
but apparently, we don't store it.

53
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,260
那東西都過時了  而且還貴得要命
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

54
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,030
只是后來貴了  九十年代的時候很便宜
It got expensive. Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

55
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,160
所以如果認真找找的話...
So, if you look hard enough...

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,960
還是能找到些的
You can still find some lying around.

57
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,300
你找街頭匪幫要到了并四苯嗎
You find a street gang that slings tetracene?

你要和上頭說
You gonna tell the suits

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,930
你在用二十年前的零部件運行它嗎
you're running this on a 20-year-old part, right?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,130
我會證明其可行  然后和他們說
I'll show them it works and I'm gonna tell them:

64
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,010
"這就是原型機與
"That's the difference between

65
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,830
量產型號的區別

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
好了
Okay.

你來啟動吧
I'll let you call it.

72
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,900
如果將其應用于其他材料
If you think about the applications on other materials,

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,930
效果會相當明顯
it could be fairly significant.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,360
比如說  金屬制品
Metals, for instance,

75
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,030
受微小的力或噪音干擾就會被粉碎
can be shattered with very little effort or noise.

76
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,760
混凝土  橡膠...
Concrete, rubber...

77
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,000
在巨大的溫差下也會異常脆弱
they're all vulnerable to violent temperature changes.

78
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,760
這個項目是應海豹突擊六隊之需而啟動的
Yeah, this project started as a request from Seal Team 6.

79
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,200
自盧旺達的圍城以后
After the siege in Rwanda,

80
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,330
他們就來問我們能否
they came to us asking for the capability to

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,630
瞬間凍結或汽化敵人的水源
flash freeze or boil the enemy's water supply.

82
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,200
如今這個裝置可以將敵人們趕出來了
Now, this device could have driven the enemy out.

83
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,150
你有在活體上測試過嗎
And you... tried this on living things?

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,660
這不是我們的初衷
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

85
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,180
希望你們能測試一下
We'd like you test it.

86
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,360
有自愿的嗎
Any volunteers?

87
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,000
我們會試試的
Well... we'll give it a try.

Gentlemen, why don't we go have a sit down?

89
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,800
我們談談下一步安排  好嗎
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

90
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,830
這邊走
Yeah. Right this way.

91
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,030
你是想良心無愧嗎
What do you want, a clean conscience?

92
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,660
就算用塊牛肉來測試它  我也不在乎
Test it with a slab of beef for all I care.

93
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,830
我只希望不要背離了我們的設計初衷
What I want is to use it for what we originally designed it as.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
用于震懾
A deterrent.

95
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,450
沒人說過要用來微波加熱別人的肺
Nobody said anything about microwaving people's lungs.

96
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,330
這是戰爭
It's war.

97
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,960
是我們賴以為生的產業
It's the business we're in.

98
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,360
你記得當初雇用我時說的套話嗎
Remember what you sold it to me as when you hired me?

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,730
致力于防御
Defense.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
還是有部分屬實的
And that's still partially true.

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,800
但戰爭是樁好生意
But war is good business.

102
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,300

So is human trafficking.

"I don't know what weapons we'll use to fight in World War III,

- He worked for the government. - That's right.

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,980
如果你去問他
And if you ask him, I don't think

110
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,730
我想他不會覺得那是他最輝煌的時刻
he thought that was his finest hour.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
他肯定也會對把活人瞬間燒糊有意見的
I'm sure he has feelings about flash-boiling human flesh.

112
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,800
想過要研究有全感知反饋的義肢嗎
Ever think about prosthetic limbs with full sensory feedback?

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,780

That is the empathetic scientist in you dying.

116

你和伙計們說了怎么操控射線了嗎
Did you brief your guys on how to operate the ray?

-說了  -很好
- I did. - Good.

那你可以開始收拾行李了
Then you can start packing.

是關于這些護目鏡的

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,200
俄羅斯曾統治摩爾多瓦  后又失去控制
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

155
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,660
國家獨立了  但內部紛爭不斷
It became independent, but it's struggling internally.

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
一方面  是叛軍作亂
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

157
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,700
全都是政府的前精銳部隊
made up of the regime's former elite soldiers.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,780
他們全都訓練有素且極度危險
They're well-trained and dangerous.

159
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
另一方面  這里的大部分國民
On the other, you have most of the population,

160
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
都想推翻政府的統治
who are tearing down the regime's flags

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
渴望新政府
and demanding a new government.

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,790
不管有多復雜
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,

163
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,960
內亂是我們所熟悉的事情
is a business we're familiar with.

164
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,700
我們覺得自己擅長處理內亂
We like to think we're good at it.

165
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,730
但是你的攝像機發現的這個...
But this thing your camera found...

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,300
是種全新的玩意兒
It's a whole new piece of business.

167
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,340
我沒法把這個視頻交給美軍歐洲司令部
I can't send this video to EUCOM.

168
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,230
我只是擔心他們會認為這是個玩笑
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
國防部沒有幽默感
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,030
通常沒有  幫我們裝好
Typically not. Hook us up.

171
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,960
我相信這些東西有科學的解釋
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation for what's on these,

172
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,030
但是在你告訴我之前
but until you tell me,

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
我是不會把它上交指揮系統的
I'm not sending it up the chain of command.

174
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,130
-搞定了  -是的  長官
- You done? - Yes, sir.

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
-出去把我們鎖好  在外面等著  -是
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside. - Sir.

176
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
這里沒有人對這個有任何頭緒
Nobody here has been able to make heads or tails of this.

177
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,160
由于一些我無法隨意告知你的原因
It's thrown a wrench into our entire operation

178
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,830
我們的整個行動都被攪亂了
for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss with you.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,730
我只能告訴你我們急需解釋
I can tell you we need answers fast.

180
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
-介意我來嗎  -你這么快就看到了
- Do you mind? - You spotted that quick.

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,900
五個頭盔攝像機
Five different helmet cams

182
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,360
在過去三周內拍到了相似的東西
picked up something similar in the last three weeks.

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,170
最初情報技術人員
At first, our signals

184
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
認為那是干擾信號
intelligence tech wrote it off as interference.

185
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,330
那可不是干擾信號
That's not interference.

186
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
我覺得要是干擾信號的話
I don't think you'd fly me all the way here

187
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,660
不會讓我大老遠飛到這里來
for interference.

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,130
想跟我說說你的想法嗎
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
我想讓你先說出你的想法
I want you to tell me what you're thinking.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
我...暫時沒什么想法
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,630
但這總是有解釋的
But there is an explanation.

192
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,730
這是第一次觀測到的畫面  另外三次類似
That was the first sighting. Three others just like it.

193
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,180
最后一次有些不同
The last was different.

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,130
因為牽扯到一位三角洲部隊成員
It involved a member of Delta Force,

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,960
這讓事情變得極其敏感
that makes it particularly sensitive.

196
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,100
這位是中情局的弗蘭·麥迪遜
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

197
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,700
這里的特別行動都是中情局的秘密任務
What special ops does here is done under CIA covert operations.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
在我們繼續之前你得把這個簽了
You need to sign this before we go any further.

199
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,330
-這是什么  -敏感信息保證書
- What is this? - It's an SCI oath.

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,090
如果你泄露了
You're acknowledging it's life

201
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,330
告訴你的任何事  你將被判終身監禁
in prison if you reveal anything you're told.

202
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,130
{\an8}{\pos(317,232)}敏感信息隔離設施

203
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,700
-找到戴維斯的文件  -是  長官
- Cue up the Davis file, please. - Yes, ma'am.

204
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
三天前我們中城區進行了一次突擊行動
Three days ago we conducted a raid in mid-city.

205
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,390
我們的通訊時斷時續
Our communications were intermittent,

206
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,260
有一位隊員與隊伍失聯了
and a guy got separated from the group...

207
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
最終他在行動中被殺
Where he ended up killed in action.

208
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,300
他比任何人離得都近
He got closer than anybody.

209
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
太近了
Too close.

210
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
這里是D組1隊  你們看到了嗎
Dagger team 1, you seeing this?

211
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,630
這里有東西在干擾信號
There's some kind of disturbance here.

212
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,630
戴維斯  什么東西  你看到什么了
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

213
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,000
見鬼
What the hell?

214
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,930
克里斯·戴維斯中士
Sergeant Chris Davis.

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,260
經歷過三次戰爭的老兵  精英中的精英
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

216
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,800
最近幾周我們在全城范圍內都發現了
In the last few weeks we've been finding bodies around the city

217
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
死法相同的尸體
that were killed in the same way.

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
尸檢無法得出結論
The autopsies defied all explanation.

219
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,730
他們的內臟被冰凍住
Their internal organs were frozen

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,830
然而皮膚卻被燒灼和腐蝕了
and yet, their skin was burned and corroded.

221
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
從摩爾多瓦友軍方面
The only response from the allied

222
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,660
得到的唯一回應  只有震驚和困惑
Moldovan military contact is shock, confusion.

223
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,930
還有憤怒
And there's anger.

224
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,690
有一些少年
There's teenagers

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,330
在出事地點噴涂"滅絕幽魂"的記號
spray-painting "Genocide Aratare" at kill sites.

226
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,730
-滅絕什么  -"幽魂"
- Genocide...? - "Aratare."

227
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,330
當地的傳說  戰爭的鬼魂
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,300
"如同噩夢一般"  大概是這個意思
"As nightmarish as." That's the literal translation.

229
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,160
-還很有詩意  -那是他們的迷信
- That's very poetic. - Well, they're superstitious.

230
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,030
他們不知怎地認為...
They somehow think...

231
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,760
戰爭的恐怖喚醒了一些非自然的力量
the horrors of the war have kicked up something unnatural.

232
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,360
-我們希望你能給出別的理論  -你怎么看
- We hope you have an alternate theory. - What do you think?

233
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,390
我認為你們得給它們起個新名字
Think you need a new name for them.

234
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,900
除了這個
Beyond that.

235
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,290
給我一份這些數據的拷貝  給我點時間
Give me a copy of the data, some time...

236
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,700
不可能
That's not possible.

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,800
你們想讓我現在就搞清楚
You want me to figure this out right now?

238
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,100
-我們需要你的看法  -我還沒什么看法
- We want your assessment. - I don't have one yet.

239
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,490
那么  我們就得把目前的理論
Then, I think we have to send our working theory

240
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,600
上交給指揮系統
up the chain of command.

241
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,710
我不想這樣做
I don't wanna do that.

242
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,230
好吧  目前的理論是什么
Okay. What is your working theory?

243
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,660
我們認為這是一種隱身技術
The agency thinks this is some kind of cloaking technology.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,230
叛軍士兵穿著動態偽裝服
Insurgent soldiers wearing active camouflage.

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,230
在這個國家嗎  那么先進的技術
In this country? Something that advanced?

246
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,710
中情局知道歐洲和亞洲的
CIA knows a few groups in Europe

247
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,800
一些組織可能在研究動態偽裝服
and Asia could be working on active camouflage.

248
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,230
國防部高級研究計劃局也在研究隱形技術
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,000
我們離原型都還差好多年
We're years away from a prototype.

250
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
也許有人領先了你們
Maybe somebody beat you to it.

251
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,330
我們已經是這個領域最先進的了
DARPA is the leader in the field.

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
你確定嗎
Are you certain of that?

253
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,800
地方政府斥巨資進行武器研究
The regime spent heavily on weapons research.

254
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
腐敗  松散的法治
Corruption, loose legislation.

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,260
對一個想要低調的軍事實驗室來說
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

256
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,830
-這里是悄悄進行研究的完美地點  -好吧
- This is a great place to work and hide. - Okay.

257
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,260
我們假設這是一種隱身技術
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,680
怎么解釋死因
How do you account for cause of death?

259
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,260
對受害者的沖擊波
A shock delivered to the victim.

260
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
我覺得你只是瞎猜的
I think you're reaching.

261
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,660
我們的工作需要進行推測
Our business requires us to make suppositions.

262
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,600
而我的工作需要去證實這些推測
My business requires us to prove them.

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
你們的技術人員的工作是找到故障
Your technician's job is to find glitches,

264
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,760
所以他們看到了故障
so, he sees glitches.

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,210
你們的工作是找到敵人
Your job is to find the enemy,

266
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,300
所以你們看到了敵人
so, you see the enemy.

267
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,360
本地人相信鬼魂  他們就看到了鬼魂
Locals believe in spirits, so they see spirits.

268
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,030
在某一方面  每個人都有自己的偏見
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

269
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,390
所以  現在我的回答是
So, my answer to you right

270
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,660
我們目前缺少數據來支持任何理論
now is that we lack data to support any theory.

271
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
好吧
Okay.

272
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,930
你需要什么來得出更肯定的結論
What do you need to make a more definitive statement?

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,300
首先  你們得有更好的畫面
First, you need a better shot.

274
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,630
這正是我想要的  更好的畫面
That's what I'm looking for, a better shot.

275
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,260
怎么做
How?

276
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,230
-這邊  長官  -就是這個
- Right here, sir. - That's it.

277
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,230
我從DARPA帶來了這個  超光譜攝像機
I brought this from DARPA. A hyperspectral camera.

278
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,260
比你們用的頭盔攝像機更強大的設備
A more powerful version of the helmet cams your guys are using.

279
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
它能看到深層次的光譜
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,740
不管是否可見  只要有東西
Visible or invisible, if something's there,

281
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,600
它就能觀察到
this'll pick it up.

282
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,260
你能把這東西安在三角洲部隊的戰車上嗎
Can you mount this thing... on a delta vehicle?

283
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,300
-當然可以  -很好
- I don't see why not. - All right, good.

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
我們每天在城里都有行動
We run missions into the city every day.

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,630
我把戰地技術人員找來  你教他怎么操作
I'll put you with our field tech, tell him how to operate it.

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,160
我不想讓我之外的第二個人來操作這部攝像機
I wouldn't put a tech in between this camera and myself.

287
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,060
那你想親自操作
So, you wanna operate it?

288
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,370
要想拍到關鍵畫面...
If you want that kill shot...

289
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,600
需要快速的臨場反應
you'll need a fast reaction time out there.

290
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,700
下次行動  你跟三角洲部隊一起
Next mission, you ride with delta.

291
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,610
他們會帶你接近那東西
They're gonna get you close to this thing.

292
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,100
等你給我搞到關鍵畫面
You get me the kill shot...

293
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,060
你就可以直接拎包回弗吉尼亞
you can go home to Virginia without unpacking.

294
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,630
有個轉子壞了  你得把它換掉
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

295
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
把它焊在前面板上
Weld it onto the front panel.

296
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,200
瞧瞧這個
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

297
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,200
-這家伙在做什么  -我不知道
- What's this guy up to, man? - I don't know.

298
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,600
你相信這家伙嗎
Believe this guy?

299
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,330
-如果有作用的話  -說真的
- If it works. - For real.

300
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,130
聽說你要在我們的車上裝個攝像機
Heard you're installing a camera on our truck.

301
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
要是你不把50口徑機槍拆下來我本來沒意見
Which was fine until you ripped out that 50 Cal.

302
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
你拆了把槍換了部攝像機上去
You're taking down a gun to put up a camera?

303
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,200
只有那里有空間放置攝像機
It's the only place large enough to mount it.

304
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,130
你們能明白吧  我知道這聽起來像個壞主意
You guys get that, right? I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

305
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,110
我們更喜歡跟帶我們的人合作
We prefer to dance with who brung us...

306
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,930
克萊恩博士  懂了嗎
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,230
"跟帶你們的人合作"  我并不懂
"Dance with who brung you"? No, actually, I don't.

308
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
這輛車救過我們的命很多次
This truck has saved our lives, many times.

309
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
我明白
I understand.

310
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
你們知道這輛車是克萊恩博士的團隊制造的嗎
You guys know Dr. Clyne's team built that truck?

311
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,700
克萊恩博士在DARPA工作
Clyne works over at DARPA.

312
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,170
我跟他的團隊緊密合作過
I've worked closely with his group.

313
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,200
去過他們在弗吉尼亞的設施
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

314
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,400
很高興見到你  克萊恩博士
Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.

315
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,660
我也是  卡布瑞拉上尉
Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

316
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,960
他們給這些車改裝了更堅固輕便的裝甲
They retrofitted these trucks with tougher, lighter weight armor.

317
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,960
他們設計了裝載機來搬運重物
They designed the mechanical loaders that do the heavy lifting,

318
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,200
給你們省了力氣
so you boys don't strain yourselves too hard.

319
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,330
事實上  克萊恩博士本人
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,660
還設計了輕薄的凱夫拉連體緊身衣
developed the thin weight Kevlar body stocking that literally...

321
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
來保護你們的蛋蛋
protects your balls.

322
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,390
我希望你們
So, I would think there'd be

323
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,000
都能對克萊恩博士心存感激
nothing but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

324
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,200
-塞申斯少校  -上尉  讓你的人退下
- Major Sessions. - Captain, have your men fall back.

325
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,360
-都散開  -把它放下
- Get back to it. - Get it done.

326
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,330
少校  這位是克萊恩博士
Major, this is Dr. Clyne.

327
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,300
在過去五年他和我們合作過多次
He's worked with us eight or ten times over the last five years.

328
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,060
你要和突擊隊一起去擊殺鬼影嗎
You go out with the assault team on hunting ghost?

329
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
不  長官
No, sir.

330
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,760
他是個好人  少校
He's a good man, major.

331
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,100
很好  但我不喜歡帶游客執行作戰任務
That's great. I'm just not a fan of taking tourists on combat missions.

332
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,600
長官  我不是游客
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

333
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,230
如果沒攜帶突擊步槍  那你就是個游客
If you're not carrying an M4, you're a tourist.

334
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
如果你堅持  我可以配槍
I can carry one, if you'd like.

335
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,600
少校  我們得把克萊恩博士帶去戰場
Major, we gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

336
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,900
這樣他才能追蹤目標  幫助我們擊斃它
so he can track the target force and get us a kill shot.

337
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
這個儀器需要多久才能運轉
How long before this equipment's operational?

338
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
幾個小時吧
A few hours.

339
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,700
-會有用嗎  -如果我們離得夠近
- Is it gonna work? - If we get close enough.

340
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
戴維斯中士...就離得夠近了
Let me tell you something. Sergeant Davis...he got close enough.

341
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,730
他是我們最頂尖的三角洲隊員
That's the best delta that we had.

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,100
最好保證你的儀器也是最頂尖的
Make sure your equipment is top-notch this time.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,060
-他們情同手足  -我理解
- They were like brothers. - I get it.

344
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
好吧
Okay.

345
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,030
晚上好  博士
Evening, doc.

346
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,860
聽說你倆一見如故
Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

347
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,760
-她可以放松一點  -你也是
- She can come off a bit intense. - Yeah. So can you.

348
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
我來這兒只是幫你們找到這東西
I'm just here to find this thing.

349
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
為了找到它  你都愿意參與作戰任務
You're willing to go on a combat mission to find it.

350
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,830
她也是
She is, too.

351
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,160
華盛頓給她施加了太大的壓力
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

352
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,830
他們想要答案  而她負責找出答案
They want an answer and it's her job to give them one.

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
在任務名單上看到了你們的名字
Saw your names on a mission roster.

354
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,860
我知道這是最緊要的事
I knew this was a top priority...

355
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,000
但他們把你們倆都派來...
but for them to embed you both...

356
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,100
不用擔心我
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,930
我不擔心你  博士  我擔心這東西
I'm not worried about you, doc. I'm worried about it.

358
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,060
她認為這是一種隱形技術
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

359
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,860
你覺得呢
What do you think it is?

360
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,360
我們都還沒想到的某種東西
Something no one's thought of yet.

361
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,330
各位  昨天18點
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

362
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,330
U組去杜勒斯地執行偵察任務時
Utah team left here on a recon mission to Durlesti,

363
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
與叛軍交火了
when they were engaged by insurgents.

364
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,230
我們設法弄清交火時他們說了什么
We managed to hear most of their chatter during the firefight,

365
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
但結果并不理想
but comes were unreliable.

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,900
目標是這里的一棟五層建筑
Target is a five-story apartment building here.

367
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,030
我們認為活著的U組隊員被關押在四樓
We think what's left of utah team is being held on the fourth floor,

368
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,860
位于西北角的房間里
in the northwest corner apartment.

369
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,260
我們將深入叛軍占領區域
We're gonna be knee-deep in an insurgent-held area in the city.

370
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,330
所以  做好交戰準備
So, we should expect a fight.

371
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,130
最后一件事
One last thing.

372
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,070
我們的人被抓住之前
Before our guys were grabbed,

373
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,600
通過無線電匯報了看到的東西
they radioed in that they saw

374
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
我們稱之為  超光譜異形物
what we're now calling hyperspectral anomalies.

375
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,010
此次任務要速戰速決
Your mission is a quick extraction.

376
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,700
找到U組隊員  帶他們出來
You get our guys and you get out.

377
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,160
如果交火  將異形物就地消滅
However, if engaged, neutralize the anomalies in the area.

378
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
消滅他們
Neutralize them?

379
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,200
-怎么消滅  -我們要對付的是什么
- How? - Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

380
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,830
我們認為是穿著先進電子偽裝服的敵方士兵
We believe these are enemy soldiers in advanced electronic camouflage.

381
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,190
所以  交火時務必小心  如果他們...
So, be surgical when you fire. If they are...

382
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,740
如果不清楚他們是什么  也許我們該...
If we don't really know what they are, maybe we should...

383
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,860
不好意思  你想補充什么嗎
Excuse me? Would you like to add something?

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
如果他們穿戴了隱形技術
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

385
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,730
你們要盡可能將其完好無損地帶回來
you need to bring it back as intact as possible.

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
克萊恩博士和麥迪遜特工會和你們一起去
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison will be on mission with you.

387
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,760
克萊恩博士會在車隊中第二輛反伏擊車上
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring your helmet-cam feeds

388
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,800
監測你們頭盔攝像機的反饋影像
from the second MRAP vehicle in the convoy.

389
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
塞申斯少校會帶領D組1隊進行營救
Major Sessions will lead dagger team 1 to do the extraction.

390
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,800
拿好裝備  隨時待命
Stay on come. Get your gear.

391
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,820
走吧  伙計
Partner, let's go.

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,230
AJ  檢查前部和中部
AJ, front and center.

393
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
檢查武器  比利
Weapons check, Billy.

394
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,860
沒問題
You got it.

395
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,160
這路對你來說不夠平坦嗎
Our ride not smooth enough for you?

396
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,000
你還敢說自己很厲害[屁股堅硬]And you call yourself hard-ass.

397
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,330
他們真應該重新鋪一下這條路  兄弟
They really need to repave these roads, man.

398
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,130
好了  伙計們  我們正在進入廢棄區
All right, guys, we're coming into the abandoned zone.

399
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,630
做好面對大批叛軍的準備吧
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

400
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
慢點
Okay.

401
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,340
我發現了一具叛軍的尸體
I've got an insurgent body here.

402
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,100
我發現了U組的高皮  確認陣亡
I got Agopia from Utah team. Confirmed KIA.

403
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,780
他們都沒有交火的跡象
None of these guys appear to have taken any rounds.

404
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,100
沒有明顯外傷
No entry or exit wounds.

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,160
阿萊西奧匯報  向五樓移動中

-沒錯  就在那兒  -你就在它上方
- That's it. Right there. - You're right on top of it.

409
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,660
有活動跡象  浴缸下有東西
It's a motion signature. There's something under that tub.

410
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,930
路易斯  浴缸  把浴缸翻過來
Lewis, the tub. I want you to flip over the tub.

411
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,360
-托爾  你負責查看下面是什么  -好的
- Toll, I want you on what's underneath. - I'm on it.

412

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
-你們組的其他人呢  -他們在樓上
- Where's the rest of your team? - They're upstairs.

417
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,800
但他們都死了  鉆到皮膚下面了  
But they're all gone. Got under their skin.

418
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,930

像一條冰凍的毛毯
Like a frozen blanket.

421
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,130
-U組的其他人呢  -他們死了
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah? - Oh, they're dead.

422
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,630
他們都死了
Yeah, they're all dead.

423
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,330
我們都死了
We're all dead.

424
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,100
-尸體在哪  -我說了  在頂樓
- Where are the bodies? - I told you, they're on the top floor.

425
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
你還沒見過它吧
Oh, you haven't seen it.

426
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
我見過了  你知道我信仰上帝  約翰
I've seen it. You know I believe in God, John.

427
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,730
它是上帝的對立面
This is the opposite of god.

428
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,860
等等  這是誰  能讓他轉個身嗎
Wait wait wait. Who's this right there? Can you tell him to turn back?

429
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,040
麥克法登  轉過身去
McFadden, turn back.

430
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,260
讓我們看看那個房間
Give us a view of that room.

431
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,170
什么也沒有  我就站在這兒呢
Nothing's there, guys. I'm standing right here.

432
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,950
麥克  我們正看著它呢
Mac, we're both staring right at it.

433
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
就在你視線中央
It's in the middle of your view port.

434
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,600
什么  那個嗎  只是個污點而已
What? That? It's a smear.

435
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,860
大概是這破護目鏡的問題

我們需要空運  但我聯系不上基地

524
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,100
繼續嘗試

長官  我一直在發信號但他們收不到

546
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,600
她嚇得不輕  照看好她
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

547
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,700
呼叫基地  這里是D組1隊  收到請回答
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger team 1. Do you copy? Over.

548
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,830

我是陳中士  我是U組的

553
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,830
我只能告訴你
Well, I can tell you this much.

554
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,160
科姆斯托克中士今年收不到圣誕賀卡了

-你在哪躲著呢  -我是通訊兵

-我沒見到動態偽裝兵  -動態偽裝兵
- I never saw the active camouflage. - Active camouflage?

560
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,230
根本就沒有這樣的士兵  就算有
Even if there was a such thing, and there's not...

561
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,760
人類怎么可能穿著動態偽裝服穿過墻壁呢
How does a human wearing active camouflage walk through walls?

562
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,260
或被三個彈夾的穿甲彈打穿都沒死
Or through three mags of armor-piercing ammo?

563
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,730
我看到帕特對其中一個打了至少150發
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

564
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,060
這東西至少殺了19個我們的人

565
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,600
而我們還不知道它是什么東西
And we have no idea what it is.

566
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
克萊恩
Clyne.

567
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
你見過它
You saw it.

568
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,730
它是什么東西
What was it?

569
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,230
是人類
Human.

570
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,930
有著人類的外形
Had a human form.

571
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,160
它看著我  有自己的意識
It looked at me, it was conscious.

572
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,230
就像個活人
Like a person.

573
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,760
有什么能解釋你看到的東西嗎
Is there anything that explains what you saw?

574
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,030
沒有
No.

575
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
我們把能用的護目鏡收集起來
Let's pull together all the functional goggles that we have.

576
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,140
我的護目鏡在撞擊中壞了
My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.

577
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,160
我的也是  撞壞了
Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

578
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,730
別管護目鏡了  反正我們也沒辦法充電
Forget the goggles. We can't recharge them anyway.

579
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,360
那我們怎么辦
So, what do we do?

580
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
我們怎么發現它們
How are we supposed to see them?

581
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,930
也許那臺攝像機還能幫上忙
Maybe that camera can still help us.

582
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,180
如果能占領制高點
If we get to an elevated position,

583
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,730
情況可能對我們更有利
we'd have a better vantage point.

584
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
來搭把手
Help me with this?

585
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
我們走  行動起來
Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,630
到處都是
They're everywhere.

587
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,030
有什么東西阻擋住了它們
Something's stopping them.

588
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,930
某種黑色沙土
Some sort of black sand.

589
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,330
我在那沙里摔了一跤
I fell in that sand.

590
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,930
-我把它從手里摳出來了  -讓我看看
- I had to... pick it out of my hand. - Let me see it.

591
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,700
-一小片尖銳金屬  -是鐵屑
- Little, sharp pieces of metal. - They're iron filings.

592
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,630
-純鐵  -是啊
- It's pure iron. - Yeah.

593
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,660
一整條鐵屑  圍繞房子一圈
And there's a trail of it... All the way around the building.

594
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,360
這是一道屏障  有人把它放在那的
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

595
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,860
看來這里還有人
I don't think we're alone.

596
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,230
整理好裝備  我們清理樓上
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

597
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
瞄準就開槍
Point and shoot?

598
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,760
瞄準就開槍
Point and shoot.

599
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,330
突進  突進
Breach! Breach!

600
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,700
-發現兒童  -安全
- I've got kids. - Clear.

601
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,030
-安全  -解除警報
- Clear. - All clear.

602
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
派人守住長墻那里
Tell them to take the long wall.

603
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,760
問他們槍從哪來的  這里還有誰
Ask them where they got this, and who else is here.

604
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,480
問問他們工廠里
Ask them if there's anyone

605
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,730
是否還有其他人  以及他們是否有槍
else in the factory, and do they have guns.

606
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,200
她說只有她們倆在這里
She says they're here alone.

607
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,900
就那一把槍  沒有士兵
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

608
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
-一個人都沒有  -塞申斯少校
- No one at all. - Major sessions.

609
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,930
出什么問題了
What's the problem?

610
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,700
這工廠有自己的信號塔
This factory has its own transmission tower.

611
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,130
能發出很強的信號
It puts out a huge signal.

612
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,030
有什么問題嗎
So, what's the problem?

613
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,600
32公里內的所有人
Everyone within 20 miles

614
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,200
都能聽見我們和基地的通話
will hear our conversation with base.

615
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,300
任何叛軍的電臺都能截獲我們的信號
Any insurgent radio will pick up our transmission.

616
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,700
現在最不用擔心的就是叛軍
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

617
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,960
盡快和奧倫德將軍取得聯系
Connect me to General Orland as soon as possible.

618
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,490
呼叫基地  這里是D組

619
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,630
能收到嗎

呼叫基地  這里是D組

622
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,490
呼叫基地  這里是D組
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2, this is dagger team.

623
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,630
能收到嗎
Do you copy?

624
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,180
你們是我們的新兵
You guys are our new recruits.

625
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,700
相信我  你們能幫上大忙
And believe me... we could use the help.

626
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
來吧  小鐵漢  看看你有什么本事
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

627
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,630
我得問你些事兒
Hey, I need to ask you something.

628
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,860
外面的屏障  是你的主意嗎
Was it your idea... to put the barrier... outside?

629
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,030
是他們父親  他們父親知道
Their father. Their father knew.

630
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,390
他們父親沿著建筑外圍
Their father rolled open barrels of the iron shavings

631
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,200
撒了幾桶鐵屑
around the building.

632
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,330
他救了他們的命
He saved their lives.

633
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,360
你父親呢
What happened to your father?

634
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,160
你是個小拳擊手是吧
You're a little scrapper, aren't you?

635
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,260
伙計  你沒事吧  繼續  站起來
Hey, buddy, you all right? Come on, get up.

636
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
你在做什么
What are you doing?

637
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
你是鬼魂嗎
Are you a ghost?

638
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,000
幽魂
Aratare.

639
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,210
他說別說那個詞
He says, "Don't say that word."

640
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,830
問他那些東西是什么
Ask him what they are.

641
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
失落的靈魂
Lost souls.

642
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,060
死者的靈魂
Souls of the dead.

643
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,650
被困在生與死之間
They're trapped between life and death,

644
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,230
無法安息
and they can't find peace.

645
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,300
為什么會這樣
How's that happen?

646
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,860
他說是因為戰爭
He says, "War."

647
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
過來
Come on.

648
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,930
如果是他們的父親撒下了那些鐵屑
If their father was the one who put down the iron shavings,

649
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,260
那他比我們任何人都更了解那些東西
he knows more about these things than any of us do.

650
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,700
問問她父親在哪兒
Ask her where her father is.

651
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,330
她弟弟波格丹還不知道
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

652
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
他以為父親只是出去求助了
He thinks he went to get help.

653
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,330
他是在外面弄屏障的時候死的
He died outside, when he was making the barrier.

654
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,700
她只能把他帶回這里
She had to bring him in here.

655
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
我很遺憾
I'm so sorry.

656
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,760
-我可以嗎  -嗯
- Okay? - Yeah.

657
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,060
陶瓷片
Ceramic tile.

658
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,690
問問她父親是怎么知道
Ask her how her father knew

659
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,860
鐵屑能阻擋幽魂的
about the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

660
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,500
他還知道些什么
What else did he know about them?

661
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,760
她什么都不知道
She doesn't know.

662
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
馬薩羅維
"Masarov."

663
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,900
-馬薩羅維是什么  -是一個地名
- What is Masarov? - It's a place.

664
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,330
上游的一個區域
It's a district up the river.

665
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
是這一切的源頭
It's where it all began.

666
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,630
幽魂殺人就是從那里開始的
It's where the Aratare killings started.

667
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
幽魂
Aratare.

668
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,130
要我說就把直升機停這兒
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

669
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,930
我們從這個屋頂撤離  趕緊離開這里
Extract us from this roof and get us the hell out of here.

670
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
這里到處都是電話線和電力線
There are phone lines and power lines everywhere.

671
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,760
直升機得飛得又低又慢
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

672
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,960
一個小孩都能扛著火箭筒把它打下來
Easy pickings for a teenager with a shoulder rocket.

673
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,750
少校  現在是什么情況
Major, can you get me up to speed?

674
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,760
和基地聯系過了嗎
You spoke with base?

675
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,730
聯系過了  將軍會派直升機來接我們
Yeah. The General's sending in helos to come get us,

676
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,330
以及坦克來確保降落廣場周邊安全
and tanks to secure the landing zone in an open plaza

677
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,670
距這里約八百米  黎明到達
about half a mile from here, at dawn.

678
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,300
步行的話會很遠
That's a long way on foot.

679
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,900
你覺得我們能帶著小孩撐過八百米嗎
You think we can make it a half mile? With kids?

680
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,340
我們別無選擇
We don't have an option. Okay?

681
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,260
所有的路要么被封死要么埋了地雷
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

682
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,330
而且我們用信號塔和基地聯系了
And since we used signal tower to talk to base,

683
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,840
所有人都知道我們的位置
everyone knows where we are.

684
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,860
我們得盡快出去
We gotta move out.

685
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:01,920
那些東西還在街上亂晃
So you wanna go running around out there

686
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,160
你想在這種情況下出去嗎
with those things roaming the streets?

687
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,130
我們還沒有任何看到和對付它們的辦法
Even though we have no way to see or fight?

688
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,400
總比等著它們闖進來要好
Better than waiting for them to find a way in here.

689
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,900
哪里好了
How is it better?

690
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
我們沒死的唯一原因就是外面的那道屏障
The only reason we're still alive is that barricade out there.

691
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,910
它們遲早會進來的
Look, eventually they're gonna get through.

692
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,230
只是時間問題
It's just a matter of time.

693
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,760
-先消停一下  -我們得冒險一試
- Wait, wait, wait. - We have to take our chances.

694
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,930
-這是目前最好的計劃  -少校
- This is the best plan that we have. - Major.

695
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,600
如果我說我能增加成功到達廣場的幾率呢
What if I told you I can improve our chances of making that plaza?

696
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,660
-你說  -看看周圍
- I'm listening. - Take a look around you.

697
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,860
這里到處都是這東西
Everything in this building... is filled with these.

698
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,730
鐵屑
Iron dust.

699
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,600
鐵能阻止那些超光譜異形
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

700
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,700
沒錯  把它做成武器
Exactly. Weaponize it.

701
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
-臟彈  -這是今晚最好的主意
- Dirty bombs. - Best idea I've heard all night.

702
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,360
收集手榴彈
Let's collect the grenades.

703
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,230
克萊恩
Clyne.

704
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,330
在外面我需要你做我們的眼睛
I need you to be our eyes out there.

705
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,520
你能帶著攝像機走路嗎
Can you haul that camera on foot?

706
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,160
我有更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

707
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,300
這個攝像機本身就能投射相符波長的紫外線
This camera already projects the right wavelength of UV light.

708
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,700
如果我能將它內部翻轉過來
If I can turn it inside out,

709
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,260
通過改變一些結構的極性
by reversing the polarity of some of the components,

710
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,330
我也許能把攝像機改造成探照燈
I might be able to turn it from a camera into a searchlight.

711
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
我們憑肉眼就能看見它們
We'll be able to see them with our own eyes.

712
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,250
這能大大改善我們的境況
That'd be a game-changer.

713
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,830
我能和基地的車隊通話嗎
Think I can talk to the convoy?

714
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,080
我或許能告訴它們
I might be albe to tell them

715
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,260
如何對裝備做同樣的調整
how to do the same with their equipment.

716
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,860
他們過來時也需要能看見它們的設備
When they come get us, they're gonna need eyes, too.

717
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,760
我會幫你聯系基地的主工程師
I'll connect you to the main engineer back at base.

718
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,160
收到
Copy that.

719
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,900
他們會在車上裝備任何你需要的東西
They're ready to equip their vehicles with whatever you need.

720
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,800
能將需求列表復述一遍給我嗎
Can you repeat the whole request back to me, please?

721
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,330
對  沒錯
Okay, yes. That's correct.

722
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,810
但你需要的是一個
But what you gonna need is a device

723
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,960
能發射短波長光的裝置
that emits a very short wavelength of light.

724
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,230
我會詳細告訴你怎么改線
I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.

725
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,000
有什么可以裝在坦克上的東西嗎
Do you have anything you can mount on a tank?

726
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,760
小巷那頭有動靜
We got movement across the alleyway.

727
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
伙計們  有動靜  能看看是什么嗎
Guys, we got movement. Can we get eyes on it?

728
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,200
麻煩讓一下
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

729
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,620
車隊那邊怎么說
What's the word on the convoy?

730
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,200
上次通訊在50分鐘以前
Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

731
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,000
他們在前往撤離點的路上

我們的常規武器毫無作用
Our conventional weapons were useless.

887
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,660
我請求下令撤離基地...
I requested an order to evacuate the base...

888
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,100
但遠距離通訊系統完全被擾亂
But our long-range come are completely scrambled.

889
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,900
所以我把能帶的裝備都帶上
So, I took all the gear I could.

890
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,030
開始讓各小隊向北撤離行動區
I started sending units north out of the area of operation.

891
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,930
讓五架飛機保持最小耗燃量
Kept five aircraft with the least amount of fuel,

892
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,360
跟著一個排殿后
stayed behind with one platoon.

893
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,330
我們240人只剩下19個了
Out of the 240 of us, we have 19 remaining.

894
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,960
有成功向上級通報嗎
Did you get a message to higher command?

895
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
沒有
No.

896
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,010
有安排救援計劃嗎
Is there a rescue mission planned?

897
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,630
沒有  我們截取了
No. We intercepted radio chatter

898
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,800
摩爾多瓦友方無線電信號才找到這里
from Moldovan friendlies to find this place.

899
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,160
我們派出直升機接你們過來
We sent that bird to pick you up and bring you here.

900
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,700
你們要是試著回基地  就已經沒命了
If you'd even tried to return to base, you'd be dead.

901
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,200
我們是這個國家最后的美軍嗎
We're the last U.S. Forces in the country?

902
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
但愿如此
I hope so.

903
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,660
有什么計劃嗎  長官
So, what's the plan, sir?

904
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,600
來這里重新部署  少校
Came here to regroup, Major.

905
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,330
沒什么計劃
There's no plan.

906
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,800
-我建議加固入口  -用什么加固
- I recommend we fortify the entrance. - Fortify with what?

907
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,700
-我們等待救援...  -用什么加固
- We wait till a rescue mission... - Fortify with what?

908
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,660
無論你用什么東西  他們都能穿過
They'll come through whatever you use.

909
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,810
我們得用直升機碰一碰運氣...
We need to take our chances get on one of our helos...

910
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,600
只能飛二十分鐘
Twenty minutes of flight time!

911
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,560
直升機只剩二十分鐘的飛行時間了
There's twenty minutes of flight time in those birds.

912
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,560
飛不了更久了
Not more!

913
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
沒關系  反正也裝不下所有人
Doesn't matter, there's not enough room for all of us...

914
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,350
我們得組隊乘飛機
We need to form teams and take the aircraft.

915
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,000
但你要去哪里  少校
But where you gonna go, Major?

916
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,600
你們躲不掉它們
You can't run from them.

917
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,060
你們無法阻止它們  你們的武器毫無作用
You can't stop them. Your weapons are useless.

918
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,100
我們不知道它們到底是什么
We have no idea what they are!

919
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,160
要是它們穿門而入  我們只能坐以待斃
If they come through that door, we're sitting ducks.

920
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,230
我們阻止不了它們  我們阻止不了它們
We can't stop them! We can't stop them!

921
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,230
把我們能帶走的都帶走
Take what we can and go.

922
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:58,830
我知道它們是什么了

924
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,060
我知道它們是什么了
I know what they are.

925
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,360
我們覺得我們見鬼了
We think we're seeing things.

926
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,000
我們覺得它不是真的  但它有殺傷力
We think it can't be real, but it kills.

927
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:15,800
所以它是真的
So, it is real.

928
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
是一種物質
It's something.

929
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,490
非光非影
It's not light, it's not shadow,

930
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:21,900
不是幻覺  可以穿墻  沒錯

931
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,960
屬于非可見光譜  沒錯
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

932

936
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,640
它不能穿過瓷制品
It cannot pass through ceramic.

937
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,760
你們知道這意味著什么嗎
You know what that means?

938
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,200
意味著這東西不是天然的
It means this stuff isn't natural.

939
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
有人創造了它
Someone made it.

940
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:50,630
它是人造的
It's man-made.

941
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,000
怎么人造的

01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:02,060
金屬能熔化  這些都是自然狀態
Metals can melt. These are natural states.

946
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,570
但也有非自然狀態

會被鐵屑減速
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

954
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,030
它不能穿過瓷制品  但卻可以穿墻

955
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
溫度太低以致于一觸即死
It's so cold it will kill you instantly on contact.

956
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,700
它可以解釋我們所見的一切

957
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,550
要想產生波色-愛因斯坦凝聚態
You want to create Bose-Einstein condensate.

958
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:29,330
你們需要能量  大量的能量

962
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,060
這就是武器
This is a weapon.

963
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,320
這要么是有意釋放  要么是意外爆發
And it was set loose, or it broke loose.

964
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,030
好吧  但這些東西會爬
All right, but these things climb.

965
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
它們就像人類  看起來像人一樣
They're like human beings. It looks like a person.

01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,780
它們為什么看起來像人
Why they look like people.

969
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,330
我不知道它們是怎么做的
I can't tell you how they did this.

970
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,630
我只能告訴你它們是人造的
What I can tell you... is that someone made them.

971
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,340
如果是人造的
If someone made them,

972
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,640
它們就逃不開世界的規律
they don't escape the laws of the world.

973
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,700
沒有東西能逃開
Nothing does.

974
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,800
它適用于我們需要了解的新規律
It shines light on new laws, and that's what we have to learn.

975
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,680
因為它們有序有結構
Cause they have order and structure.

976
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,000
它們就可以被瓦解
They can be broken down.

977
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,820
任何東西都可以被瓦解  全看所需的能量

979
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,280
知道了特性  我就可以造出對應的武器
I know the properties, I can build the right weapons.

980
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,330
什么樣的武器

981
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,690
等離子放電槍  它們可以瓦解凝聚態
Plasmic-discharge weapons. They can tear apart the condensate.

982
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,650
你讓我們上哪里找那種武器
Where do you expect that we can find weapons like that?

983
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,130
我們不找  我們自己造
We're not gonna find them, we're gonna build them.

984
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,920
用什么造
Build them with what?

985

989
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,000
接著我們可以去馬薩羅維
And then we can go to Masarov

990
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,900
在事態進一步惡化前阻止它
and we can stop this before it goes any further.

991
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,140
因為如果我們不去
Because if we don't,

992
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,630
一路汲取所有能量的凝聚態
the condensate which feed on all the energy in its path

993
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,580
會呈指數型增長
will grow exponentially.

994
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
傳播的范圍將難以估量
There's no limit to how far they can spread,

995
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,660
除非我們阻止它們
unless we stop them.

996
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,630
伙計們  把零件拖進去  加把勁
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

每邊的數字一樣
Same number each side.

999
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,830
好了  動起來  兄弟們
All right, let's go, boys!

1000
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,000
有MED部件嗎
Any med patches in there?

1001
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,800
我在這找到三個
We got three of them over here.

1002
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,790
這是地對空追蹤瞄準鏡

1005
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,760
看到那個305了嗎
See that 305?

1006
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,680
半數被貼上了"殘次品"標簽
Half of these are labeled "Defective."

1007
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,190
我們需要一個反向電壓
We're gonna need a voltage counter.

1008
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,600
你們現在就開始測試這些東西
I want you to start testing these.

1009
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,230
好了  打開
All right, open it up.

1010
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,760
打開  掀開
Get that one open. Pop it.

1011
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,230
和我想的一樣嗎
Is that what I think it is?

1012
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,930
我們從基地拿來的路特斯
We got the Lotus from base.

1013
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
太厲害了
That's badass.

1014
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,130
-像一只機械羅特韋爾犬  -看啊
- Looks like a mechanical rottweiler. - Look at that.

1015
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,060
克萊恩做了些調整
Clyne's making a few changes.

他們在卸下鏈式起重機  裝上探照燈
They're taking down a chain hoist and putting up a searchlight.

1017
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,960
似曾相識嘛
Déjà vu.

1018
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,000
-它發射什么  -一種聚焦能量脈沖
- What does it fire? - It's a focused energy pulse.

1019
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,030
如果我沒算錯的話
If my math is right...

1020
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,960
它應該可以瓦解凝聚態
it should break down condensate.

1021
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,570
馬薩羅維
Masarov.

1022
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,030
本地區唯一的最大的核電站

1023
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,250
也是死亡的發源地
It's where the killings started.

1024
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,200
如果它們是人造的  那一定就是在這里
If they're man-made, they were made here.

1025
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,060
距離這里不到十公里
It's less than ten klicks from here.

1026
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:47,360
飛機可以到達  但可能只有一條路
Our birds can make that, but... it's probably one way.

1027
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,150
我一直在當地居民那里挖掘線索
I've been digging for clues with the civilians here.

1028
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,830
我找到了關于馬薩羅維的情報
I found this intel on Masarov.

1029
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,160
在過去十年間  它被中央政權
It's been retrofitted several times over the last decade

1030
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,660
翻新過很多次
by the central regime.

1031
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,280
表面寫滿了"武器研究"的字樣
It's got "Weapons research" written all over it.

1032
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,020
好的  你和克萊恩需要潛進去
Okay, you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate.

1033
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,680
就指望你們弄清楚怎么停止這一切了
It's gonna be up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this.

1034
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
我們得聲東擊西
We have to create a diversion.

1035
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,710
我們會在這里吸引它們好讓你們潛入內部
We'll draw them out here so you can infiltrate the structure

1036
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,000
試著找到源頭
and try to find the source.

1037
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,110
克萊恩說這些武器會釋放高溫電流
Clyne's predicting the charge from these weapons will be extremely hot.

1038
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,960
足夠摧毀凝聚態
Enough to destroy condensate.

1039
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,240
我們很快就可以驗證一下了
We'll find out soon enough.

1040
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:28,830
好了  兄弟們
All right, boys.

1041
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,730
就這樣了
This is it.

1042
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,760
如果還有什么遺言
If you have any last words...

1043
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,630
現在說吧
now's the time.

1044
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,230
好  聽好了
All right, listen up.

1045
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,120
你們用的是未經測試的武器
You are using untested weapons...

1046
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,860
抵抗此刻看來是無法被擊退的敵人
against an enemy that, to this point, has been unstoppable.

1047
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,620
現在你們要前往未知的領地
Now, you are heading into unknown territory.

1048
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:17,340
聽清楚了
And hear me when I say

1049
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,300
你們會看到一些無法理解的東西
you're gonna see things you will not understand.

1050
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,940
我們的敵人已在數日之內遍布全城
Our enemy has spread through the city in a matter of days.

1051
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,820
不知道它們會傳播多遠
There's no telling how far they will spread...

1052
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,680
除非我們反擊
unless we fight back.

1053
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:34,160
很多人都不曾有機會改變未來
Most men never even come close... to changing the future.

1054
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,360
此地
This is the place.

1055
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,030
此刻
And now is the time.

1056
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,900
毫無疑問  你們是最后一道防線
Make no mistake, you're the last line of defense.

1057
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,830
讓我們完成最初的使命
Let's go do what we came here to do.

1058
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,160
出發  出發
Let's go, let's go!

先鋒一號  準備下降
Spearhead 1, proceed with descent.

1062
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,360
好了  出發
All right, let's go.

1063
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,100
我們走
Here we go.

1064
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
行動
Let's move!

1065
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,660
發現目標
We have a visual.

1066
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,760
敵方目標聚集在12點方向平臺東端
Hostile target gathering at 12 o'clock on east end of platform.

1067
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,660
行動
Move, move!

1068
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,960
可以射擊
We are a go.

1069

確認殺死一只幽魂
I have a confirmed spectral kill.

1070
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,760
可以行動  重復  全體行動

收到  先鋒一隊  全體進攻
Copy, Spearhead 1. All units engage.

1075
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,380
先鋒二隊控制北半島
Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula.

1076
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,660
先鋒三隊開始進攻南半島
Spearhead 3 beginning descent over south peninsula.

1077
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,660
至少出現了一打目標
At least a dozen targets coming out.

1078
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,000

在你身后
Right behind you!

1084

先鋒二隊  目標內部設施  前往滲入點
Spearhead 2, you're go for infield. Proceed to insertion point.

1089
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,130
走走走

1090
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,900
趴下

1096
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,360
-更多目標出現  -保持隊形

1097
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,630
前進
Let's move it!

1098
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,260

-有情況報告嗎  -馬上
- Do we have a sit-rep? - Right now.

1102
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,600
克萊恩  下面情況如何
Clyne, what's the situation down there?

1103
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,730
塞申斯  我們被分開了
Sessions, we got split up.

1104
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,820
還在尋找實驗室
We're still looking for the lab.

1105
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,600
我們還在撐著  不知道能撐多久
We're holding. Don't know how long.

1106
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,830
-收到了嗎  -能聽到嗎  塞申斯
- Do you copy? - Can you hear me? Sessions?

1107
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260
我們得繼續前進
We gotta keep going.

1108
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,060
肯定很近了
We gotta be close now.

1109
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,060
天哪
God.

1110
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,900
看這里
Look over here.

1111
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,660
波色-愛因斯坦凝聚態
Bose-Einstein condensate.

1112
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,200
看那些X光線
Look at these x-rays.

1113
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,330
他們在掃描人類  而且是分子級別的
They were scanning people. On a molecular level.

1114
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,800
然后用凝聚態打印出來
And printing them out of condensate.

1115
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,030
這是條裝配線
It's an assembly line.

1116
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,260
就像某種...
Like some kind of...

1117
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,000
工業生產線
Industrial process.

1118
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,760
沒錯
You're right.

1119
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,800
這就是個武器
It's a weapon.

1120
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,130
這里發生了什么
What happened here?

1121
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:22,100
看起來像是出現了災難性故障
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

1122
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,630
一半單元格破損而且已經空了
Half the cells are broken and empty.

1123
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,060
肯定是結構損壞讓它們逃了出來
Some structural failure must have set them free.

1124
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,600
打開了潘多拉魔盒
Opened up pandora's box.

1125
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,730
現在怎么辦
Now what?

1126
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
敵人出現
Incoming!

1127
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,760
12點鐘方向
Hey, 12 o'clock!

1128
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,930
-開槍  -它起來了  它們又聚合了
- Do it! - It's up! They're coming back together!

1129
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
-要來了  -瞄準目標
- They're moving! - All eyes on target.

1130
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,760
-有一個重新聚合了  -干掉它
- One of them is reforming. - Bring it down!

1131
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,130
中央政府高端研究顧問
"Top research advisers of the central regime."

1132
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,360
他想要阻止這個局面的  確實是失控了
This man was trying to stop it. They did lose control.

1133
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,630
你能翻譯這個嗎
Can you translate this?

1134
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,010
是緊急關閉程序
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.

1135
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,630
上面一半的字我都沒見過
Half these words I've never seen.

1136
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,860
另一半寫的什么
What about the other half?

1137
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,000
解耦  解耦程序
"Decouple... decouple procedure.

1138
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,220
斷開臍帶鏈接
Disconnect the umbilicals to,

1139
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,200
以中斷神經活動
uh... interrupt the... neural activity."

1140
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,660
-好的  -所以你得解鎖所有端口
- Okay. - So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

1141
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,120
然后拉這個
And then you gotta pull

1142
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,200
操縱桿  斷開所有電纜
this bracket here to release all the cables.

1143
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,000
然后呢
And then?

1144
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,900
應該就能阻止它們了
That should stop them.

1145
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,260
拿著
Take this.

1146
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,330
快點  給我起來
Come on! Get up!

1147
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,200
在那里  又增加了
Right there! There's more!

1148
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,600
又出現一個
Another one!

1149
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,300
就在那
Got it right there!

1150
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,730
-克萊恩  -我知道
- Clyne! - I know!

1151
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,660
搞什么
What the hell?

1152
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,200
我都斷開了  沒有用啊
I did them all. Nothing's happening.

1153
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:02,900
克萊恩  拉操縱桿  中間那個
Clyne! Pull the bracket! In the middle!

1154
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,930
-不  -不
- No! - No!

1155
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:46,060
-結束了嗎  -不知道
- Is it over? - I don't know.

1156
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,300
你還能走路嗎
Can you walk?

1157
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,630
-我沒事  -來吧
- I'm all right. - Come on.

1158
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,700
我們得找條出路
We have to find a way out.

1159
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,330
-聽到了嗎  -聽到了
- Do you hear that? - Yeah.

1160
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
是這里了
This is it.

1161
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,600
他們不只是掃描人類
They weren't just scanning people.

1162
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,030
它們也不僅僅是打印物
They're not just printouts.

1163
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,900
這是控制他們的東西
This is what's controlling them.

1164
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,330
這些是真正的尸體
These are from real corpses.

1165
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,630
每一個都是一條生命
Each one is made from a real person.

1166
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,700
他們都還活著嗎
They're alive?

1167
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:19,830
并非活著
They're not alive.

1168
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
但也沒有死亡
They're not dead.

1169
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,700
他們被困在了生死之間
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

1170
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,360
但是十分痛苦
But they are in pain.

1171
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1172
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,630
這就是痛苦
This is pain.

1173
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,260
那你怎么知道他們能感覺到
But how do you know they can feel?

1174
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:46,860
我無法證明
I can't prove it.

1175
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,700
確實
I can't.

1176
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,030
也許科學確實無法回答一切問題
So, maybe there are things science can't answer.

1177
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,630
不
No.

1178
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,100
等等  不要
Wait, no.

1179
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,160
這是我們來這里的目的
