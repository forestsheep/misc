17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,600
Acknowledge when in position, Sergeant Davis.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,960
Dagger team 1, copy. I keep losing you.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,220
How long till my backup's here?

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,630
Working on it. Stand by.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,860
Say eight to ten minutes. Advise you stay put.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,630
I can't wait for backup.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Send them in behind me.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,260
Davis, maintain your position. They're on their way.

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,350
Dagger team 1, are you seeing this?

26
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,130
There's some kind of disturbance here.

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,230
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

28
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,600
What the hell?

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Davis.

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
Davis, what's your status?

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Davis, come in!

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Got you.

34
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,330
Gonna get a late start.

35
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
Right, well, it's a closed session.

36
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,660
Most of the specs stayed the same...

37
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,600
Dr. Osbourne, call 204. Dr. Osbourne, call 204.

38
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,960
They're issuing temporaries for that R and D, as far as I know.

39
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,830
Is that part of the same BADGE or...?

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

41
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,100
- All right. - How's it going?

42
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
- We'll get everything. - Marty was already in?

43
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,700
- Yeah. - And she's working on that project?

44
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,160
They'll be done in about a week. I was gonna say...

45
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,130
Don Taylor, report to laser laboratory building B, laser lab.

46
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
Okay, I'll take a look.

47
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,620
- Where have you been? - Solving problems.

48
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,720
You look... dusty.

49
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,630
Sometimes you gotta get dusty, Efrem.

50
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
- Test the pulse? - Yeah.

51
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,860
Went down to the vault, asked Johnson for some tetracene,

52
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,800
but apparently, we don't store it.

53
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,260
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

54
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,030
It got expensive. Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

55
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,160
So, if you look hard enough...

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,960
You can still find some lying around.

57
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,300
You find a street gang that slings tetracene?

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,830
Industrial printer cartridge, $14.99 back in the day.

59
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,890
- Get me a mount, would you? - Here, here you go.

60
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,030
Thank you.

61
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,000
You gonna tell the suits

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,930
you're running this on a 20-year-old part, right?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,130
I'll show them it works and I'm gonna tell them:

64
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,010
"That's the difference between

65
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,830
a prototype and a production model."

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay.

67
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,200
Concavity is spun to zero.

68
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,730
Lens track is hot.

69
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,930
Alignment is keyed in.

70
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,630
You are good to go.

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,630
I'll let you call it.

72
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,900
If you think about the applications on other materials,

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,930
it could be fairly significant.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,360
Metals, for instance,

75
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,030
can be shattered with very little effort or noise.

76
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,760
Concrete, rubber...

77
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,000
they're all vulnerable to violent temperature changes.

78
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,760
Yeah, this project started as a request from Seal Team 6.

79
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,200
After the siege in Rwanda,

80
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,330
they came to us asking for the capability to

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,630
flash freeze or boil the enemy's water supply.

82
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,200
Now, this device could have driven the enemy out.

83
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,150
And you... tried this on living things?

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,660
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

85
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,180
We'd like you test it.

86
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,360
Any volunteers?

87
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,000
Well... we'll give it a try.

88
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,250
Gentlemen, why don't we go have a sit down?

89
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,800
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

90
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,830
Yeah. Right this way.

91
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,030
What do you want, a clean conscience?

92
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,660
Test it with a slab of beef for all I care.

93
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,830
What I want is to use it for what we originally designed it as.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
A deterrent.

95
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,450
Nobody said anything about microwaving people's lungs.

96
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,330
It's war.

97
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,960
It's the business we're in.

98
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,360
Remember what you sold it to me as when you hired me?

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,730
Defense.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
And that's still partially true.

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,800
But war is good business.

102
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,300
So is human trafficking.

103
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
We work for DARPA, Mark.

104
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
We work for the government.

105
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,260
"I don't know what weapons we'll use to fight in World War III,

106
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,350
but World War IV will be fought with..."

107
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,600
"Sticks and stones." said Albert Einstein.

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,630
- He worked for the government. - That's right.

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,980
And if you ask him, I don't think

110
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,730
he thought that was his finest hour.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm sure he has feelings about flash-boiling human flesh.

112
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,800
Ever think about prosthetic limbs with full sensory feedback?

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,780
Prosthetics... don't win wars.

114
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,930
Did you hear that?

115
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,750
That is the empathetic scientist in you dying.

116
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,600
Did you brief your guys on how to operate the ray?

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,000
- I did. - Good.

118
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,730
Then you can start packing.

119
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,000
Can you be more specific?

120
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,410
About these goggles here.

121
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,250
Your... hyperspectral goggles being deployed by

122
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,030
special forces in eastern Europe in the Moldovan war.

123
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm aware. I read the field reports.

124
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,130
No, you have not read this report.

125
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,800
Orland called me personally. General Orland.

126
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,620
He said things are very... sensitive down there.

127
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,110
And they're... seeing things.

128
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,750
Okay. Like what?

129
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
They won't tell me.

130
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
They won't share the video feed.

131
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,660
They won't discuss what they're seeing.

132
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,180
They just want the lead engineer

133
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,950
down there to advise and consult.

134
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,220
Look, you invented these goggles to keep our guys safe.

135
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,060
Well, now they need your help.

136
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,550
Think of it as defense.

137
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,480
Let me reboot the guidance system.

138
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,560
It's locked tight. We have to pull it out.

140
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
All right, let's go. Move it out.

141
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,300
- Mark Clyne? - What?

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,890
You the guy that designed the helmet cam?

143
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes. Mark clyne.

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,600
James Orland. Come with me.

145
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
A lot of new boots on the ground here.

146
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,630
The country's in chaos.

147
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,810
The insurgency is mostly remnants of the military dictatorship

148
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,660
that ran this place until about two months ago.

149
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,890
And their popular support

150
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,460
is primarily in the north part of the country,

151
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,800
near the Russian border, and here in the capital.

152
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,160
The problem is their forces are well-trained.

153
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,660
They're threatening to turn this whole thing into a civil war.

154
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,200
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

155
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,660
It became independent, but it's struggling internally.

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

157
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,700
made up of the regime's former elite soldiers.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,780
They're well-trained and dangerous.

159
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
On the other, you have most of the population,

160
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
who are tearing down the regime's flags

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
and demanding a new government.

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,790
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,

163
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,960
is a business we're familiar with.

164
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,700
We like to think we're good at it.

165
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,730
But this thing your camera found...

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,300
It's a whole new piece of business.

167
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,340
I can't send this video to EUCOM.

168
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,230
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,030
Typically not. Hook us up.

171
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation for what's on these,

172
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,030
but until you tell me,

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm not sending it up the chain of command.

174
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,130
- You done? - Yes, sir.

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside. - Sir.

176
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Nobody here has been able to make heads or tails of this.

177
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,160
It's thrown a wrench into our entire operation

178
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,830
for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss with you.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,730
I can tell you we need answers fast.

180
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
- Do you mind? - You spotted that quick.

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,900
Five different helmet cams

182
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,360
picked up something similar in the last three weeks.

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,170
At first, our signals

184
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
intelligence tech wrote it off as interference.

185
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,330
That's not interference.

186
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
I don't think you'd fly me all the way here

187
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,660
for interference.

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,130
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
I want you to tell me what you're thinking.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,630
But there is an explanation.

192
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,730
That was the first sighting. Three others just like it.

193
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,180
The last was different.

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,130
It involved a member of Delta Force,

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,960
that makes it particularly sensitive.

196
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,100
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

197
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,700
What special ops does here is done under CIA covert operations.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
You need to sign this before we go any further.

199
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,330
- What is this? - It's an SCI oath.

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,090
You're acknowledging it's life

201
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,330
in prison if you reveal anything you're told.

203
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,700
- Cue up the Davis file, please. - Yes, ma'am.

204
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Three days ago we conducted a raid in mid-city.

205
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,390
Our communications were intermittent,

206
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,260
and a guy got separated from the group...

207
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
Where he ended up killed in action.

208
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,300
He got closer than anybody.

209
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Too close.

210
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
Dagger team 1, you seeing this?

211
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,630
There's some kind of disturbance here.

212
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,630
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

213
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,000
What the hell?

214
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,930
Sergeant Chris Davis.

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,260
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

216
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,800
In the last few weeks we've been finding bodies around the city

217
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
that were killed in the same way.

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
The autopsies defied all explanation.

219
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,730
Their internal organs were frozen

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,830
and yet, their skin was burned and corroded.

221
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
The only response from the allied

222
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,660
Moldovan military contact is shock, confusion.

223
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,930
And there's anger.

224
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,690
There's teenagers

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,330
spray-painting "Genocide Aratare" at kill sites.

226
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,730
- Genocide...? - "Aratare."

227
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,330
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,300
"As nightmarish as." That's the literal translation.

229
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,160
- That's very poetic. - Well, they're superstitious.

230
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,030
They somehow think...

231
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,760
the horrors of the war have kicked up something unnatural.

232
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,360
- We hope you have an alternate theory. - What do you think?

233
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,390
Think you need a new name for them.

234
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,900
Beyond that.

235
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,290
Give me a copy of the data, some time...

236
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,700
That's not possible.

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,800
You want me to figure this out right now?

238
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,100
- We want your assessment. - I don't have one yet.

239
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,490
Then, I think we have to send our working theory

240
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,600
up the chain of command.

241
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,710
I don't wanna do that.

242
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,230
Okay. What is your working theory?

243
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,660
The agency thinks this is some kind of cloaking technology.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,230
Insurgent soldiers wearing active camouflage.

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,230
In this country? Something that advanced?

246
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,710
CIA knows a few groups in Europe

247
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,800
and Asia could be working on active camouflage.

248
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,230
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,000
We're years away from a prototype.

250
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
Maybe somebody beat you to it.

251
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,330
DARPA is the leader in the field.

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Are you certain of that?

253
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,800
The regime spent heavily on weapons research.

254
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
Corruption, loose legislation.

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,260
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

256
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,830
- This is a great place to work and hide. - Okay.

257
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,260
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,680
How do you account for cause of death?

259
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,260
A shock delivered to the victim.

260
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I think you're reaching.

261
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,660
Our business requires us to make suppositions.

262
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,600
My business requires us to prove them.

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
Your technician's job is to find glitches,

264
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,760
so, he sees glitches.

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,210
Your job is to find the enemy,

266
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,300
so, you see the enemy.

267
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,360
Locals believe in spirits, so they see spirits.

268
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,030
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

269
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,390
So, my answer to you right

270
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,660
now is that we lack data to support any theory.

271
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Okay.

272
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,930
What do you need to make a more definitive statement?

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,300
First, you need a better shot.

274
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,630
That's what I'm looking for, a better shot.

275
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,260
How?

276
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,230
- Right here, sir. - That's it.

277
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,230
I brought this from DARPA. A hyperspectral camera.

278
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,260
A more powerful version of the helmet cams your guys are using.

279
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,740
Visible or invisible, if something's there,

281
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,600
this'll pick it up.

282
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,260
Can you mount this thing... on a delta vehicle?

283
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,300
- I don't see why not. - All right, good.

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
We run missions into the city every day.

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll put you with our field tech, tell him how to operate it.

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,160
I wouldn't put a tech in between this camera and myself.

287
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,060
So, you wanna operate it?

288
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,370
If you want that kill shot...

289
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,600
you'll need a fast reaction time out there.

290
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,700
Next mission, you ride with delta.

291
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,610
They're gonna get you close to this thing.

292
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,100
You get me the kill shot...

293
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,060
you can go home to Virginia without unpacking.

294
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,630
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

295
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
Weld it onto the front panel.

296
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

297
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,200
- What's this guy up to, man? - I don't know.

298
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,600
Believe this guy?

299
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,330
- If it works. - For real.

300
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,130
Heard you're installing a camera on our truck.

301
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Which was fine until you ripped out that 50 Cal.

302
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
You're taking down a gun to put up a camera?

303
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,200
It's the only place large enough to mount it.

304
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,130
You guys get that, right? I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

305
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,110
We prefer to dance with who brung us...

306
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,930
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,230
"Dance with who brung you"? No, actually, I don't.

308
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
This truck has saved our lives, many times.

309
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
I understand.

310
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
You guys know Dr. Clyne's team built that truck?

311
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,700
Clyne works over at DARPA.

312
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,170
I've worked closely with his group.

313
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,200
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

314
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,400
Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.

315
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,660
Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

316
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,960
They retrofitted these trucks with tougher, lighter weight armor.

317
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,960
They designed the mechanical loaders that do the heavy lifting,

318
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,200
so you boys don't strain yourselves too hard.

319
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,330
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,660
developed the thin weight Kevlar body stocking that literally...

321
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
protects your balls.

322
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,390
So, I would think there'd be

323
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,000
nothing but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

324
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,200
- Major Sessions. - Captain, have your men fall back.

325
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,360
- Get back to it. - Get it done.

326
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,330
Major, this is Dr. Clyne.

327
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,300
He's worked with us eight or ten times over the last five years.

328
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,060
You go out with the assault team on hunting ghost?

329
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
No, sir.

330
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,760
He's a good man, major.

331
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,100
That's great. I'm just not a fan of taking tourists on combat missions.

332
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,600
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

333
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,230
If you're not carrying an M4, you're a tourist.

334
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
I can carry one, if you'd like.

335
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,600
Major, we gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

336
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,900
so he can track the target force and get us a kill shot.

337
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,000
How long before this equipment's operational?

338
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
A few hours.

339
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,700
- Is it gonna work? - If we get close enough.

340
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
Let me tell you something. Sergeant Davis...he got close enough.

341
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,730
That's the best delta that we had.

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,100
Make sure your equipment is top-notch this time.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,060
- They were like brothers. - I get it.

344
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

345
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,030
Evening, doc.

346
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,860
Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

347
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,760
- She can come off a bit intense. - Yeah. So can you.

348
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm just here to find this thing.

349
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
You're willing to go on a combat mission to find it.

350
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,830
She is, too.

351
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,160
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

352
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,830
They want an answer and it's her job to give them one.

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
Saw your names on a mission roster.

354
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,860
I knew this was a top priority...

355
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,000
but for them to embed you both...

356
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,100
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,930
I'm not worried about you, doc. I'm worried about it.

358
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,060
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

359
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,860
What do you think it is?

360
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,360
Something no one's thought of yet.

361
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,330
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

362
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,330
Utah team left here on a recon mission to Durlesti,

363
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
when they were engaged by insurgents.

364
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,230
We managed to hear most of their chatter during the firefight,

365
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
but comes were unreliable.

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,900
Target is a five-story apartment building here.

367
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,030
We think what's left of utah team is being held on the fourth floor,

368
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,860
in the northwest corner apartment.

369
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,260
We're gonna be knee-deep in an insurgent-held area in the city.

370
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,330
So, we should expect a fight.

371
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,130
One last thing.

372
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,070
Before our guys were grabbed,

373
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,600
they radioed in that they saw

374
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
what we're now calling hyperspectral anomalies.

375
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,010
Your mission is a quick extraction.

376
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,700
You get our guys and you get out.

377
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,160
However, if engaged, neutralize the anomalies in the area.

378
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
Neutralize them?

379
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,200
- How? - Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

380
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,830
We believe these are enemy soldiers in advanced electronic camouflage.

381
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,190
So, be surgical when you fire. If they are...

382
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,740
If we don't really know what they are, maybe we should...

383
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,860
Excuse me? Would you like to add something?

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

385
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,730
you need to bring it back as intact as possible.

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison will be on mission with you.

387
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,760
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring your helmet-cam feeds

388
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,800
from the second MRAP vehicle in the convoy.

389
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Major Sessions will lead dagger team 1 to do the extraction.

390
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,800
Stay on come. Get your gear.

391
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,820
Partner, let's go.

392
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,230
AJ, front and center.

393
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Weapons check, Billy.

394
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,860
You got it.

395
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,160
Our ride not smooth enough for you?

397
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,330
They really need to repave these roads, man.

398
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,130
All right, guys, we're coming into the abandoned zone.

399
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,630
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

400
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Okay.

401
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,340
I've got an insurgent body here.

402
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,100
I got Agopia from Utah team. Confirmed KIA.

403
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,780
None of these guys appear to have taken any rounds.

404
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,100
No entry or exit wounds.

405
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,160
Alessio here. Moving to the fifth floor.

406
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,600
- We got movement in there. - Toll, check your 2 o'clock.

407
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,100
Where? We don't see anything.

408
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,660
- That's it. Right there. - You're right on top of it.

409
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,660
It's a motion signature. There's something under that tub.

410
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,930
Lewis, the tub. I want you to flip over the tub.

411
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,360
- Toll, I want you on what's underneath. - I'm on it.

412
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,000
One, two, three.

413
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,800
We have Comstock alive and conscious.

414
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,900
Repeat. We have Sergeant Comstock from Utah team.

415
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
Hey, buddy.

416
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
- Where's the rest of your team? - They're upstairs.

417
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,800
But they're all gone. Got under their skin.

418
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,930
- What got under their skin... ? - I saw it.

419
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,300
- But...? - Blanket.

420
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,860
Like a frozen blanket.

421
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,130
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah? - Oh, they're dead.

422
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,630
Yeah, they're all dead.

423
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,330
We're all dead.

424
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,100
- Where are the bodies? - I told you, they're on the top floor.

425
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
Oh, you haven't seen it.

426
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I've seen it. You know I believe in God, John.

427
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,730
This is the opposite of god.

428
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,860
Wait wait wait. Who's this right there? Can you tell him to turn back?

429
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,040
McFadden, turn back.

430
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,260
Give us a view of that room.

431
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,170
Nothing's there, guys. I'm standing right here.

432
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,950
Mac, we're both staring right at it.

433
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
It's in the middle of your view port.

434
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,600
What? That? It's a smear.

435
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,860
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

436
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,510
No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.

437
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,900
Mac, put the goggles back on.

438
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
Mac, do it now.

439
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
- What the...? - Take the shot.

440
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,260
Did you see that? The bullets right through it.

441
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,900
- Did he miss? - He doesn't miss.

442
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Major Sessions, we have a KIA. McFadden.

443
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,000
A hyperspectral target is on the fifth floor, northwest corner.

444
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,700
Switch to heavy rounds or 203s.

445
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
Whatever you have to do to bring this thing down.

446
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Tell your man to pull out.

447
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,830
There!

448
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,330
Get everyone out now!

449
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,890
Tell them to pull out now.

450
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,600
No, no way, we're not leaving empty-handed.

451
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,360
I can guarantee you're leaving empty-handed.

452
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Come on!

453
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,830
Grenade!

454
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,030
- We need support! - Get out.

455
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,030
All units evacuate now. Let's go. Get back to the truck.

456
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,260
- This room right here. We can still grab him. - Let's go! Move!

457
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,330
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

458
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
Go!

459
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,960
Here. Here, Jim. Hold on. Here.

460
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,560
Evacuating via south face!

461
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,990
I got Talbot, Comstock,

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,660
Riedel and Shaire.

463
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,900
Five men down!

464
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,400
We gotta travel together

465
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,630
and we gotta stay tight. Can you do that?

466
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,700
Oh, Jesus. Go!

467
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,360
Come on. Come on.

468
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,630
Move. Move, move.

469
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,930
You got him? Let's go.

470
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Get out of the way.

471
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,260
Where?

472
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,060
- Right there! - Where is it?

473
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,330
In front.

474
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,600
We gotta get in.

475
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,100
- Help him in. - Come on!

476
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,300
- Get in here! - In you go.

477
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
No.

478
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,200
No.

479
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,900
Go, go!

480
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,330
- Move! - Get in.

481
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,700
Go, go!

482
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,960
We're in! Go!

483
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,930
Hold on, where's Cabrera? Where's the captain?

484
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,330
Talk to me. Did you see him?

485
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
- Come on, talk to me, man. - I saw him die.

486
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,630
- What? - I saw him die.

487
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,260
- I'm going home. - Yeah.

488
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,300
- I'm going home. - Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

489
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,600
Look at me. Look at me.

490
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,900
- Did you see it? - Yeah.

491
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,430
You saw it. How close did you get?

492
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,200
I was in a room with it for hours.

493
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,000
That tub saved my life.

494
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I could feel it.

495
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,660
I could feel it.

496
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Land mines! Hold on!

497
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Hey, buddy, look at me. No, no, no.

498
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Shit.

499
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,630
Open the door.

500
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,760
- Come on. Now, move. - Come on.

501
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,100
Both drivers are dead.

502
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,000
Archer Lima 2. Hit a land mine.

503
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,700
Both vehicles destroyed.

504
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,230
We are...

505
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,700
three clicks southeast of target building.

506
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,520
We are losing your transmission.

507
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,860
Your transponders are down.

508
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,260
No shit. Our vehicles were just blown to hell.

509
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,600
We need to find cover.

510
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,580
I can't hear what you're saying.

511
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,200
Clyne, leave the camera.

512
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,030
Come on, clyne.

513
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Go, go, go.

514
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Move, move.

515
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Cover.

516
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,700
- Let's go. - Get up, get up.

517
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,130
Come on.

518
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,730
Go, go, go.

519
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,200
Where you been?

520
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,900
Clear.

521
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Who's injured?

522
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,730
- Diaz? - I think my ankle's broke.

523
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,540
We need an airlift. I can't get a signal to base.

524
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,100
Keep trying.

525
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,900
Com.

526
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,200
Archer Lima 2. Archer Lima 2.

527
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,100
This is Dagger team 1, over.

528
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm good. I'm good.

529
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,930
Can they get in that way?

530
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,930
You all right?

531
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger team 1.

532
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,230
Do you copy? Over.

533
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,900
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger team 1. Do you copy? Over.

534
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,260
How you doing? You're bleeding.

535
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Okay.

536
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,330
You hit your head.

537
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
You hit your head.

538
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Did you black out?

539
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,900
Yeah, I guess so.

540
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,930
Major.

541
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,300
- She hit her head pretty bad. - Let me see.

542
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,630
Pupils are huge.

543
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,660
Sir, I'm sending but they're not receiving.

544
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,660
I'm hearing a click back as soon as I sign over, but no answer.

545
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,600
Keep trying.

546
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,600
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

547
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,700
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger team 1. Do you copy? Over.

548
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,830
... over there.

549
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,960
Where's everyone else? Where's the rest of Utah?

550
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm Sergeant Chen. I was with Utah.

551
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,360
We were the second team in last night. There was eight of us.

552
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,150
Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?

553
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,830
Well, I can tell you this much.

554
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,160
Sergeant Comstock's not gonna be on your team Christmas card this year.

555
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,260
- You saw insurgents kill Comstock? - Insurgents?

556
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,730
Is this guy for real?

557
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,130
- What rock were you under? - I was the radio operator.

558
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,030
We lost com. I was stuck in the truck the whole night.

559
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,830
- I never saw the active camouflage. - Active camouflage?

560
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,230
Even if there was a such thing, and there's not...

561
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,760
How does a human wearing active camouflage walk through walls?

562
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,260
Or through three mags of armor-piercing ammo?

563
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,730
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

564
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,060
This thing's killed at least 19 of our men.

565
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,600
And we have no idea what it is.

566
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Clyne.

567
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
You saw it.

568
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,730
What was it?

569
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,230
Human.

570
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,930
Had a human form.

571
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,160
It looked at me, it was conscious.

572
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,230
Like a person.

573
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,760
Is there anything that explains what you saw?

574
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,030
No.

575
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's pull together all the functional goggles that we have.

576
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,140
My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.

577
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,160
Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

578
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,730
Forget the goggles. We can't recharge them anyway.

579
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,360
So, what do we do?

580
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
How are we supposed to see them?

581
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,930
Maybe that camera can still help us.

582
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,180
If we get to an elevated position,

583
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,730
we'd have a better vantage point.

584
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Help me with this?

585
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

586
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,630
They're everywhere.

587
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,030
Something's stopping them.

588
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,930
Some sort of black sand.

589
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,330
I fell in that sand.

590
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,930
- I had to... pick it out of my hand. - Let me see it.

591
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,700
- Little, sharp pieces of metal. - They're iron filings.

592
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,630
- It's pure iron. - Yeah.

593
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,660
And there's a trail of it... All the way around the building.

594
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,360
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

595
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,860
I don't think we're alone.

596
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,230
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

597
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Point and shoot?

598
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,760
Point and shoot.

599
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,330
Breach! Breach!

600
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,700
- I've got kids. - Clear.

601
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,030
- Clear. - All clear.

602
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
Tell them to take the long wall.

603
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,760
Ask them where they got this, and who else is here.

604
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,480
Ask them if there's anyone

605
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,730
else in the factory, and do they have guns.

606
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,200
She says they're here alone.

607
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,900
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

608
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
- No one at all. - Major sessions.

609
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,930
What's the problem?

610
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,700
This factory has its own transmission tower.

611
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,130
It puts out a huge signal.

612
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,030
So, what's the problem?

613
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,600
Everyone within 20 miles

614
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,200
will hear our conversation with base.

615
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,300
Any insurgent radio will pick up our transmission.

616
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,700
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

617
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,960
Connect me to General Orland as soon as possible.

618
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,490
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger team.

619
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,630
Do you copy?

620
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,190
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2, this is dagger team.

621
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,930
Do you copy?

622
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,490
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2, this is dagger team.

623
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,630
Do you copy?

624
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,180
You guys are our new recruits.

625
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,700
And believe me... we could use the help.

626
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

627
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,630
Hey, I need to ask you something.

628
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,860
Was it your idea... to put the barrier... outside?

629
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,030
Their father. Their father knew.

630
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,390
Their father rolled open barrels of the iron shavings

631
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,200
around the building.

632
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,330
He saved their lives.

633
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,360
What happened to your father?

634
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,160
You're a little scrapper, aren't you?

635
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,260
Hey, buddy, you all right? Come on, get up.

636
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
What are you doing?

637
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Are you a ghost?

638
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,000
Aratare.

639
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,210
He says, "Don't say that word."

640
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,830
Ask him what they are.

641
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Lost souls.

642
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,060
Souls of the dead.

643
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,650
They're trapped between life and death,

644
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,230
and they can't find peace.

645
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,300
How's that happen?

646
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,860
He says, "War."

647
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Come on.

648
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,930
If their father was the one who put down the iron shavings,

649
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,260
he knows more about these things than any of us do.

650
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,700
Ask her where her father is.

651
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,330
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

652
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
He thinks he went to get help.

653
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,330
He died outside, when he was making the barrier.

654
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,700
She had to bring him in here.

655
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
I'm so sorry.

656
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,760
- Okay? - Yeah.

657
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,060
Ceramic tile.

658
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,690
Ask her how her father knew

659
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,860
about the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

660
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,500
What else did he know about them?

661
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,760
She doesn't know.

662
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
"Masarov."

663
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,900
- What is Masarov? - It's a place.

664
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,330
It's a district up the river.

665
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
It's where it all began.

666
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,630
It's where the Aratare killings started.

667
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
Aratare.

668
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,130
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

669
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,930
Extract us from this roof and get us the hell out of here.

670
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
There are phone lines and power lines everywhere.

671
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,760
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

672
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,960
Easy pickings for a teenager with a shoulder rocket.

673
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,750
Major, can you get me up to speed?

674
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,760
You spoke with base?

675
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,730
Yeah. The General's sending in helos to come get us,

676
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,330
and tanks to secure the landing zone in an open plaza

677
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,670
about half a mile from here, at dawn.

678
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,300
That's a long way on foot.

679
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,900
You think we can make it a half mile? With kids?

680
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,340
We don't have an option. Okay?

681
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,260
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

682
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,330
And since we used signal tower to talk to base,

683
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,840
everyone knows where we are.

684
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,860
We gotta move out.

685
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:01,920
So you wanna go running around out there

686
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,160
with those things roaming the streets?

687
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,130
Even though we have no way to see or fight?

688
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,400
Better than waiting for them to find a way in here.

689
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,900
How is it better?

690
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
The only reason we're still alive is that barricade out there.

691
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,910
Look, eventually they're gonna get through.

692
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,230
It's just a matter of time.

693
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,760
- Wait, wait, wait. - We have to take our chances.

694
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,930
- This is the best plan that we have. - Major.

695
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,600
What if I told you I can improve our chances of making that plaza?

696
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,660
- I'm listening. - Take a look around you.

697
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,860
Everything in this building... is filled with these.

698
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,730
Iron dust.

699
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,600
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

700
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,700
Exactly. Weaponize it.

701
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
- Dirty bombs. - Best idea I've heard all night.

702
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,360
Let's collect the grenades.

703
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,230
Clyne.

704
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,330
I need you to be our eyes out there.

705
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,520
Can you haul that camera on foot?

706
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,160
I've got a better idea.

707
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,300
This camera already projects the right wavelength of UV light.

708
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,700
If I can turn it inside out,

709
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,260
by reversing the polarity of some of the components,

710
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,330
I might be able to turn it from a camera into a searchlight.

711
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
We'll be able to see them with our own eyes.

712
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,250
That'd be a game-changer.

713
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,830
Think I can talk to the convoy?

714
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,080
I might be albe to tell them

715
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,260
how to do the same with their equipment.

716
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,860
When they come get us, they're gonna need eyes, too.

717
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,760
I'll connect you to the main engineer back at base.

718
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,160
Copy that.

719
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,900
They're ready to equip their vehicles with whatever you need.

720
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,800
Can you repeat the whole request back to me, please?

721
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,330
Okay, yes. That's correct.

722
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,810
But what you gonna need is a device

723
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,960
that emits a very short wavelength of light.

724
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,230
I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.

725
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,000
Do you have anything you can mount on a tank?

726
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,760
We got movement across the alleyway.

727
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
Guys, we got movement. Can we get eyes on it?

728
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,200
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

729
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,620
What's the word on the convoy?

730
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,200
Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

731
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,000
They're on their way to the extraction point.

732
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,000
Here they come! Get your gear.

733
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,160
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

734
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,800
Okay, come on. Let's go.

735
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,660
That was the fastest way to the extraction point.

736
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,260
Hey. She says she can show us another way.

737
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,910
Talbot, you're with Clyne.

738
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,130
Diaz, you're on point.

739
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,800
Let's go.

740
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,100
Yup. Moving.

741
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Okay, let's go.

742
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,360
Come on.

743
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Come here.

744
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,830
Everybody's accounted for.

745
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,660
- It looks clear. - Let's move. Come here.

746
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:59,860
Okay. She says, "Go right here."

747
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,860
Hey. Heads up, 6 o'clock.

748
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,600
- Move! - Move!

749
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,730
Move!

750
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,200
They're coming.

751
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Come on.

752
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,830
Come on.

753
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,660
Watch out!

754
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,260
Oh, shit.

755
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,950
Come on, Lewis! Let's go!

756
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,060
I think it's working!

757
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,730
- In here! - This way.

758
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,360
Move, move.

759
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
Go!

760
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,100
Go!

761
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,630
- Move it! - Come on.

762
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,230
- Pick up! - Get up.

763
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,130
- I'm good. - Go! Go!

764
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,600
Steady your gun!

765
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,660
- Get down! - Take cover, man.

766
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,000
Come on, Doctor. Come on.

767
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,030
Incoming!

768
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,100
I got a man down! Man down!

769
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,130
Run!

770
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,330
- Moving it up! - More on that side!

771
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,130
Hurry.

772
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,760
She says, "Straight ahead, under the archway."

773
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,730
Watch yourself.

774
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,340
- Hold it. - She says this is the place.

775
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,030
Go, go.

776
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,230
Looks clear.

777
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,930
- Where are they? - Get on the bus. Go.

778
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,330
Where's the rescue?

779
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,700
Where's the light?

780
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,130
Come on. Come on, come on. Work. Work. Work.

781
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,660
Come on. It's okay.

782
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,300
You sure this is the place?

783
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,160
- Yeah. - Ask them if they're sure.

784
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,160
She said, "I'm pretty sure."

785
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,100
Major.

786
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,160
This thing is dead. We can't see them.

787
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,660
We're blind.

788
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,600
- That's us. - This is the landing zone.

789
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,260
- Commander, are you seeing this? - Those are the targets.

790
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,330
- Go! Go! Go! - Go!

791
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,860
- Go, go, go. - Let's go.

792
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,060
Move. Go on.

793
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,760
On the ground.

794
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,330
Fire.

795
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,230
Get down!

796
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,200
- Move on my command. - Move it out!

797
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,930
Overhead!

798
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,660
Let's get to the tanks! Move it to the tanks!

799
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,970
- Move it! - Move!

800
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Move!

801
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,900
- Open fire! - Let it go!

802
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,130
- Get back! - No.

803
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,360
Get back!

804
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:58,960
Left flank!

805
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,200
Your six!

806
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,760
- Where are they? - I don't know!

807
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,430
- Where's Bogdan? - Where'd he go?

808
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,030
- Who's got him? - Do you see them?

809
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,760
We'll find you!

810
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,130
- Bogdan! - Bogdan!

811
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,360
Get him!

812
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,130
Bogdan! Bogdan!

813
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,100
- Bogdan! - Get back here!

814
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,330
Get back here!

815
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,630
- Come on! - Come on.

816
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,760
- Take her. - Get up.

817
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,160
Help her! Save her!

818
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,330
I got her.

819
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,830
Let's go.

820
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,030
Come on!

821
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,200
- Get up. Come on. - Dr. Clyne, come on!

822
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,930
- Get in! - Okay.

823
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,900
Major. General Orland.

824
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,300
General, go for sessions.

825
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,760
Base has been lost!

826
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,940
We're sending you to our refugee bunker!

827
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,200
Yes, sir.

828
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,160
Hey, where are we going? Base is that way.

829
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,760
- We're not going to base. - Why not?

830
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,230
It's been compromised.

831
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,300
Hey, they're spreading through the streets.

832
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,760
They're everywhere.

833
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,160
They just gonna leave us here?

834
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,660
There's more people to airlift.

835
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,960
- What is this place? - Entrance is over here.

836
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,830
Open the door! Open the door!

837
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,960
Get back!

838
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,600
Put your weapons down.

839
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,860
Put your weapons down! Do it now!

840
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,060
He's saying, "Safe inside."

841
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,060
Okay. It's okay.

842
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:03,760
Stay close.

843
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,960
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

844
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,000
She's not okay. Come here.

845
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,330
I'm gonna need some room. It's okay. It's okay.

846
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,860
What the hell happened to base?

847
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,000
Base got overrun.

848
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,600
The general is meeting us here.

849
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,760
So, what is this place?

850
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,300
We're in a civilian refugee shelter.

851
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,000
This bunker has 20 feet of concrete and steel.

852
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,930
Are we safe here? I have no idea. But there's food and water.

853
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,300
Talbot, gather what you can.

854
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,060
Toll, chen, head back to the entrance.

855
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,130
There's a com center. See who you can reach.

856
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,900
Alessio, you're with me. Let's go.

857
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,200
- There. - Where?

858
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,760
- There. - Right over there.

859
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:51,870
- Okay. - On the bed.

860
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:53,930
You're okay. Shh. You're gonna be okay.

861
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,060
- What happened? - It's her shoulder.

862
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,700
- Her shoulder has shrapnel in it.

863
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,260
- We're gonna cut open her sleeve.

864
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,030
Get the IV line ready.

865
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,930
This is yours.

866
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,230
Now, I need your help, Sari, to stop the aratare.

867
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,600
I need to know what your father knew.

868
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,260
What did your father do?

869
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,130
He worked with ceramics.

870
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,130
What did he make?

871
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,300
He made containers.

872
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,360
He made containers for Masarov.

873
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:45,330
The power plant where the aratare came from.

874
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,310
Let's get the mask on her.

875
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,360
Okay, we have to take her now.

876
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,330
- This is the U.S. armed forces! - Open it.

877
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,800
Lower your weapons.

878
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,960
- How many are you? - Not many.

879
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,600
Let's give them a hand.

880
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,960
Let's go.

881
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,700
Bring as much as you can.

882
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,160
The base was overrun.

883
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,760
It was like a wave.

884
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,060
Invisible.

885
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,730
Men just started falling.

886
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,800
Our conventional weapons were useless.

887
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,660
I requested an order to evacuate the base...

888
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,100
But our long-range come are completely scrambled.

889
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,900
So, I took all the gear I could.

890
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,030
I started sending units north out of the area of operation.

891
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,930
Kept five aircraft with the least amount of fuel,

892
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,360
stayed behind with one platoon.

893
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,330
Out of the 240 of us, we have 19 remaining.

894
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,960
Did you get a message to higher command?

895
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
No.

896
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,010
Is there a rescue mission planned?

897
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,630
No. We intercepted radio chatter

898
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,800
from Moldovan friendlies to find this place.

899
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,160
We sent that bird to pick you up and bring you here.

900
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,700
If you'd even tried to return to base, you'd be dead.

901
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,200
We're the last U.S. Forces in the country?

902
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
I hope so.

903
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,660
So, what's the plan, sir?

904
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,600
Came here to regroup, Major.

905
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,330
There's no plan.

906
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,800
- I recommend we fortify the entrance. - Fortify with what?

907
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,700
- We wait till a rescue mission... - Fortify with what?

908
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,660
They'll come through whatever you use.

909
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,810
We need to take our chances get on one of our helos...

910
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,600
Twenty minutes of flight time!

911
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,560
There's twenty minutes of flight time in those birds.

912
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,560
Not more!

913
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
Doesn't matter, there's not enough room for all of us...

914
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,350
We need to form teams and take the aircraft.

915
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,000
But where you gonna go, Major?

916
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,600
You can't run from them.

917
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,060
You can't stop them. Your weapons are useless.

918
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,100
We have no idea what they are!

919
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,160
If they come through that door, we're sitting ducks.

920
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,230
We can't stop them! We can't stop them!

921
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,230
Take what we can and go.

922
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:58,830
I know what they are.

923
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,130
I know what they are.

924
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,060
I know what they are.

925
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,360
We think we're seeing things.

926
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,000
We think it can't be real, but it kills.

927
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:15,800
So, it is real.

928
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
It's something.

929
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,490
It's not light, it's not shadow,

930
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:21,900
or some trick of the mind. Pass through walls, check.

931
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,960
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

932
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,700
Kills to the touch, check.

933
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,800
Comstock. He was under a ceramic bathtub, is that right?

934
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:36,480
Tank armor. It couldn't pass through tank armor.

935
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,360
M1 Abrams tank armor, that's ceramic plating everywhere.

936
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,640
It cannot pass through ceramic.

937
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,760
You know what that means?

938
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,200
It means this stuff isn't natural.

939
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
Someone made it.

940
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:50,630
It's man-made.

941
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,000
Man-made how?

942
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,850
Okay. You have solid, liquid, gas.

943
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,930
Lava can turn into rock.

944
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,110
Ice can turn into water.

945
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:02,060
Metals can melt. These are natural states.

946
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,570
But there are unnatural states.

947
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,200
Artificial states, man-made states.

948
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,760
Condensate.

949
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,100
Bose-Einstein condensate.

950
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,950
A state of matter that was

951
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,930
predicted by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

952
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,860
It has some very unusual properties.

953
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,830
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

954
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,030
It cannot pass through ceramic, but it can pass through walls.

955
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
It's so cold it will kill you instantly on contact.

956
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,700
It can do everything we've been seeing here.

957
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,550
You want to create Bose-Einstein condensate.

958
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:29,330
You need power, and you need a lot of it.

959
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
Masarov. The power plant.

960
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,230
Yes, Masarov. Where they were made.

961
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,300
You said this country was pouring billions into weapons research.

962
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,060
This is a weapon.

963
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,320
And it was set loose, or it broke loose.

964
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,030
All right, but these things climb.

965
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
They're like human beings. It looks like a person.

966
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,200
So can marble and clay in the right hands.

967
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,330
And I wanna know why.

968
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,780
Why they look like people.

969
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,330
I can't tell you how they did this.

970
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,630
What I can tell you... is that someone made them.

971
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,340
If someone made them,

972
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,640
they don't escape the laws of the world.

973
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,700
Nothing does.

974
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,800
It shines light on new laws, and that's what we have to learn.

975
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,680
Cause they have order and structure.

976
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,000
They can be broken down.

977
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,820
Anything can be broken down. It's just energy.

978
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,300
And cause I know what they are,

979
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,280
I know the properties, I can build the right weapons.

980
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,330
What kind of weapons look like?

981
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,690
Plasmic-discharge weapons. They can tear apart the condensate.

982
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,650
Where do you expect that we can find weapons like that?

983
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,130
We're not gonna find them, we're gonna build them.

984
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,920
Build them with what?

985
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,100
Anything we can find in this bunker.

986
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,700
Anything with electronics, optics, ballistic casings.

987
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,660
All the gear you brought from base.

988
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:28,230
We can take it all apart, and I can build an arsenal.

989
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,000
And then we can go to Masarov

990
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,900
and we can stop this before it goes any further.

991
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,140
Because if we don't,

992
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,630
the condensate which feed on all the energy in its path

993
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,580
will grow exponentially.

994
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
There's no limit to how far they can spread,

995
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,660
unless we stop them.

996
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,630
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

997
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,830
Let's move!

998
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,260
Same number each side.

999
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,830
All right, let's go, boys!

1000
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,000
Any med patches in there?

1001
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,800
We got three of them over here.

1002
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,790
It's a ground-to-air tracking scope.

1003
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:31,660
We can use this. They have good optics.

1004
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
- Good. This is good. - Two more over there.

1005
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,760
See that 305?

1006
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,680
Half of these are labeled "Defective."

1007
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,190
We're gonna need a voltage counter.

1008
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,600
I want you to start testing these.

1009
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,230
All right, open it up.

1010
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,760
Get that one open. Pop it.

1011
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,230
Is that what I think it is?

1012
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,930
We got the Lotus from base.

1013
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's badass.

1014
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,130
- Looks like a mechanical rottweiler. - Look at that.

1015
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,060
Clyne's making a few changes.

1016
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:07,060
They're taking down a chain hoist and putting up a searchlight.

1017
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,960
Déjà vu.

1018
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,000
- What does it fire? - It's a focused energy pulse.

1019
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:20,030
If my math is right...

1020
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,960
it should break down condensate.

1021
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,570
Masarov.

1022
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,030
The single largest power plant in the region.

1023
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,250
It's where the killings started.

1024
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,200
If they're man-made, they were made here.

1025
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,060
It's less than ten klicks from here.

1026
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:47,360
Our birds can make that, but... it's probably one way.

1027
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,150
I've been digging for clues with the civilians here.

1028
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,830
I found this intel on Masarov.

1029
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,160
It's been retrofitted several times over the last decade

1030
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,660
by the central regime.

1031
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,280
It's got "Weapons research" written all over it.

1032
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,020
Okay, you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate.

1033
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,680
It's gonna be up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this.

1034
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
We have to create a diversion.

1035
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,710
We'll draw them out here so you can infiltrate the structure

1036
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,000
and try to find the source.

1037
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,110
Clyne's predicting the charge from these weapons will be extremely hot.

1038
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,960
Enough to destroy condensate.

1039
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,240
We'll find out soon enough.

1040
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:28,830
All right, boys.

1041
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,730
This is it.

1042
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,760
If you have any last words...

1043
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,630
now's the time.

1044
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,230
All right, listen up.

1045
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,120
You are using untested weapons...

1046
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,860
against an enemy that, to this point, has been unstoppable.

1047
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,620
Now, you are heading into unknown territory.

1048
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:17,340
And hear me when I say

1049
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,300
you're gonna see things you will not understand.

1050
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,940
Our enemy has spread through the city in a matter of days.

1051
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,820
There's no telling how far they will spread...

1052
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,680
unless we fight back.

1053
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:34,160
Most men never even come close... to changing the future.

1054
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,360
This is the place.

1055
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,030
And now is the time.

1056
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,900
Make no mistake, you're the last line of defense.

1057
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,830
Let's go do what we came here to do.

1058
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,160
Let's go, let's go!

1059
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,900
One minute.

1060
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,160
Thirty seconds.

1061
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,830
Spearhead 1, proceed with descent.

1062
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,360
All right, let's go.

1063
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,100
Here we go.

1064
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
Let's move!

1065
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,660
We have a visual.

1066
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,760
Hostile target gathering at 12 o'clock on east end of platform.

1067
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,660
Move, move!

1068
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,960
We are a go.

1069
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,060
I have a confirmed spectral kill.

1070
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,760
We're a go. I say again, all units go.

1071
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:37,330
- Let's show them what we've got. - Come on.

1072
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,760
- This is it! - Let's do it!

1073
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:39,930
Let's go. Drop.

1074
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,760
Copy, Spearhead 1. All units engage.

1075
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,380
Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula.

1076
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,660
Spearhead 3 beginning descent over south peninsula.

1077
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,660
At least a dozen targets coming out.

1078
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,000
- Go! Go! - Let's move!

1079
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,900
- On me! - All units, you are clear to engage.

1080
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:01,130
- Move in! - Move it!

1081
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:04,800
Lock and load.

1082
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,140
- Move out. - Let's move.

1083
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,730
Right behind you!

1084
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,520
Weapons free! Weapons free!

1085
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,160
Let's go. Move up!

1086
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,230
- Move! - Come on!

1087
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,730
- I said go, go, go! - Move!

1088
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,060
Spearhead 2, you're go for infield. Proceed to insertion point.

1089
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,130
Go, go, go!

1090
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,900
Get down!

1091
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
Right there.

1092
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:57,300
- Toll! - Go! Go!

1093
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,930
Go, go, go!

1094
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,600
Go, go, go!

1095
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,000
- Somebody get on top! - Down right there!

1096
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,360
- We got more incoming! - Keep formation!

1097
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,630
Let's move it!

1098
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,260
Fight! Fight!

1099
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Move!

1100
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,060
- Let's go, go, go! - Go, John!

1101
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,830
- Do we have a sit-rep? - Right now.

1102
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,600
Clyne, what's the situation down there?

1103
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,730
Sessions, we got split up.

1104
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,820
We're still looking for the lab.

1105
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,600
We're holding. Don't know how long.

1106
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,830
- Do you copy? - Can you hear me? Sessions?

1107
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260
We gotta keep going.

1108
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,060
We gotta be close now.

1109
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,060
God.

1110
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,900
Look over here.

1111
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,660
Bose-Einstein condensate.

1112
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,200
Look at these x-rays.

1113
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,330
They were scanning people. On a molecular level.

1114
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,800
And printing them out of condensate.

1115
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,030
It's an assembly line.

1116
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,260
Like some kind of...

1117
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,000
Industrial process.

1118
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,760
You're right.

1119
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,800
It's a weapon.

1120
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,130
What happened here?

1121
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:22,100
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

1122
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,630
Half the cells are broken and empty.

1123
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,060
Some structural failure must have set them free.

1124
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,600
Opened up pandora's box.

1125
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,730
Now what?

1126
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
Incoming!

1127
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,760
Hey, 12 o'clock!

1128
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,930
- Do it! - It's up! They're coming back together!

1129
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
- They're moving! - All eyes on target.

1130
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,760
- One of them is reforming. - Bring it down!

1131
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,130
"Top research advisers of the central regime."

1132
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,360
This man was trying to stop it. They did lose control.

1133
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,630
Can you translate this?

1134
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,010
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.

1135
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,630
Half these words I've never seen.

1136
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,860
What about the other half?

1137
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,000
"Decouple... decouple procedure.

1138
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,220
Disconnect the umbilicals to,

1139
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,200
uh... interrupt the... neural activity."

1140
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,660
- Okay. - So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

1141
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,120
And then you gotta pull

1142
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,200
this bracket here to release all the cables.

1143
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,000
And then?

1144
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,900
That should stop them.

1145
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,260
Take this.

1146
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,330
Come on! Get up!

1147
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,200
Right there! There's more!

1148
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,600
Another one!

1149
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,300
Got it right there!

1150
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,730
- Clyne! - I know!

1151
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,660
What the hell?

1152
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,200
I did them all. Nothing's happening.

1153
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:02,900
Clyne! Pull the bracket! In the middle!

1154
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,930
- No! - No!

1155
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:46,060
- Is it over? - I don't know.

1156
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,300
Can you walk?

1157
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,630
- I'm all right. - Come on.

1158
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,700
We have to find a way out.

1159
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,330
- Do you hear that? - Yeah.

1160
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
This is it.

1161
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,600
They weren't just scanning people.

1162
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,030
They're not just printouts.

1163
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,900
This is what's controlling them.

1164
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,330
These are from real corpses.

1165
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,630
Each one is made from a real person.

1166
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,700
They're alive?

1167
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:19,830
They're not alive.

1168
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
They're not dead.

1169
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,700
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

1170
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,360
But they are in pain.

1171
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
How do you know?

1172
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,630
This is pain.

1173
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,260
But how do you know they can feel?

1174
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:46,860
I can't prove it.

1175
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,700
I can't.

1176
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,030
So, maybe there are things science can't answer.

1177
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,630
No.

1178
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,100
Wait, no.

1179
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,160
This is why we came here.

1180
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,100
This is the evidence. This is why you came, remember?

1181
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,830
Remember? So many people have died. You said it.

1182
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,230
- You said, "I wanna know why." - I know enough.

1183
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,960
You have to think about the bigger picture.

1184
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:35,900
I am.

1185
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,700
Help them off single file.

1186
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:33,940
Got more coming in!

1187
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:36,230
Put them in unit 5.

1188
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,320
- Over here. Over here. - Watch his neck.

1189
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1190
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,670
Give me your hand.

1191
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:57,130
Right there, sir.

1192
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:58,960
Welcome back.

1193
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,300
You okay?

1194
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:38,630
New survey teams.

1195
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,760
They're gonna take Masarov apart piece by piece.

1196
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,700
Measure everything.

1197
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,930
Try to reverse-engineer it.

1198
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:48,960
Fight over ownership.

1199
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,680
I've been asked if you wanna

1200
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,760
go back out there. I said I'd ask, but...

1201
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:56,100
I've seen what I came to see.

1202
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:15,630
They don't stop, do they?

1203
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:17,900
I don't think they know how.

1204
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,300
I told you you'd go home to Virginia without unpacking.

1205
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,700
Delta unit, move out.

1206
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,800
Thank you.
