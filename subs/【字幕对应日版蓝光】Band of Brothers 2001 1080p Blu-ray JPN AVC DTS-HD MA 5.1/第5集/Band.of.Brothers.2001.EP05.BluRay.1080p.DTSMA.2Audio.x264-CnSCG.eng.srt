1
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,690
If you're a leader, you lead the way.

2
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,660
Not just on the easy ones.

3
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,490
You take the tough ones, too.

4
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,960
A good leader has to understand...

5
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,270
...the people that are under him, understand their needs...

6
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,370
...their desires or how they think a little bit.

7
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,740
It seemed like he always made the right decisions along the way.

8
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,710
He was a real soldier.

9
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,980
Like, some of the officers...

10
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,280
...I don't think I'd follow them into water.

11
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,420
But he was one of the best.

12
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,360
He went right in there and he didn't know.

13
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,400
He never thought of not being first...

14
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,990
...or sending somebody in his place.

15
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,100
I don't know how he survived.

16
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,140
But he did.

17
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,470
Lew?

18
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,090
Wake up. They want us back at regiment.

19
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,860
Come on, Nix, get up. Let's go.

20
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,100
Come on, something's up. Strayer's orders.

21
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,700
Okay, I'll be right down.

22
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,340
- Let's go, come on, you got 10 minutes. - Go away.

23
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,170
Come on, big guy, let's go.

24
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,810
- Leave me alone. - Okay.

25
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,180
- Come on. - Goddamn it.

26
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,480
That's my own piss, for Christ's sake.

27
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,130
Son of a bitch.

28
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,660
We're the only unit in the group that's got the Germans on the German side of the Rhine.

29
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,410
If we'd have taken Antwerp and I'm not saying that would be easy...

30
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,410
...we'd be over the river, well supplied, and have the Krauts on their heels.

31
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,140
Now, if I can just get lke on the phone... Are you listening to me?

32
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,850
Hangin' on every word.

33
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,740
Hey, Moose, you too?

34
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,780
Yeah, whatever's going on, Sink is not happy.

35
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,353
Nixon, Heyliger. Meet Col. Dobie, British 1st Airborne.

36
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,720
Capt. Nixon is our 2nd Battalion S-2. That's First Lt. Moose Heyliger.

37
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,520
It appears the British lost 8,000 men when Market Garden fell on its ass...

38
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,090
...which is why Col. Dobie has been tasked with coordinating a rescue operation...

39
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,330
...for the Red Devils trapped when Arnhem fell.

40
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Dutch resistance are harboring 140 of my chaps here just outside a Jerry-held town 15 miles north of the river.

41
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,910
They'll go to the riverbank and gather in the woods tonight.

42
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,140
Pick a team and get them back across the Rhine as fast as possible.

43
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,470
140 men?

44
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,670
Canadian engineers have supplied six boats.

45
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,880
The rendezvous point is isolated and landable.

46
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,720
I swam it myself last night. At approximately 0030 hours...

47
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,120
...they will signal the "V" for victory with a handheld red torch.

48
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,320
That would be a handheld red flashlight.

49
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,020
We'll call this Operation Pegasus.

50
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,460
Bob, your 2nd Battalion is on the spot. Get it Done.

51
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,330
Capt. Nixon, assist Col. Dobie in every way possible.

52
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,630
If you need anything at all, you come to me.

53
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,070
- I can hardly ask for more. - Capt. Winters.

54
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,160
You haven't endorsed the Market Garden after-action report...

55
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,970
...or the updated Battalion TO and E. Why is that?

56
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll have them at CP at 1300, sir.

57
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,060
I want an inventory on any material the British 43rd left behind:

58
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,580
Rations, medical supplies, transport.

59
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,550
- An inventory. Yes, sir. - Dick.

60
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm still waiting to write citations on that 5 October operation.

61
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,250
- I need your report. - The report. Yes, sir.

62
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,380
- Light a fire under it, Dick. - Sir.

63
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,860
Now, goddamn it, we asked for this yesterday...

64
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,300
...and here it is today, a day late and a dollar short.

65
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,670
Enemy disposition and maps in the S-2. We should have a look at that.

66
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,340
You say there's about 100 of 'em?

67
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,470
This is it, boys.

68
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,980
Get across the river, across the field and over the dike.

69
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,110
That's a lot of territory to cover. Where you want us to go?

70
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,250
You, Hashey, you get the penthouse.

71
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,890
Thank you. We're up top.

72
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,220
- How bad does it get? - You'll find out.

73
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,930
- That's a lot of territory to cover. - A couple of regular GI Joe's?

74
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,060
You said it. Come on.

75
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,070
New guys giving the replacements the what-for, and why-is.

76
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,110
I swear one of them's never shaved.

77
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,380
- Yeah, kids. - This is a hell of a dog, Tab.

78
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,180
Thank you, there you go.

79
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,310
- What'd you call it, Tab? - Trigger.

80
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,890
That's good. I like that. Trigger.

81
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,650
Got anything on this?

82
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,090
- No, it's all quiet. - We've got penetration!

83
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,430
- Alley's hurt, get the doc. - Get him on the table.

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,960
Yeah, it's Alley.

85
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,170
- All right, I got this. - Alley, you're gonna be okay.

86
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,800
- Boyle, get Doc Roe. - Where am I?

87
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,670
- Something happened - What happened? - Where was it?

88
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,680
Crossroads, where the road crosses the dike.

89
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,140
They knew we was there because of your loud mouth.

90
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,240
Joe, back off.

91
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,250
Lesniewski, send a runner for Lt. Welsh.

92
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,150
- Assemble me a squad. - Yes, sir. 1st Squad, on your feet!

93
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,020
- Weapons and ammo only! - Give me room.

94
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,710
Let's move! Let's go!

95
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,510
Boyle, get the boots off, elevate the leg.

96
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,330
Liebgott, use the sulfur.

97
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,360
Let's get this done quickly, we got to move.

98
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,590
Not too much.

99
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,760
Alley.

100
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,000
- MG-42? - Yeah.

101
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,870
What the hell are they shootin' at?

102
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,040
- What's down that road? - Regimental headquarters.

103
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,940
But that's three miles away. Why are they giving away their position?

104
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,850
They ain't as smart as me and you?

105
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,750
I'll check it out anyway. Hold here, wait for my signal.

106
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,250
Yes, sir.

107
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,060
Holding here, I'm waitin' for a signal.

108
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,810
This is our fallback position, here.

109
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,720
Mortars, deploy here. 1st Squad, on me.

110
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,550
Go.

111
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Second on the right.

112
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,590
First on the right.

113
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,530
Third on the right. Nail the machine gun.

114
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,070
Second on the left, first on the left.

115
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,830
Wait for my signal.

116
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,900
Prepare to fire.

117
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,610
Two rounds, AG, quick.

118
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,770
- Fall back! - Fire.

119
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,650
Fire.

120
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,630
Higgins! Handful of Krauts, based on the dike, 12:00!

121
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,800
- How many Krauts are left up there? - I don't know.

122
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,200
But we got seven in one blow.

123
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,580
Bring on Boyle and Perconte, go!

124
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,640
Come on, fall back.

125
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,750
Suppressing fire.

126
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,160
Suppressing fire!

127
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,810
Hashey, Garcia, follow me.

128
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,990
Harry, tell Peacock to bring up the balance of 1st Platoon on the double!

129
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,060
And another machine-gun squad, over.

130
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,970
Dukeman!

131
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,700
Go get that machine gun on the right flank, go!

132
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,570
Christenson!

133
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,580
Fuck, Dukeman's down.

134
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,860
Sir, the balance of 1st Platoon are here.

135
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,260
Gordon and More brought another 30 cal.

136
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,840
Sir.

137
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,510
They're behind a solid roadway embankment.

138
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,710
We're in a ditch. They can outflank us along the dike...

139
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,340
...and catch us out here as soon as they figure that out.

140
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,850
So, how many Krauts are we talking about?

141
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,750
There's a ferry crossing here...

142
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,280
...so, it could be a whole battalion, as far as I know.

143
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,190
Okay, what are your orders?

144
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,530
We got no choice.

145
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,170
Here it is. Talbert, you'll take ten men along the dike.

146
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,070
Peacock, you'll take ten men along the left flank.

147
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,410
I'll take ten up the middle, so follow me.

148
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,510
Questions? Go!

149
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,280
Enter.

150
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,640
I don't know why I'm still doing this.

151
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,040
What, drinking?

152
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,550
No, hiding it in your footlocker.

153
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm a captain, for Christ's sake.

154
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,790
Why don't you...

155
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,330
Why don't you just give it up?

156
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,450
Drinking?

157
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,270
No, hiding it in my footlocker.

158
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,860
You're a captain, for Pete's sake.

159
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,340
Maybe you're right and this is the perfect place to stop drinking.

160
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,740
Right here on the business end of the Allied advance.

161
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,480
Cheers.

162
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,800
Dick, you know, that's not literature. You just keep it simple.

163
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,500
Try writing it in the first person plural, you know.

164
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,540
- Say "we" a lot. - Thanks for the tip.

165
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,540
Fix bayonets.

166
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,050
Go on the red smoke.

167
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,250
No, wait! Wait for the signal.

168
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,690
Jesus.

169
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,290
Move on,brothers

170
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,860
Come on, boys!

171
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,530
Four.

172
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,200
Five.

173
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,270
Holy shit!

174
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,610
- It's a whole other company! - No shit!

175
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,820
Fire, fire, fire.

176
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,790
Easy Beaver to Easy Minor. Reinforce Easy at phase one yellow.

177
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,990
Plus one, strike three. Fire concentration Charlie.

178
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,090
Dropped 200, left 100.

179
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,470
Repeat, plus one, strike three.

180
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,170
Fire concentration Charlie. Dropped 200, left 100.

181
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,080
Krauts in the open, fire for effect, over.

182
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,580
Heraus, Hande hoch. Schnell, schnell!

183
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,280
- What's he saying? - He's telling me that they're Polish.

184
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,520
Don't you believe it. There ain't no Poles in the SS!

185
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,920
Move!

186
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,070
Jesus Christ

187
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,870
Shit!

188
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,380
Luz, send Lightning a contact report. Boyle!

189
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,010
Get up where you can spot the fall of those rounds, go!

190
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,420
Incoming rogues!

191
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,620
Easy Company, take cover!

192
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,460
- Boyle's hit! - Jesus Christ, they got me.

193
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,800
Take cover, it's German artillery.

194
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,470
Get Boyle, he's down, come on, help me.

195
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,830
Jesus, Captain, they're SS.

196
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,880
Joe?

197
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,620
- Joe, knock it off. - Damn it, what?

198
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,720
- You're bleeding. - It's nothing, Captain.

199
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,990
Take these prisoners back to Battalion CP.

200
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,050
- Get yourself cleaned up. - Yes, sir.

201
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,030
Come on, Kraut boys.

202
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,760
- Joe? - Yeah.

203
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,540
- Drop your ammo. - What?

204
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,940
- Drop your ammo. - You kidding? What are you doing?

205
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,130
- Give me your weapon. - Captain.

206
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,010
You have one round. Johnny, how many prisoners do we have?

207
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,310
We got eleven right now, sir. Okay.

208
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,580
You drop a prisoner, the rest'll jump you.

209
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,120
I want all prisoners back at Battalion CP alive.

210
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes, sir.

211
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
"They got me." You believe that?

212
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,130
You believe I said that?

213
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,560
- Can you make it back to CP? - Yeah.

214
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,740
All right, I will see you someplace else.

215
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,970
Take these to Battalion.

216
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,480
- Split 'em up. - Yes, sir.

217
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,760
Up. All right.

218
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,690
Here you are.

219
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,300
We had 'em on the run.

220
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,030
How's that?

221
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,190
The Germans were flooding back towards the ferry crossing when we hit 'em with artillery.

222
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,900
It was like a turkey shoot.

223
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,810
Then they hit us with their 88s, zeroed in on this crossroad.

224
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,610
Now we were lucky, though.

225
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,700
Only 22 wounded.

226
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,370
Lucky?

227
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,280
- Capt. Winters? - He's right down there, sir.

228
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,980
All right, carry on.

229
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,660
All right, Krauts, Hande hoch.

230
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,720
22 wounded? You okay?

231
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,830
- Yeah, one killed. - Who?

232
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,530
Dukeman.

233
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,400
Dukeman.

234
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,510
You're looking at two full companies of SS out there.

235
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,140
About 50 dead, probably another 100 wounded.

236
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,520
Seven back in the regimental cage plus a whole string of 'em up there.

237
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,350
That's not bad for Dukeman.

238
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,260
You got a drink?

239
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,660
Of water?

240
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
Yeah, it's water.

241
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,510
Thanks.

242
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,080
Okay?

243
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,060
363rd Volksgrenadier hit Opheusden early this morning...

244
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,100
...about the same time your SS made a run for my CP down the road.

245
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,080
3rd Battalion got the hell beat out of 'em.

246
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,210
- Holly Horton was killed. - Maj. Horton's dead?

247
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,780
They hit 2nd Battalion CP in force.

248
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,580
He was organizing the defense.

249
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,220
Capt. Nixon, excuse us for just a minute.

250
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,970
How'd you feel about handling the battalion?

251
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,230
Sir?

252
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,740
I'm moving you up to executive officer of 2nd Battalion.

253
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,370
Col. Strayer is... He could use some help.

254
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,920
- I know I could handle them in the field, sir. - That's right, Dick.

255
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,690
You're a solid tactician and a good leader. Don't worry about administration.

256
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,870
Who do you think'll be taking over Easy, sir?

257
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,460
Moose Heyliger can command Easy Company.

258
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,300
Lt. Heyliger would be my choice, sir.

259
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,370
Good.

260
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,410
You pack your gear and come to Battalion CP.

261
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,040
Yes, sir.

262
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,550
Would you like some coffee, sir?

263
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,110
- Yeah, thanks, doc. - All right.

264
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,520
Dick!

265
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,530
Finish your novel yet? That's a lot of homework.

266
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,330
And I thought executive officer was a fun job.

267
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,570
- Who are you? - Zielinski, sir.

268
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,710
- Who is he? - Zielinski, my orderly.

269
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,110
Rank does have its privileges.

270
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,640
Orderly? I suppose you do stuff like get coffee.

271
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,150
- Can do, sir. - Black, no sugar.

272
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,080
And a bacon sandwich. You want something?

273
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,350
Bacon sandwich.

274
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,000
You can give that to Col. Sink with my compliments.

275
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,260
All that for two pages.

276
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
Guess that means that's gonna take a while.

277
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,570
Yeah, it is. You want a job?

278
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,740
There. I think somebody wishes you were back in charge of Easy Company, Moose.

279
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,050
- Are you two just here to gloat? - No, just rub it in a little bit.

280
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,620
Moose is gonna lead his first mission as CO.

281
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,140
Operation Pegasus is set to go off. I wanted to give you the heads up.

282
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,380
Pegasus, yeah.

283
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,980
Yeah, great.

284
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,380
- Everybody know their job? - We've drilled with the boats all day.

285
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,330
Lt. Welsh is coming along, and the Canadian engineers.

286
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,960
Col. Dobie knows his stuff.

287
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,970
Know how many times you'll cross the river?

288
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,270
If there really are 140 Brits in hiding over there, 3 trips.

289
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,030
Speed is the key. What time's jump-off?

290
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,700
We'll be at the far side of the Rhine at 0100.

291
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,540
Speed is the key. Keep moving and lead the way.

292
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,700
Dick.

293
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,540
Easy's in good hands.

294
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,070
Yeah.

295
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,020
- Yeah, right. Well, hang tough. - I could say the same to you.

296
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,250
- Good luck, Moose. - Captain.

297
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,590
- Nix? - Yeah.

298
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,290
- Are we sure on the intelligence of this? - I think it's pretty good.

299
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,560
Is Easy walking into another company of Germans no one can see?

300
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,030
Why don't we ask Moose when he gets back?

301
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,000
Right, yeah.

302
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,810
If they do run into any trouble, you'll let me know?

303
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,640
Yeah.

304
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,780
You run into any bacon sandwich, do the same, all right?

305
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,650
Yeah.

306
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,620
- Line secure, sir. - Fall back into position, Private.

307
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,920
I got the 30 cal on the left flank.

308
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,650
Extend it out to the left, 10 yards.

309
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,990
So, Colonel, where are they?

310
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,560
Leicester. Square.

311
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,100
Come on in.

312
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,770
- Welcome back, sir. - Good to be back.

313
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,030
Heyliger, 506 of the 101st Airborne.

314
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,100
Never thought I'd be so glad to see a bloody Yank.

315
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,340
- Your show, Colonel. - I'll be back shortly.

316
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,440
Go.

317
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,780
- Boats are all secure, sir. - Bull.

318
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,520
The Brits are on the way, pass the word.

319
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,430
Sir, you missed a signature here.

320
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,970
- Moose Heyliger? - That's me, sir.

321
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
God bless you, my man.

322
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,340
- We're ready to go, sir. - Where's the rest of you?

323
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,670
Right.

324
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,640
- And here we all are. - Let's go.

325
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,290
Wahai, Mohammed! Wahai, Mohammed!

326
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,760
Moose Heyliger and the American 101st...

327
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,530
...have done the Red Devils a great service, making it possible for us to return...

328
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,660
...and fight the enemy on another day.

329
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,270
To Easy Company, victory and Currahee.

330
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,740
Currahee!

331
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,870
I was only Easy's CO for four months, Moose.

332
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,590
Before that it was Meehan's company, and before that Sobel's.

333
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,360
But you're the only combat commander they've ever known.

334
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,950
And I'm from another company.

335
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,520
You know where they came from, you know what they've been through.

336
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,030
Just hang tough.

337
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,940
Train your new platoon leaders, and trust your noncoms.

338
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,300
Halt!

339
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,570
- It's Moose. - Hold your fire!

340
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,680
Okay, buddy.

341
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,350
Oh, my god.

342
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,690
Send for Lt. Welsh.

343
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,990
Stay awake on me, Moose.

344
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,890
Here, look in my eyes. Send for Lt. Welsh, now!

345
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,390
Okay.

346
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,890
I'm sorry, sir. I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

347
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,160
Jesus Christ.

348
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,600
- Where are you from, trooper? - Wyoming, sir.

349
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,540
You're a long way from home, Private.

350
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,340
Stretcher! I got him, Harry.

351
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,710
- Give him morphine? - Yeah.

352
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,940
- How much? - I don't know, two, three Syrettes maybe.

353
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,710
- Three Syrettes maybe? - Yeah.

354
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,010
- Were you trying to kill him? - I think it was two.

355
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,920
It's important to let me know how much medication he's had.

356
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,250
I do not see one Syrette on the man's jacket.

357
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,120
- Sorry, doc. - Sure is a good thing he's a big man. Maybe he'll stand a chance.

358
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,920
We didn't know what to do for his pain.

359
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah, but you are officers, you are grownups, you ought to know.

360
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,630
All right, let's go, come on, move it!

361
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,440
Mama, mama, can't you see

362
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,540
What the airborne's done to me?

363
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,610
What the airborne's done to me?

364
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,810
- Once more. - About face.

365
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,080
Forward march.

366
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,260
Easy still has only 65 percent strength...

367
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,780
...and most of those are replacements, including their new CO.

368
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,020
- How's Lt. Dike doing? - Three weeks in Holland...

369
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,470
...the guys are already calling him Foxhole Norman.

370
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,500
They're talking about a mid-march action at the earliest.

371
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,560
So, we train the guys for three months, we jump into Berlin, we end the war.

372
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,770
The only thing holding together Easy Company is the NCOs, Toccoa men.

373
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,540
Sir, there's a Sgt. Guarnere here to see you.

374
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,050
Look what the train brought in.

375
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,310
- The daredevil. - Hiya, Captain.

376
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,780
Welcome back, Bill.

377
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,480
It's true. I never thought I'd see you behind a desk.

378
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,920
Yeah, and someday he'll sit behind it.

379
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,790
I just went awol from the hospital to get back here, sir.

380
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,420
I hope it won't cause you a problem.

381
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,120
- Would you care if it did? - Not a bit, sir.

382
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,630
Got a letter for you here from Moose, Lt. Heyliger, sir.

383
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,260
He's recovering, but it's gonna be a long haul.

384
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,710
Thanks, Bill.

385
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,050
I hear there's gonna be a football game. Those chumps from the 5-0-deuce, right?

386
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,710
- Yeah, Christmas day. - Great, sky train boys.

387
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,790
Can't wait.

388
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,050
Great.

389
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,260
I

390
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,630
- I'll just go find some trouble. - You do that.

391
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,260
- Bill. - Sir?

392
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,800
No more joyriding, right?

393
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,140
Anybody ever heard of a little joint called Lulu's?

394
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,210
You got me.

395
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,280
I'll just ask around.

396
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,060
I guess now's as good a time as any.

397
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,190
What's that? I don't wanna see another piece of paper.

398
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,060
Gen. Taylor has flown back to Washington.

399
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,830
He's left Gen. McAuliffe in charge of the division.

400
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,200
Col. Sink is in Rheims to see Marlene Dietrich.

401
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,100
- Marlene Dietrich is in Rheims? - At the USO.

402
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,570
I'm going to Rheims.

403
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,010
Strayer is in London for at least a week for Lt. Col. Dobie's wedding.

404
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,210
I am heading back to Aldbourne to look up a certain young lady.

405
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,950
- What are you telling me? - You, my friend, are headed to Paris.

406
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,680
City of light. That's a 48-hour pass.

407
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,120
It's been decided that you need a little dose of civilization.

408
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,830
Bon voyage.

409
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,560
I second that.

410
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,360
The airborne is as tough as they come.

411
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,930
Basic training.

412
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,970
You know what I did in basic training?

413
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,010
I had to eat rats in basic training.

414
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,410
That's the first time...

415
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,220
Monsieur?

416
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
Monsieur, c'est le terminus. Le train s'arrete ici, on doit tous descendre.

417
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,160
Every time I look at you, I see eight or nine of you.

418
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,830
- I'll be all right when I can only see one. - Look at me, I'm John Wayne.

419
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,390
The costume department set me up with these great navy whites.

420
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,450
Luz, shut up.

421
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,900
What do you think?

422
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,430
- I'm trying to watch this. - I've seen this movie 13 times, okay?

423
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,480
- I haven't, so, shut up. - Watch the movie. It's fine.

424
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,120
- Skip. - Come on.

425
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,910
Where've you been? I've been lookin' all over for you.

426
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,780
Don, I was at home in Tannawanda.

427
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,790
But then Hitler started this whole thing, so, now I'm here.

428
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,920
- How'd you make out in craps? - Not so bad.

429
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,590
- Here's the $60 I borrowed. - You're paying me back?

430
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,720
- And, to say thank you... - Surprising.

431
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,030
- ...a tip. - Jesus!

432
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,500
Shut up! Shut up!

433
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,830
I was up $6,000, but I only have $3,600 left.

434
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,100
What will you do with it?

435
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,470
Blow most of it in Paris as soon as possible.

436
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,530
Gimme a tip.

437
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,040
I don't think that climate in there agrees with you.

438
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,580
As a matter of fact I've been worried about your health altogether.

439
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,080
- Hey, Buck. - You don't look well.

440
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,280
How are you feeling? Your wounds heal, all four of them?

441
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,190
You seen this before?

442
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,820
Buck.

443
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,560
- Hi. - Is it any good?

444
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,360
Yeah.

445
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,170
- It's a real corker. - I warned you about this girl a month ago.

446
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,550
Won't anybody give you a light?

447
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,850
Lip, favorite part.

448
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,090
- "Got a penny? - Got a penny?"

449
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,700
- "Got a penny?" - Got a penny?

450
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,360
- What? - It's an English penny...

451
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,800
Lights!

452
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,380
- Come on. - Quiet!

453
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,100
You can't do that to the Duke.

454
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,110
I said, quiet!

455
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,850
Elements of the 1st and the 6th SS Panzer Division...

456
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,010
...have broken through in the Ardennes forest.

457
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,150
They've overrun the 28th Infantry and elements of the 4th.

458
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,220
All officers report to respective HQs. All passes are cancelled.

459
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,160
Enlisted men report to barracks and your platoon leaders.

460
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,030
Damn, what a day.

461
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,210
Got a light?

462
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,700
- Sir? - Lt. Peacock?

463
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,140
- Sir, have you seen Col. Strayer? - Where's the company commander?

464
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,540
Lt. Dike, I've been looking for him all day.

465
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,210
How is it that the 4th Army's problem gets dumped on the airborne?

466
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,270
Lt. Peacock, Lt. Compton, Capt. Winters.

467
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,010
- Lt. Dike, I've been looking for you. - We have a problem.

468
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,790
Col. Strayer is not back from some wedding in London. Can you believe that?

469
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,760
We're going to the front here and our CO isn't even in the same country.

470
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,590
You have a bigger problem. Lt. Dike

471
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,090
Men are returning to action without proper cold weather clothing or enough ammo.

472
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,160
Sir?

473
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,500
I suggest you take a canvass of the entire base.

474
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,830
Get what materials you have before you roll out.

475
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,400
- Or have you done that already? - No, sir.

476
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,970
K-rations, as many as you can scrounge.

477
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,200
- We don't know if we'll be resupplied. - Yes, sir.

478
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,270
- What about ammo? - There is no more ammo.

479
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,440
Distribute it as best you can so at least everybody has something.

480
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,510
Yes, sir.

481
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,020
Lt. Compton, Lt. Peacock, inform Lt. Shames of the situation.

482
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,780
Equip your platoons as best you can...

483
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,520
...and then report to me, understood?

484
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,890
- Yes, sir. - Captain.

485
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,210
I guess the blackout's not in effect. Luftwaffe must be asleep.

486
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,120
What a difference a day makes, Lieutenant.

487
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,560
Christ, I miss those C-47s.

488
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,960
We've got a tailgate jump here.

489
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,800
Where are they sending us? What are we supposed to do with no ammo?

490
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,360
Kid, what's your name again?

491
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,710
Suerth. Suerth, Junior.

492
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,610
- You got any ammo, Junior? - Just what I'm carrying.

493
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,810
What about socks, Junior? You got extra socks?

494
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,780
- A pair. - You need four, minimum.

495
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,520
Feet, hands, neck, balls. Extra socks warms them all.

496
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,350
Okay, we all remember that one. But did we remember the socks?

497
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,420
I'd give my goddamn boots for a cigarette.

498
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,990
- We're out of ammo and socks. - Anybody got a cigarette?

499
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,360
- I bet Junior's got plenty of both. - I don't.

500
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,960
- How about a hat, you got a hat? - You got extra ammo?

501
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,500
- What about a coat, you got a coat? - I need to pee.

502
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,930
How about some smokes then?

503
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,880
- Yeah, I got some smokes. - Now you're talking.

504
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,710
- Over here. Pass them down. - Somebody, give me a light.

505
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,940
Keep moving. Come on, keep it coming.

506
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,780
Over to the left.

507
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,380
Keep it moving. All the way down.

508
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,070
Get moving, guys.

509
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,740
All right guys, 15 minutes. Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

510
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,980
- Keep warm, guys. - Where the hell are we?

511
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,980
Sure we ain't in hell, it's too damn cold.

512
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,250
Stand back, guys. I've been holding this for the last hour.

513
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,890
Anybody got any matches?

514
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,160
Gather round, guys.

515
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,850
Wait right here, don't go anywhere. Welcome to Belgium.

516
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,410
This area's known as Bastogne.

517
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,150
Strategic crossroads town.

518
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,250
Seven roads leading in, seven roads leading out...

519
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,760
...which makes it ideal for Kraut armor.

520
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,620
Now, lke wants to make sure...

521
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,920
...that the Krauts can't use those roads...

522
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,400
...so, we'll put a perimeter around Bastogne...

523
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,020
...dig in tight as a tick.

524
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,200
- 2nd Battalion will deploy to the east in this wooded area. - Thank God...

525
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,930
- ...barely made it. - Better get yourself some ODS, Bob.

526
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,980
Okay.

527
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,530
1st Battalion's to the north on your left flank.

528
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,700
3rd Battalion's in reserve. Andy, let's roll.

529
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,180
- Sir, we're a little short on ammunition. - How short?

530
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,150
There was a limited supply in camp, sir.

531
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,350
Captain, you beg, borrow, or steal ammo, but you defend this area.

532
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,910
Yes, sir.

533
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,290
Jesus Christ.

534
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,440
Bill, Don, come here, look at this.

535
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,450
Hold on. Jesus, I'm done.

536
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,010
What the...

537
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,990
What the hell is going on?

538
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,960
You're going the wrong way.

539
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,360
Pal.

540
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,090
Pal, what happened? Where the hell are you going?

541
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,970
They came out of nowhere, they slaughtered us.

542
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,560
- You gotta get outta here. - We just got here. - Give me your ammo.

543
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,440
- Come on. - Take it, you'll need it.

544
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,440
Go on, get out of here.

545
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,150
Jesus Christ

546
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,080
- Who's got ammo? - You got ammo?

547
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,250
- Gimme your ammo. - Who's got ammo?

548
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,450
- You got any grenades? - Come on, hand 'em over.

549
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,890
- Gimme it. - You got grenades?

550
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,430
- Got any grenades, Lieb? - Who's got grenades?

551
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,600
Private, what have you got?

552
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,570
Make a hole!

553
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,640
Make a hole! Make a hole.

554
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,410
I got ammo, grab what you can.

555
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,740
Lieutenant, you're a godsend.

556
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,840
- What's the situation? - I heard you guys were coming in.

557
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,550
There was an ammo dump, so here.

558
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,390
Is it just you guys in the 101st?

559
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,250
Looks like. What hit you fellows?

560
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,550
Everything.

561
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:15,320
The Krauts had tigers, panthers, SPs, stukers...

562
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,030
And infantry that just kept on coming.

563
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,390
- What's your name, Lieutenant? - George Rice, 10th Armor.

564
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,060
- Good work, son. - You got any more mortar rounds, sir?

565
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,110
We're real short.

566
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:28,630
I'll try to make another ammo run if I can, but don't count on anything.

567
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,910
Thank you, sir. I'll take this, Captain.

568
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:35,740
A panzer division's about to cut the road south.

569
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,787
Looks like you guys are gonna be surrounded.

570
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,722
We're paratroopers, Lieutenant. We're supposed to be surrounded.

571
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,203
- Good luck. - Thanks.
