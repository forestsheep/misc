1
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,490
When we left for Bastogne...

2
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,320
...we were short of equipment, we didn't have enough ammunition...

3
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,870
...we didn't have enough warm clothes.

4
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,230
But we had confidence...

5
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,900
...that our higher military authorities would get to us whatever we needed.

6
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,180
And there was a ridge with a tree line. We were dug in on that ridge.

7
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,840
The Germans knew right where we were, and they really gave us a shellacking.

8
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,290
Like in Bastogne, we were down to one round per man there for a while.

9
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,080
The fog was in.

10
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,790
They couldn't drop us or resupply us.

11
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,700
Every time they tried to drop supplies in to us...

12
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,960
...they missed us and dropped them to the Germans.

13
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,800
One of the guys got hit in the arm with a piece of shrapnel.

14
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,270
Took his arm off above the elbow.

15
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,330
And they were taking him out, he said, "Get my wristwatch off my arm."

16
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,250
And then a medic came along, and I think he really saved my life...

17
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,310
...because he stuck a Syrette in a key position. Morphine.

18
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,080
Even today, a real cold night...

19
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,280
...we go to bed and my wife will tell you that...

20
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,060
...first thing I'll say is, "I'm glad I'm not in Bastogne."

21
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,460
Duck, duck, duck!

22
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,570
Kommen Sie hier.

23
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,500
Kommen Sie hier, schnell!

24
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,210
Schnell!

25
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,330
Doc, bandage.

26
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,270
Take him back to Regiment.

27
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,570
As you all know, General McAuliffe, Acting Division Commander.

28
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,380
Give it to me straight!

29
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,880
We've been taking ground in one position, General...

30
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,720
...losing it in another.

31
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,750
And now it looks like a standoff. We're digging in on the edge of the forest.

32
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,490
We're under sporadic artillery fire, General.

33
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,430
We're taking a lot of hits, and we have no aid station.

34
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,760
We've run out of food, we have no winter clothes...

35
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,230
...and we have little or no ammo.

36
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,660
The line's spread so thin, the enemy wanders into our CP to use our slit trenches, sir.

37
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,970
We just can't cover the line.

38
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
Good morning, Captain Nixon.

39
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
You got anything to add for General McAuliffe?

40
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,250
General, yes, sir.

41
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,120
General, I took a walk along the line about 0300 last night.

42
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,680
Couldn't find the 501st on our right flank.

43
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,690
I tied in with a squad from our 2nd Platoon.

44
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,530
But, sir, we've got some considerable gaps in our perimeter.

45
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,360
I don't have enough people, sir. We're spread too damn thin.

46
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,530
Hold the line, Colonel, close the gaps.

47
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,240
This goddamn fog won't lift any time soon...

48
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,540
...so you can forget about air cover.

49
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,210
Your 1st Battalion just pulled out of Foy, Krauts on their tail.

50
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,370
Tanks, artillery. Got no backup.

51
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,810
There's a lot of shit heading this way.

52
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,770
Can I scrounge a bandage from your aid kit, sir?

53
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,970
How are you fixed?

54
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,570
No plasma, couple of bandages. Practically no morphine.

55
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,470
I tried to find my way up to 3rd Battalion...

56
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,450
...looking for supplies, but lost my way.

57
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,150
If you can't get over to 3rd, hook up with Doc Ryan.

58
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,850
He'll fix you up with what he has to spare.

59
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,520
Thanks, Captain.

60
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,500
Eugene, get everything you can.

61
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,730
You're gonna need it.

62
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,540
- Spina. - Doc. - What's happening?

63
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,010
- We're digging in right along the line. - Yeah?

64
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,570
Yeah, this is it.

65
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,140
So, what'd you get?

66
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
I got this.

67
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,450
And I got myself a Kraut bandage.

68
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,170
What, this is it?

69
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,883
Yeah, that's it, that's all you got.

70
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,930
Jesus

71
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,240
You know, 1st Battalion's pulled out of Foy.

72
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,540
Heavy casualties.

73
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,880
If they're pulling back, why are we sitting here?

74
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,680
We need morphine, this is all I've got.

75
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,920
You got extra scissors?

76
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,550
Just the one.

77
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,780
- First Sergeant Lipton! - Sir.

78
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,130
What's this?

79
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,130
- Two medics in one hole? - Yes, sir.

80
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,330
What's gonna happen to us if you take a hit?

81
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,260
Sir?

82
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,630
First Sergeant, where's my foxhole?

83
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,650
It's back here, sir.

84
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Maybe you missed it.

85
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,860
I'll walk you back, sir. You're a bit close to the line here.

86
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,330
Goddamn it.

87
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,100
Sergeant Guarnere, did you keep your morphine from Holland?

88
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,160
No.

89
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,495
Doc, I've gotta talk to you.

90
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,220
How's that leg?

91
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,648
To hell with the leg, I'm pissing needles.

92
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,010
Later.

93
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,210
Shit!

94
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,450
You seen them?

95
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,220
No. But they're out there.

96
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,820
Depend on it.

97
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,820
Cup of joe, Doc?

98
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,730
Gordon, I need scissors.

99
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,390
You got scissors, sharp scissors?

100
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,760
Scissors?

101
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,860
Well, let's see, I'll have to check the sewing room.

102
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,340
Might be upstairs in the study.

103
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,400
That skinny drawer in the middle of the desk.

104
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,970
All right, what about an extra Syrette in your aid kit?

105
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,170
Hide your morphine, guys.

106
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,380
- Muck, you all right? - I'm good!

107
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,450
Muck, Malarkey, take cover! We're okay!

108
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,860
Take a look at this shit! They've peppered my helmet!

109
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,990
Doc, morphine.

110
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,430
Here, take it! Where's Penkala?

111
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,990
Christ knows.

112
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,830
Medic!

113
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,800
Doc!

114
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,710
- Medic! - You guys hit?

115
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,380
Doc, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

116
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,260
What are you looking at him for? Watch the goddamn line.

117
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,260
- You got a Syrette? - No.

118
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,620
Medic!

119
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,890
Medic!

120
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,960
Doc!

121
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,830
Penkala!

122
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,810
Doc! It's the artery, I can feel it!

123
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,170
- Penkala, let go... - It's the goddamn artery!

124
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,180
Penkala, loosen your fingers, goddamn it!

125
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,540
- I'll bleed to death. - Relax your arm, Penky!

126
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,710
- It's not the artery. - I ain't going back, Doc.

127
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,120
- What? - I ain't going nowhere, not in this shit.

128
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,020
You don't wanna go, and you yell medic?

129
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,020
I don't need to go back to no aid station.

130
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,920
You're in luck, Penkala, because we don't got no aid station.

131
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,200
Penkala, I need scissors. You got scissors?

132
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,740
What the hell I need scissors for?

133
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,540
Got your aid kit?

134
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,020
Right, you don't need this, not yet.

135
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,210
I do.

136
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,220
- Who got hit? - Penkala.

137
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,730
All right, this is what I want you to do.

138
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,930
I want you to take someone and work your way to the 3rd Battalion.

139
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,730
You know what we need: Bandages, plasma.

140
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,630
Whatever you can beg, you beg, all right?

141
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,870
And get me some goddamn scissors. I can't get any.

142
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,570
And you get yourself a hot meal, too.

143
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,000
Go.

144
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,630
You know, he told me he was a goddamn virgin.

145
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,790
Who?

146
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,000
The replacement in my foxhole, Julian.

147
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,500
Yeah?

148
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,770
Goddamn virgin. Just a kid.

149
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,540
The only virgin I know is the Virgin Mary.

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,150
Hey, Babe, where the hell are we?

151
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,580
This way.

152
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,880
I don't like it.

153
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,430
Where the hell is 3rd Battalion?

154
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,860
Shit!

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,260
Come on.

156
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,900
- Come on, come on, give me a hand. - Go, go!

157
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,140
- Come on, Spina, move! - I'm moving!

158
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,200
Get moving! Come on, go!

159
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,070
Okay, we can spare a few bandages, but that's it.

160
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,310
No morphine.

161
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,440
You'll have to go back to Bastogne for plasma.

162
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,110
It took us an hour to find you.

163
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,620
Doesn't your surgeon have plasma?

164
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,590
We don't have one. No surgeon, no aid station, nothing.

165
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,720
Just me and my buddy.

166
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,560
Sorry, guys, but we just can't help you.

167
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,100
Take cover!

168
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,460
Get your butts out of here! We're pulling back!

169
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,300
Come on, let's go!

170
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,500
Move!

171
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,700
Should have shot Hinkle in the ass! And you would have shot him in the ass!

172
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,800
God bless ya.

173
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,920
Yo, these smell like my armpit.

174
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,750
At least your armpit's warm.

175
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,090
Do you want syrup with that?

176
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,180
Joe, be honest. What's in these things anyway?

177
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,590
- Nothing you won't eat, Malarkey. - I won't eat malarkey.

178
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,890
Maybe Hinkle would like your share?

179
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,490
- Should've shot him when I could. - Running backwards?

180
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,500
Anybody seen Lieutenant Dike?

181
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,770
Try Battalion CP, sir.

182
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,760
Try Paris.

183
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,240
Try Hinkle.

184
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,770
"Hinkle, sweetie, I'm home."

185
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,670
Eugene, Lieutenant Dike's got a full aid kit. Try him.

186
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,480
Yeah, I'm sure he's not using his.

187
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,350
Maybe Hinkle's got a Syrette for you.

188
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,750
Eat your strudel. Hinkle-vinkle, eat the armpit?

189
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,290
Lieutenant Dike.

190
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,940
Can you spare something from your aid kit? I'm short. I need Syrettes.

191
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,060
- What, morphine? - Yes, sir.

192
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,970
What happens if I get hit?

193
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,510
I'll be there, sir.

194
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,910
- Syrettes in here, right? - Yes, it is.

195
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,150
Here.

196
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,820
I don't plan on getting hit.

197
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,420
Thank you, sir.

198
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,930
Heffron.

199
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,860
Heffron, you okay?

200
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,430
Gene, what is with the Heffron bullshit?

201
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,270
You know my name. Why don't you use it?

202
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,100
It's Edward, right?

203
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,180
Edward? Are you serious? Only the goddamn nuns call me Edward.

204
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,340
I need to know if you kept your morphine from Holland.

205
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,940
No, you asked me already, remember?

206
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,410
No, I don't recall.

207
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Gordon, you want me?

208
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,670
Oh, yeah, morphine.

209
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,640
3rd Platoon ponied up the contraband.

210
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,250
You still looking for scissors?

211
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,340
Yes, I am.

212
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,540
Perconte.

213
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,910
Perconte?

214
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,180
Doc.

215
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,650
Thank you.

216
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,750
And you'd better check on Joe Toye out on the OP.

217
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,860
He's missing something.

218
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,990
Thanks.

219
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,040
You guys okay?

220
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,740
They got hot food. Can you smell it?

221
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,820
- Toye, are you missing something? - Home.

222
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,780
Ask him to dance, Doc.

223
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,580
Toye, show me your feet.

224
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,220
You watch the goddamn line, McClung.

225
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,860
- Where are your boots? - In Washington, up General Taylor's ass.

226
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,420
- I don't believe this. - I can move better in bare feet, Doc.

227
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,030
What happened?

228
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,120
I took them off to dry my goddamn socks.

229
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,350
They got blown to hell, okay?

230
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,860
What's your size?

231
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,260
Nine, just like everybody else.

232
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,960
Frank, you keep cleaning those teeth, the Germans will see you a mile away.

233
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,770
- Shoot you dead. - That's right, Pee Wee, you keep laughing.

234
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,270
Hey, Doc.

235
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,040
My stuff!

236
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,540
Come on, Doc. You got a drug store in here?

237
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,380
No, I own my stuff.

238
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,970
What are you looking for?

239
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,450
Scissors. Thank you, Perconte.

240
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,650
My goddamn scissors!

241
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,390
- Sergeant Guarnere. - Gene, is that you?

242
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,950
Hey, Doc! Doc, come here!

243
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,260
USO. Picking up Syrettes. Alley, Liebgott, you got any?

244
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,670
No, got used in Holland, Doc.

245
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,470
You ain't using this stuff, are you, Doc, personally?

246
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,630
Come on.

247
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,700
Hey, Doc, I still got the itching.

248
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,370
Every time I pee, it's murder.

249
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm sorry, but I don't have penicillin for your...

250
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,040
My what?

251
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,410
Make sure you move around. Get your blood flowing.

252
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,470
I can't feel my feet.

253
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,110
That's why you gotta move, so you don't get trench foot.

254
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,310
Should I take my boots off?

255
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,720
All you gotta do is just loosen them up, keep moving.

256
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,290
Sergeant, I'm sorry.

257
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,520
Look, I know it must be hell, but I can't help you, all right?

258
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,890
Just drink lots of water.

259
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,660
Water? It's pissing that hurts!

260
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,860
Shut it! Shut the hell up!

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
What's going on here, Bill? Who the hell's singing?

262
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll find out, Lieutenant. I'll find out, I'll shut them up.

263
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,430
"Lord, grant that I shall never seek So much to be consoled as to console

264
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,660
"To be understood, as to understand Or to be loved

265
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,140
"As to love with all my heart.

266
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,110
"With all my heart"

267
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,210
Medic!

268
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,480
Medic!

269
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,250
- Perconte, you getting a jeep? - I'm on it, Doc.

270
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,200
- Look what they did to my leg! - Easy CP!

271
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,170
Easy CP, this is Perconte. Sisk has been hit and I need a jeep.

272
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,000
I say it again, I need a jeep now!

273
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,110
They're moving, goddamn it! We need it now!

274
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,710
Okay, Sisk, it ain't that bad.

275
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,540
Ain't that bad?

276
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,420
Pull!

277
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,260
No, Doc, save the morphine, I can make it. I can make it, save it, okay?

278
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,960
All right, let's get him out of here.

279
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,400
- Where's the goddamn jeep? - I don't know, but I hear it.

280
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,240
Jesus Christ!

281
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,070
You got blood all over my trousers.

282
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,340
I'm real sorry, Frank!

283
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,820
Get him up.

284
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,010
Damn it, Skinny.

285
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,960
Tell Spina I went in for plasma.

286
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,780
Come on.

287
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,370
All the tanks, artillery, are pulled back to here.

288
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,770
We've got no backup beyond Bastogne. This is it.

289
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,440
The Krauts captured the 326th Medical, and they took everybody...

290
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,170
...doctors, medics, the whole shebang.

291
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,840
We got nothing.

292
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,450
They're giving the boys hooch for the pain.

293
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,760
He took a mortar hit. Watch the leg.

294
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,430
- Yeah, watch the leg. - Get him in.

295
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,270
- Move it! - Coming through.

296
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,830
'Morning, fellas.

297
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,950
No, no, here, put him here.

298
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,650
Is he bad?

300
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,220
No, lower-leg wound, no morphine.

301
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,030
Nurse, have you got plasma? I can...

302
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,590
Wait, please.

303
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,100
What's going on here? Why aren't these men evacuated?

304
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,400
We can't evacuate. We're cut off.

305
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,530
This is as far as it goes.

306
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,780
Faites attention aux deplacements.

307
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,090
Ca va?

308
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,330
Ce n'est pas grave, ce n'est pas urgent.

309
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,030
I'm in heaven, Doc.

310
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,040
Pas encore, Dieu merci.

311
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,330
Nurse?

312
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,070
This way.

313
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,230
I need morphine, I need bandages, whatever you've got.

314
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Okay, I can give you a little, but not a lot.

315
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,480
There you go. You can have this today.

316
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,580
Do you want that?

317
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,290
Wait. You got plasma?

318
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,660
A little.

319
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,920
Are you a surgeon?

320
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,730
No, we don't got no surgeon.

321
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,230
What's this?

322
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,990
From the bed.

323
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,500
- What, sheets? - Yes, for bandages.

324
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,450
Yeah

325
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,170
- Voila. - Merci.

326
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,910
Comment vous appelez-vous?

327
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,780
My name is Renee.

328
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm Gene, Eugene Roe.

329
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,980
Where are you from?

330
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,950
Louisiana, half-Cajun.

331
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,750
Et toi, d'ou viens-tu?

332
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,120
Bastogne.

333
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,700
Can you get me back to the line?

334
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
Sure.

335
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,070
Eugene.

336
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,650
Chocolat.

337
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,650
Pour vous.

338
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,860
Benedictio dei omnipotentis patri et filii...

339
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,830
...et spiritus sancti descendat super vos...

340
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,970
...et maneat semper.

341
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,840
Amen. Amen.

342
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,910
Fight well for your God and your country.

343
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,580
God bless you all, and stay safe.

344
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,980
That's it, guys, nothing more to worry about.

345
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,250
We're gonna die now, we're gonna die in a state of grace.

346
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,590
Isn't that right, Babe?

347
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,690
Battalion want a reconnaissance patrol.

348
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,750
Kraut hunting.

349
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,920
All right, I'll go. Take these.

350
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,330
Give the boots to Joe Toye. Tell him they're a nine.

351
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,200
Keep going, till we make some kind of contact.

352
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,940
- Peacock's leading, right? - Right.

353
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,610
Asshole couldn't find a snowball in a blizzard.

354
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,550
That's what's happening, that's the order.

355
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,950
- Sarge? - Yeah, Julian.

356
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,350
Let me be the lead scout.

357
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,480
Back of the line, Private.

358
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,010
- All right, that's it, let's move out. - Tactical columns, gentlemen.

359
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,820
Doc, it's a combat patrol.

360
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,090
Why don't you stay back and keep your ass out of trouble?

361
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes, sir. Yeah.

362
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,240
Come on, Hoobler, pick it up.

363
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
Right, move on.

364
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,130
Go.

365
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,640
- Fire! - Get down! Get down!

366
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,310
Jesus!

367
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,350
Shit!

368
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,290
Bull! Christenson!

369
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,930
Up on line!

370
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,000
Johnny!

371
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,530
We got a man down!

372
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,400
Jack, over here.

373
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,670
What have we got?

374
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,180
- Keep still, Julian! - We've gotta make a move!

375
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,080
I can get him, Sarge.

376
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,210
Suppressing fire!

377
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,350
One man down, Easy!

378
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,010
Covering fire!

379
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,470
Easy CP, I have one man down!

380
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,310
Okay, stay there, don't move!

381
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,040
Stop moving, or else they'll keep shooting!

382
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,120
What's happening, sir?

383
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,550
We're pulling back.

384
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,160
We made contact. I gotta get to the CP.

385
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,260
Don't move! Stop moving! They'll keep firing! Stop moving!

386
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,630
Jesus Christ, fuck it!

387
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,140
- John! - What?

388
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,370
Pull back, we gotta pull back!

389
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,880
- Let's get the hell out of here! - Let's go, let's go!

390
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,810
Move! Go!

391
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,270
Stay with us, stay with us!

392
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,720
Hold on, Julian! Stay with us! Look at me, stay with us!

393
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,660
Look at me, hold on, hold on!

394
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,590
Don't move, Julian, we're coming back!

395
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,750
We'll get you out of here, just hold on!

396
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,800
Go! Let's go!

397
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,240
Move!

398
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,300
- Come on, let's go! - Where the hell are we?

399
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,280
Straight ahead, straight ahead!

400
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,640
Doc!

401
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,420
Okay, Christenson set it up on the rock.

402
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,830
Easy CP, Easy CP, lightning. Over.

403
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,860
I need an A-jeep standing by at the CP.

404
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,690
Okay, got you a jeep, Doc.

405
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,000
Martin!

406
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,940
- Sir! - What's going on?

407
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,030
They got Julian!

408
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,270
- He's still alive! - We don't know that!

409
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,900
- We gotta go get him! - Did you hit an OP or their line?

410
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,950
Their line, sir!

411
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,980
We've gotta go back, get Julian out of there!

412
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,180
- No, fall back! - We lost Peacock.

413
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,280
- No, he's back at the CP. - Come on, Martin, fall back!

414
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
Get him out of here!

415
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,020
Let's up and go!

416
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,760
Doc, we've gotta move now, Doc. Come on, let's go!

417
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,590
Doc, now, let's go!

418
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,930
Move!

419
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,270
- Let's go! - Fall back!

420
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,520
We couldn't get to him, Captain.

421
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,620
We tried. Babe tried. We couldn't get to him.

422
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,560
People

423
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,310
Let me sit in here with you guys.

424
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,060
Heffron?

425
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,090
Toye.

426
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,060
What you doing out here?

427
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,530
Thanks for the boots, Doc. Doing fine.

428
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,110
Are you still having trouble with your feet?

429
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,180
Show me, let me see it.

430
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,460
It's trench foot, Toye.

431
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,360
If it turns gangrene, you could lose it.

432
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,870
I ain't coming off the line, Doc.

433
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,240
You gotta stay dry.

434
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,370
Massage your feet.

435
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,810
Change socks every day and dry the wet ones around your neck.

436
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
- Trying. - Do it.

437
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,250
I'm working on it.

438
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,260
- You seen Heffron? - No.

439
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,050
Why?

440
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,160
He ain't in his hole.

441
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,200
Fuck.

442
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,380
Got you.

443
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,890
Heffron?

444
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,630
Edward?

445
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,300
Eat it.

446
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,180
Good.

447
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,150
Perfect.

448
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,360
I promised him, if he got hit...

449
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,730
...I'd get his stuff and bring it to his ma, you know?

450
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,530
Now the fucking Krauts will strip him.

451
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,340
No, it's okay.

452
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,470
It's not! It's not okay.

453
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,240
I should've got to him.

454
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,610
What do you call those people again? Those Cajun healers?

455
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,920
Traiteurs.

456
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,390
You know, my grandma was a traiteur.

457
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,990
Your grandmother? No shit?

458
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,360
She was.

459
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,060
Laid her hands on people and cured them.

460
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,310
Took away sickness, cancer, you name it.

461
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,810
Your grandma did that? You're shitting me.

462
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,470
I remember she used to pray a lot.

463
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,670
Yeah, I guess she had to.

464
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,650
Talked to God about the pain she pulled out.

465
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,550
Asked him to...

466
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,290
...carry it away.

467
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,560
That's what she did.

468
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,360
Jesus.

469
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm still trying to figure why they picked me for a medic.

470
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,440
God knows.

471
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,180
Snap of a finger, and just like that, you're a medic.

472
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,350
I've had enough playing doctor.

473
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,310
How about you?

474
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,410
Joe.

475
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,990
Take cover

476
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,620
Cease fire!

477
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,630
Cease fire, goddamn it!

478
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,190
Sergeant, I don't understand! It was our own planes!

479
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,190
C-47's.

480
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,660
They're bringing supplies. It's a drop.

481
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,830
It's a drop, come on!

482
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,500
All right, help the doc.

483
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,780
The rest of you come with me.

484
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,620
Medic!

485
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,250
Someone give us a hand here!

486
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,420
Help, help!

487
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,460
This one through here.

488
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,090
Now, vite!

489
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,680
Fais pression, essaie de trouver I'artere.

490
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,270
Oui, d'accord.

491
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,320
The artery, gotta find the artery!

492
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,550
Moi, je ne la trouve pas!

493
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,460
Anna!

494
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,320
Anna!

495
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Je ne la trouve pas!

496
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,210
Where does she come from?

497
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,250
The black girl?

498
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,730
The Congo.

499
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,860
How'd she get here?

500
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,190
Just like me.

501
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,660
She came to help.

502
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,380
Chocolat?

503
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,030
What?

504
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,940
Your hands.

505
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,270
My hands?

506
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,980
You're a good nurse.

507
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,290
No.

508
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,730
I never want to treat another wounded man again.

509
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,270
I'd rather work in a butcher shop.

510
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,340
But your touch...

511
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,070
...calms people.

512
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,350
That's a gift from God.

513
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,210
No, it's not a gift.

514
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,720
God would never give such a painful thing.

515
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
Nurse!

516
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,680
Nurse!

517
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,700
We need some help over here!

518
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,170
Guy's shot through the stomach.

519
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,770
How bad is it?

520
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,310
Okay, get this one in first.

521
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,120
You'll be all right.

522
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,840
Now we know how they felt.

523
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,150
What? Who?

524
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,690
The legionnaires...

525
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,260
...when they were watching the Huns...

526
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,450
...the Goths, the Visigoths.

527
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,950
Visigoths? Jesus Christ.

528
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,900
Barbarians.

529
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,360
They came right through here.

530
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,570
Right through these trees, just sweeping down...

531
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,170
...to burn the shit out of Rome.

532
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,770
That's a hell of a long ride.

533
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,110
So what's college like, Buck?

534
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,350
You got time to hit the books...

535
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,250
...with cheerleaders running their fingers through your hair?

536
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,520
Hell, Babe I can't even remember.

537
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,830
Hey, it's Doc.

538
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,370
- Sergeant. - Heffron.

539
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,940
Lieutenant.

540
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,530
Wrap up.

541
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,770
Never calls anybody by their nickname.

542
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,140
He once called me Edward.

543
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,240
Is that right?

544
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,480
Edward? That's your name?

545
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,580
Yeah.

546
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,850
Funny.

547
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,220
You don't look like an Edward.

548
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,030
Hey, Doc.

549
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,130
It's gonna get busy, pal.

550
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,640
Hold your fire, boys. Don't let them draw you out.

551
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,610
- Hold your fire! - Stay ready, boys.

552
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,610
What the hell are we gonna hit those things with, Lip?

553
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,200
Hold your fire! Get ready, Walter!

554
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,540
Stay in your holes, guys.

555
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,160
Smokey's hit! Medic!

556
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,620
Eugene, let's go!

557
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,520
- Come on, let's go! - Okay.

558
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,660
Go!

559
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,200
Ready.

560
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,900
Medic!

561
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,570
Doc! Smokey!

562
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,030
Hi, Mo.

563
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,580
I got it, I'm keeping it for you.

564
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,640
Smoke! I can't feel my legs, Gene.

565
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,910
Take it easy. My foxhole, get the plasma, now!

566
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,540
Here they come!

567
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,720
- You got them? - I got them. Go!

568
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,690
Machine guns, open fire!

569
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,510
Open fire!

570
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,560
Sergeant Lipton!

571
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,240
Doc, we gotta get the hell out of here.

572
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,500
Stay with us, Smokey. Stay with us!

573
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,980
We gotta get the hell outta here!

574
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,380
You ready?

575
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,980
All right, go!

576
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,160
- Stop, we've gotta stop. - All right.

577
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,060
- Take the plasma. - All right.

578
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,730
Come on, Walt.

579
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,310
Come on, buddy.

580
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,080
Hurry, Doc, come on, Doc. I've gotta get back to the line.

581
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,550
Okay, okay.

582
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,910
- Lip? - Yeah, buddy.

583
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,280
You're standing on my hand.

584
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,160
Sorry.

585
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,480
Look, I'll get you another Purple Heart for it.

586
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,160
Give us a hand!

587
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,430
I got you a ride, Doc.

588
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,650
Jones!

589
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,950
Give it here.

590
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,790
Okay, put him here.

591
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,920
Where's his tag?

592
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,760
Where's his tag? What's wrong with him?

593
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,560
Paralyzed.

594
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,760
What?

595
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,590
He's paralyzed.

596
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,430
Can't feel a thing.

597
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,310
"In the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

598
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,610
"Amen"

599
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,620
Eugene?

600
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,500
- Are you... - Renee, I need some help here.

601
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,200
Are you all right?

602
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,700
Renee!

603
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,230
Here you go, man.

604
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,670
- One for the doc? - Sure.

605
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,570
Doc?

606
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,660
Better than sitting down to a Christmas Eve dinner of turkey and hooch back at the division CP.

607
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,900
Damned if I don't like old Joe Domingus' rancid-ass beans better.

608
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,770
- Hello, Easy Company. - Hello, sir.

609
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,100
Hello, sir.

610
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,300
General McAuliffe sent a message to the entire division.

611
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,610
I thought maybe your people would like to hear it.

612
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,670
That should be your prerogative, sir.

613
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,110
All right.

614
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,940
Men!

615
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,180
General McAuliffe wishes us all a Merry Christmas.

616
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,820
"What's merry about all this, you ask.

617
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,230
"Just this.

618
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:48,690
"We've stopped cold everything that's been thrown at us from the north, east, south and west.

619
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,860
"Now, two days ago the German commander demanded our honorable surrender...

620
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,740
"...to save the USA encircled troops from total annihilation.

621
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,050
"The German commander received the following reply:

622
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,610
"'To the German commander:

623
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,080
"'Nuts! '

624
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,250
"We're giving our country and our loved ones at home a worthy Christmas present.

625
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,590
"And being privileged to take part in this gallant feat of arms...

626
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,860
"...we're truly making for ourselves a merry Christmas."

627
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,370
Merry Christmas to you all, and God bless you.

628
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,600
Merry Christmas, sir.

629
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,800
Nuts!

630
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:33,970
Bill.

631
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,540
Picture of my girl.

632
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,940
Good looking broad, Buck.

633
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,120
She's...

634
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,920
She's finished with me.

635
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,250
Yeah?

636
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,990
Yeah.

637
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,120
Yeah, she's...

638
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,370
Just in time for Christmas.

639
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,410
Just in time for Christmas.

640
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,450
Shit! I almost forgot.

641
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:29,030
- Lucky Strikes means fine tobacco. - Where the hell did you get those?

642
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,070
Merry Christmas, fellas.

643
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,830
Gotta thank jolly old Saint Luz.

644
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,100
Beautiful.

645
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,610
There you go, Penk.

646
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,750
I am shaking so goddamn much I feel like I'm dancing.

647
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,490
There you go, buddy. There you go.

648
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,780
Frank, what are you doing?

649
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,580
It's Christmas, Pee Wee.

650
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,120
Here, Frank.

651
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,830
- What is it? - Lemon-powder snow cone.

652
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,430
Pass. Merry fucking Christmas.

653
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,770
Harry.

654
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,310
- Fire's not a good idea. - Just a couple of minutes.

655
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,080
We're in a dell.

656
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,380
A dell?

657
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,560
Like where fairies and gnomes live?

658
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,700
I swear I thought I could smell a fire.

659
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,400
I did smell a fire.

660
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,630
Are you out of your mind?

661
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,800
We're in a dell.

662
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,040
Down! Crossfire!

663
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,550
God, no!

664
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,020
This is Captain Nixon. I need an A-jeep for Second Battalion CP.

665
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,720
- Stay still, Harry. - Doc, put that out!

666
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,430
Repeat, A-jeep for Second Battalion CP.

667
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,700
Medic!

668
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,900
Doc!

669
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,240
Come on, Doc.

670
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,370
- Is he hurt? - I don't know.

671
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,940
Move, get in!

672
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,170
Doc!

673
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,780
I gotta go.

674
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,150
Eugene, come on, get up. The captain's yelling.

675
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,990
- Come on, get up. - Okay.

676
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,620
Okay, get up! Not lie down!

677
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,530
Okay, get up, come on, move! Jesus Christ!

678
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,190
My hand, my goddamned hand!

679
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:44,930
Roe!

680
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,270
Jesus!

681
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,740
Okay.

682
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,140
Roe?

683
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,190
Stay still, Harry.

684
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,490
Just a scratch. You're not getting out this easy.

685
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,790
Jeep's on it's way. Hang tough. Here's a towel.

686
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,670
Towel.

687
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,640
Yeah sure.

688
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,740
I got morphine in my pocket. Give it to him.

689
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,250
- Where you want it? - Opposite thigh.

690
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,450
Okay.

691
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,520
Elevate his head.

692
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,230
Get him up.

693
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,670
There you go, soldier, take that.

694
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,970
Eugene, get yourself into town, get a hot meal.

695
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,820
Get out, quick!

696
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,370
Clear the road!

697
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,130
Get out, quick!

698
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,660
Stay out of there!

699
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,850
Keep moving!

700
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,060
Medic!

701
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,170
Get your ass out here!

702
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,270
Come on!

703
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:20,610
Every hour, on the hour, on the radio, but I don't know where the hell you are.

704
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,660
Everything okay?

705
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,660
Babe?

706
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,700
Yeah.

707
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,940
How'd you do that?

708
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,540
You did that.

709
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,210
I'll fix it up.

710
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,980
Hey, Gene. You called me Babe.

711
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,380
I did?

712
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,950
When?

713
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,750
Just now.

714
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,090
Babe.

715
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,860
I guess I did.

716
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,600
Babe.

717
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,340
Heffron, watch the goddamn line.
