1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,729
It was a situation there where everybody was happy...

2
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,528
...to see the war coming to an end...

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,268
...and the Germans didn't really have a heart for it.

4
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,467
They realized that the end was there.

5
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,967
We'd say the only good Kraut is a dead one.

6
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:24,007
But there was something in there that you know, hey that was a kid.

7
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,176
Most of them were kids. We all were kids.

8
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:28,576
They had a job to do the same way as me.

9
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:34,516
So, we went about and did the job that we had to do.

10
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:36,245
I think we thought that the Germans...

11
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,755
...were probably the evilest people in the world.

12
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,194
But...

13
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:42,994
...as the war went along...

14
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,864
...we found out also that it wasn't the Germans, per se.

15
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,763
A lot of those soldiers...

16
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,163
I've thought about this often.

17
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:51,963
That man and I might've been friends.

18
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,732
We might have had a lot in common.

19
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,632
He might have liked to fish, you know.

20
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,472
He might have liked to hunt.

21
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:58,942
You never know, you know.

22
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:01,071
They were doing what they were supposed to do.

23
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,701
And I was trying to do what I was supposed to do.

24
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,501
But, under different circumstances...

25
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:08,410
...we might have been good friends.

26
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,201
That way.

27
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:38,752
Tell you one thing about the Krauts:

28
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:40,962
They sure clean up good.

29
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:44,052
Yeah, all you need's a little Mozart.

30
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:46,921
Beethoven.

31
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:48,661
Sorry, sir?

32
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,171
That's not Mozart.

33
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,200
That's Beethoven.

34
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,887
Come on, chicken.

35
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:15,727
All right, this one's got some, George.

36
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:16,817
You...

37
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,897
You grab the chicken and I'm gonna grab the eggs.

38
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,466
Great, all right.

39
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,036
Just grab him by the foot.

40
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,196
Come on, chicken.

41
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,636
All right, If this thing bites me...

42
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,396
...Frank, I swear I'll shoot it.

43
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,335
Guten Tag, Fraulein.

44
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:33,805
Guten Tag.

45
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:35,934
Hold on! Hold...

46
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,674
But, George...

47
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:38,584
I'll be right back.

48
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,054
Hold on a second, hold on.

49
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:42,153
Hey, hey, come on.

50
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,653
I just wanna talk to you.

51
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,692
I just wanna talk to you, that's all, I just wanna talk.

52
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:55,702
Okay, look what I got. Chocolate bar?

53
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:58,291
You like that? You like chocolate?

54
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:00,361
Hey, Luz, why don't you leave her alone?

55
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:02,871
Frank, why don't you just leave me alone, okay?

56
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,000
You don't like chocolate?

57
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:05,100
I don't like it either.

58
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:06,700
How about this? Cigarettes.

59
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:07,900
Camel?

60
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,900
Yeah, you like that?

61
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,999
Come on, Luz.

62
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,979
Frank, please, why don't you go make your omelet?

63
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,779
Well, you ain't getting none of my eggs, blockhead.

64
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,608
Jesus, my friend just keeps talking.

65
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,748
Here, I got two packs here.

66
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,948
Give it to your friends or something.

67
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,857
Why don't you come and sit down?

68
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:26,987
Wanna sit down?

69
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:27,717
Here?

70
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,257
Come on, that's it.

71
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,865
Hey, Frank, hold on.

72
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,295
Perc, Jesus, come on.

73
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:47,934
What?

74
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,073
That Captain Nixon?

75
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,172
I think so.

76
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,282
What the hell's he doing in his harness?

77
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:03,342
I don't know.

78
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:05,452
Maybe we jumped into Berlin, the war's over.

79
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:08,621
So, what happened?

80
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:09,991
No dice with the Fraulein?

81
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,161
No dice. She smacked me in the mouth.

82
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,291
Tell you what, though.

83
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:16,630
Germany's looking to be pretty good fraternizing territory, huh?

84
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,140
Did you lose your cigarettes?

85
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, God.

86
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,100
God, ja, ja, ja.

87
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,969
Oh, God.

88
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,509
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

89
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,568
That's right, yeah.

90
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,238
Janovec!

91
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,508
Oh, shit!

92
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:35,917
Sir.

93
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,547
Where's my stuff?

94
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,357
I thought I'd leave it over there, sir.

95
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,003
Over there.

96
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,242
Here.

97
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,691
Thanks.

98
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,021
You're welcome, sir.

99
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, sir.

100
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,609
'Morning, sir.

101
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,068
'Morning.

102
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,638
You got a box all this stuff will fit into?

103
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,548
Yes, sir, I think so, same destination?

104
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,607
Yeah.

105
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:51,147
Yes, sir, I'll make sure it goes out first thing in the morning.

106
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,247
Thank you, Private.

107
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:56,527
Your folks are gonna have quite a collection by the time you get...

108
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,516
...home, sir.

109
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,785
Finders keepers.

110
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,555
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:31,751
Nix?

112
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,751
Nix?

113
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:34,881
In here.

114
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,089
Dog.

115
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,069
Making combat jumps with the 17th while I'm in supply briefings all morning.

116
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,358
Yeah, lucky me.

117
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,398
No, congratulations.

118
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:58,078
You're probably the only man in the 101st with three combat stars over his jump wings.

119
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:01,537
Not bad for someone who's never fired his weapon in combat?

120
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:03,817
Really?

121
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:05,306
Really, you've never...

122
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:06,116
No.

123
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,456
Not even with all the action we've seen?

124
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,185
Not a round.

125
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,755
So...

126
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:23,294
How'd it go this morning, the jump?

127
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,924
It was great, fantastic.

128
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,533
We took a direct hit over the drop zone.

129
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,703
I got out. Two others got out.

130
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:36,712
The rest of the boys?

131
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,142
Well, they blew up over Germany somewhere.

132
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:43,941
Yeah, I'm sorry.

133
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:45,351
About what?

134
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,411
Well, tough situation for the...

135
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:48,980
Oh, yeah, the boys, yeah.

136
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:50,320
It's terrible.

137
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,080
Oh, well, wasn't me.

138
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,859
You know, the real tragedy is they also lost their CO.

139
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,629
So guess who gets to write all the letters home.

140
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,128
Goddamn nightmare.

141
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,477
Got a visit from Colonel Sink this morning.

142
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,776
And how is the good colonel?

143
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,046
Concerned.

144
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,085
Still drinking nothing but the Vat 69?

145
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:33,024
Only the finest for Mrs. Nixon's baby boy.

146
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,094
Had a problem up at regiment?

147
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,623
What, this?

148
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,033
Is that what he said?

149
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,633
No, I just don't like it up there.

150
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:45,872
Good,

151
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,380
so you'll be happy to hear that Sink is transferring you back down to Battalion S-3.

152
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,711
What do you think I should write to these parents, Dick?

153
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,416
Hear what I said, Nix? You've been demoted.

154
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,626
Yeah, demoted, got you.

155
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,110
I don't know how to tell them...

156
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,420
...their kids never even got out of the plane.

157
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,519
You tell them what you always tell them:

158
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,359
"Their sons died as heroes."

159
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,029
You really still believe that?

160
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,538
Yeah, I do.

161
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,098
Don't you?

162
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,337
"The Cooperative for American Remittance to Europe...

163
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,676
"...or CARE, has begun assembling food packages stateside...

164
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:36,016
"...to assist those European families in dire need."

165
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,545
Which is presumably all of them.

166
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,115
So, notes home to your family reminding them...

167
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:44,214
...to donate whatever they can would be much appreciated.

168
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,464

"And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet

"Right behind the rain"

00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,641
O'Keefe, you were sitting on your bayonet there?

175
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,201
Why don't you leave the singing to Luz?

176
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,711
Hey, unless you wanna do...

177
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,111
...Surrey with the Fringe on Top, O'Keefe.

Rita Hayworth's getting married.

179
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,210
Oh, Rita, say it isn't true.

180
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,520
Abbott and Costello...

181
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,719
Wartime news.

182
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,759
"Resistance in the Rhur pocket's crumbling.

183
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,349
"It looks like there might be a breakout in Remagen."

00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,158
Apparently the Krauts forgot to blow up a bridge when they headed back over the Rhine.

185
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,388
I guess the boys in the 17th Airborne did okay after all.

186
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,697
Forget it, we'd be in Berlin by now, sir...

187
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,737
...if it was us instead of them?

188
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,206
That's right!

189
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:46,476
When do you think we'll jump into Berlin...

190
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:47,945
...see some real action?

191
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,145
You in a rush?

192
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,305
No.

193
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,685
So, you wanna go home with a Congressional Medal of Honor?

194
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:54,774
I just thought I'd ask.

195
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,784
Well, why don't you do us all a favor?

196
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,884
Don't think.

197
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,583
Damn replacements.

198
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:11,792
Hallelujah.

199
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,102
'Bout time.

200
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,641
Yeah, consider yourselves lucky.

201
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:17,501
Nixon was giving another current events lecture.

202
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:19,371
So, tell me nothing's happening.

203
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,741
Nothing's happening.

204
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,740
Couple of artillery rounds at dawn...

205
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,040
...probably from across the river, but...

206
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,080
...that's about it.

207
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,050
It spooked Hashey, though.

208
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,019
Here, Perco, I just finished it.

209
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,749
Oh, yeah? Any sex in it?

210
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,409
Ain't that kind of book.

211
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,458
- See you. - Yeah, see you.

212
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,427
Okay, move on.

213
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,165
Hey, O'Brien.

214
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:00,375
Relax, would you? I'm trying to read.

215
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,805
It's O'Keefe.

216
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:03,645
Is that right?

217
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,344
Yeah, Patrick O'Keefe.

218
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,004
My friends call me Paddy.

219
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,562
Hey, O'Brien.

220
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,061
Shut up!

221
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:29,331
I told you, it's O'Keefe.

222
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,431
Do you know why no one remembers your name?

223
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,970
It's 'cause no one wants to remember your name.

224
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,740
There's too many Smiths, Dimattos and O'Keefes...

225
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,379
...and O'Briens, who show up here replacing Toccoa men...

226
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,109
...that you replacements got killed in the first place.

227
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,949
And they're all like you. They're all piss and vinegar.

228
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,148
"Where are the Krauts at?"

229
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:50,188
"Let me at them."

230
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,228
"When will I get to jump into Berlin?"

231
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,988
Two days later, there they are...

232
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,787
...with their guts hanging out...

233
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,797
...and they're screaming for a medic.

234
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,697
Begging for their goddamn mother.

235
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,126
Them dumb fucks don't even know they're dead yet.

236
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:05,036
Hey, are you listening to me?

237
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,506
Do you get that this is the best part of fucking war I've seen?

238
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,975
I got hot chow, hot showers, warm bed.

239
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,535
Germany is almost as good as being home.

240
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,504
I even got to wipe my ass with real toilet paper today.

241
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:20,574
Quit asking about when you're gonna see some action, will you?

242
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,984
And stop with the fucking love songs!

243
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,100
When'd you ship out?

244
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,400
A few weeks ago?

245
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:50,170
Yeah.

246
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,609
It's been two years since I seen home.

247
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,438
Two years.

248
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,388
This fucking war.

249
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,618
Neither patrol found a single Kraut.

250
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,157
There were none here either.

251
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:09,017
They'll be across the river by now.

252
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,717
Let's send out a night patrol.

253
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,457
Check out the embankment on the far side.

254
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,666
President's dead.

255
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,995
Pair of queens bets.

256
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,625
All right, two bucks.

257
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:26,436
Nix.

258
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,146
No, I'm out.

259
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,266
All right.

260
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,276
Well, I'll call you two...

261
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,916
...and I'll raise you another two.

262
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:40,116
I can't believe we're not gonna drop into Berlin.

263
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,416
No shit.

264
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,716
Ike's gonna let the Russkies have it.

265
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,656
Russkies.

266
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:47,796
God damn it.

267
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,056
Let me tell you something:

268
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:50,926
This war is not about fighting anymore.

269
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,666
It's about who gets what.

270
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,396
Why don't you deal me out of the next hand?

271
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,806
What about your money?

272
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,036
Are we waiting on him again?

273
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,046
Yep.

274
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:56,796
Goddamn drugstore.

275
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,676
Sir.

276
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,106
Hey, guys, wait up.

277
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,016
Hey, Dexter, how you doing?

278
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,246
Good to see you.

279
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:14,786
You know who that was?

280
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:16,516
No.

281
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,436
'Morning.

282
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:31,936
Captain Nixon.

283
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,196
Good to see you, sir.

284
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,036
I think I have some mail for you.

285
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,576
Yeah, I was gonna drop it off this afternoon...

286
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:39,836
...with all the other 2nd Battalion mail.

287
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:42,606
But since you're here...

288
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:44,776
Thanks.

289
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:48,046
Listen, I'm having some trouble finding some whiskey.

290
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:48,886
Whiskey?

291
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,446
Yeah, a particular brand of whiskey.

292
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,686
Vat 69.

293
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:54,656
Exactly right.

294
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:55,986
I gotta be honest, sir...

295
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,186
...that ain't gonna be easy to find in Germany.

296
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,666
Pickings are kind of slim here.

297
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,096
Yeah, don't I know it?

298
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,106
And even if I do find some, sir...

299
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,896
...it ain't gonna be cheap.

300
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,236
That won't be a problem.

301
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,066
Hey, you hear the news?

302
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,576
Sorry, sir. I didn't realize that you were here.

303
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,606
What news?

304
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:13,436
300,000 Krauts just surrendered.

305
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,176
Three hundred?

306
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,616
Yeah, we're moving out in an hour.

307
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,376
- One hour? - Yeah

308
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,246
Sir, sir.

309
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:24,926
Your mail.

310
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:28,926
Keep looking.

311
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,596
Excuse me, pardon me.

312
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,696
Get a move on, let's go.

313
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,696
Jesus Christ, the dog?

314
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,606
Lew?

315
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,776
Cathy's divorcing me.

316
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:49,346
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,646
She's taking everything.

318
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,716
She's taking the house...

319
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,516
...taking the kid.

320
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,196
She's taking the dog.

321
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:00,586
It's not even her dog!

322
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:01,826
It's my dog!

323
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,916
She's taking my dog!

324
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,626
Let's go, load them up, come on!

325
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:20,076
Sarge, what do you have in here?

326
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:21,176
Germans?

327
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:22,916
Hey, Perconte.

328
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:24,746
You got a lighter?

329
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:25,916
No, sir, I don't smoke.

330
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,046
Hey, where we headed?

331
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,026
To the Alps. Let me see that lighter.

332
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:31,826
- The Alps? - Yeah.

333
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:34,016
- That near Berlin, sir? - No.

334
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:35,326
That's in Bavaria.

335
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:38,126
Birthplace of national socialism.

336
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,796
So, that mean no drop into Berlin?

337
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:42,626
No drop into Berlin.

338
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:46,396
Hitler ordered the Waffen SS to hide in the mountains and repel all invaders.

339
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:48,406
He wants them to start a guerrilla war.

340
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:49,446
Invaders.

341
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,546
Damn, I like the sound of that.

342
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,736
They'll die the last man trying.

343
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,076
- Sir. - What?

344
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,786
My lighter.

345
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,916
All right, nice lighter.

346
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:06,286
Thanks.

347
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,826
Waffen SS?

348
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,536
Looks like you'll get your wish anyway, O'Flannery.

349
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:11,866
Those guys...

350
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,436
Fucking crazy.

351
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,366
It's O'Keefe.

352
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,976
"He ain't gonna jump no more

353
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:25,146
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

354
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:28,906

00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,926

You okay, Nix?

365
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,216
Yeah, I'm fine.

366
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:06,756
"He ain't gonna jump no more"

367
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:08,876
She hates that dog.

368
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,156
"His blood went spurting high

369
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:15,166
"His comrades they were heard to say, 'A hell of a way to die'

370
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:18,766
"He laid there rolling 'round in the welter of his gore

371
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,536
"He ain't gonna jump no more

372
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,436
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

373
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:30,346
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

374
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:33,776
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

375
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:36,846
"He ain't gonna jump no more"

376
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:43,526
There's gonna be good times, Web.

377
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,926
When we get home, I mean.

378
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,426
First thing I'm gonna do...

379
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:49,966
...is get my job back at the cab company in Frisco.

380
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:54,106
Make a killing off all those sailors coming home, you know?

381
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:58,136
Then I'm gonna find me a nice Jewish girl...

382
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,606
...with great big, soft titties...

383
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,206
...and a smile to die for.

384
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:04,546
Marry her.

385
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,276
Then I'm gonna buy a house...

386
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:09,086
...a big house with lots of bedrooms...

387
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:11,956
...for all the little Liebgotts we're gonna be making.

388
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:13,816
She ought to like that.

389
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,686
Hey, Janovec, what you reading?

390
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:18,866
An article.

391
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:20,416
No shit.

392
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,086
What's it about?

393
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:25,106
It's about why we're fighting the war.

394
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:30,026
Why are we fighting the war, Janovec?

395
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,066
It seems that the Germans are bad.

396
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,636
Very bad.

397
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:36,406
You don't say.

398
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:38,306
The Germans are bad?

399
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:40,976
Hey, Frank, this guy's reading an article over here.

400
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,416
It says the Germans are bad.

401
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:45,386
So, what about you, Web?

402
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,046
You learn something new every day?

403
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:50,326
I guess I'll finish school first and then...

404
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,086
Wait a minute, finish school?

405
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:56,896
You mean all this time you've been talking about Harvard this...

406
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,126
...and Harvard that, and you ain't even finished?

407
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:01,266
For one thing I haven't told you anything.

408
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:03,876
Yes, yes, I haven't finished.

409
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,346
So the fuck what?

410
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:08,106
All right, Web, breathe a little. Jesus.

411
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:09,306
Fuck.

412
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:13,486
It's just the way you always talked, you know?

413
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,416
We all figured that...

414
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:20,686
Hey, you know, you're right.

415
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:21,886
So the fuck what?

416
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,426
So, what did you study?

417
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,726
Literature.

418
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,176
Get out of here.

419
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:36,636
You serious?

420
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:38,266
I love to read.

421
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,976
Do you?

422
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:42,346
Dick Tracy, Flash Gordon mostly.

423
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:46,186
Yeah, fuck.

424
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,796
Tell her she's got five minutes.

425
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,476
Raus, raus.

426
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,076
Sir, she says they've got nowhere to go...

427
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,706
...but the house next door is...

428
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,046
Hey, hey, do you hear this?

429
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,216
He says he ain't a Nazi.

430
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:22,516
Why haven't I met a Nazi yet in all of Germany?

431
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:24,556
We're only gonna be here one night.

432
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,556
You've got four minutes.

433
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:30,396
Raus.

434
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:32,596
Come on.

435
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,036
Let's go. Move!

436
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,756
All of you, out!

437
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,606
Look at them.

438
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:15,736
Even in defeat, they still know how to march with pride.

439
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:33,626
Hey, you!

440
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:37,696
That's right, you stupid Kraut bastards!

441
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:39,566
That's right!

442
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:43,196
Say hello to Ford and General fucking Motors.

443
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:46,006
You stupid fascist pigs.

444
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:47,436
Look at you!

445
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:48,946
You have horses.

446
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:50,606
What were you thinking?

447
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:52,116
That's enough, Webster.

448
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,546
Give it a rest.

449
00:28:56,556 --> 00:29:00,216
Dragging our asses half-way around the world...

450
00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:01,756
...interrupting our lives.

451
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:02,916
For what?

452
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,956
You ignorant, servile scum!

453
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,966
What the fuck are we doing here?

454
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,186
I wanna send out some patrols.

455
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:37,686
We'll have Dog here in the village. Easy and Fox in the woods.

456
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:39,756
Easy Company's gonna take the northwest. Lt. Lipton...

457
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:40,626
Sir.

458
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,326
Have 1st and 2nd Platoons go to the woods.

459
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:43,566
Have 3rd swing around.

460
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,086
Yes, sir. 1st Sergeant Talbert.

461
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,636
You're not worried about an ambush, are you?

462
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,226
No.

463
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:52,726
Just in case we have to stay here for the night.

464
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:13,156
- O'Keefe. - Sarge

465
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:15,556
Why the hell are you so jumpy, boy?

466
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:16,656
I'm not jumpy.

467
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,156
I'm fine.

468
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,696
Can hear your heart pounding in Arkansas, boy.

469
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:23,566
Jesus Christ, give the kid a break, Bull.

470
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:27,566
Hey, George.

471
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,506
Yeah?

472
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:31,146
Does this kind of remind you of Bastogne?

473
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:34,806
Yeah, now that you mention it.

474
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,586
Except, of course, there's no snow...

475
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:40,586
...we got warm grub in our bellies...

476
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:44,786
...and the trees aren't fucking exploding from Kraut artillery.

477
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:46,886
But, yeah, Frank, other than that...

478
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:48,356
...it's a lot like Bastogne.

479
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:49,516
Right.

480
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,166
Bull, smack him for me, please.

481
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,426
Thank you.

482
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,436
Hello?

483
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,446
Hello?

484
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:50,916
It sure is quiet.

485
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,316
He is right, fellows.

486
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:12,306
- You seen Foley? - No.

487
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:13,165
Hey, guys.

488
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:14,934
Any of you see any of the officers?

489
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:17,474
- No, speak to Popeye. - Hey Pop.

490
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:19,633
Popeye, you seen any officers? Nixon, Foley?

491
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:22,611
Speirs is searching them buildings right down the street.

492
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:23,611
What's the matter?

493
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:26,040
More, have you seen any of the officers?

494
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,539
Yeah, Major Winters is right in there.

495
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,209
Are you all right, Frank?

496
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:36,076
Major Winters, sir.

497
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:38,316
We found something.

498
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,544
We're out on patrol and we came across this...

499
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,553
What, what, what? Frank, Frank, what is it?

500
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:47,423
I don't know, sir.

501
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:49,692
I don't know.

502
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:12,312
Major, sir.

503
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,349
Open it up.

504
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,979
Yes, sir.

505
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,386
Stand back.

506
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:30,026
Give us some room here, stand back.

507
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:33,594
Back, back.

508
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,050
Christenson, any of your men speak German?

509
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:14,520
No, sir.

510
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,358
I need Liebgott. Liebgott!

511
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,728
Lipton, find me Liebgott.

512
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,557
Yes, sir.

513
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:22,357
Liebgott, Liebgott!

514
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,126
Liebgott!

515
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:27,195
Major needs you up front, right now.

516
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:28,324
Sure.

517
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:30,794
All right, boys.

518
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:31,923
These people need care.

519
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:34,023
Give them water and all spare rations.

520
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,692
Grab me some blankets, quick.

521
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:37,361
Oh, my God.

522
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:41,740
Dick?

523
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,241
I'm sorry.

524
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:35,001
Here, take some water.

525
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,109
Jesus, Web, can you believe this place?

526
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,678
No.

527
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:00,462
It's okay.

528
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,091
Better now.

529
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:12,997
He said the guards left this morning, sir.

530
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,464
They burned some of the huts first...

531
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:27,841
...with the prisoners still in them, sir alive.

532
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:29,071
Jesus Christ.

533
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,970
Some of the prisoners tried to stop them.

534
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,248
Some of them were killed.

535
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:46,914
They didn't have enough ammo for all the prisoners, so...

536
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:51,184
...they killed as many as they could...

537
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:55,692
...before they left the camp.

538
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:01,900
They locked the gates behind them and headed south.

539
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,728
Someone in town must have told them we were coming.

540
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:08,207
Yeah, I think so.

541
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,235
Will you ask him...

542
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:17,364
...ask him what kind of camp this is?

543
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,013
What...

544
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:22,612
Why are they here?

545
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,488
He says it's a work camp for...

546
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,857
Unerwunscht?

547
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:40,686
I'm not sure what the word means, sir.

548
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:44,724
Unwanted, disliked maybe?

549
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:45,954
Criminals?

550
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,063
I don't think criminals, sir.

551
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:53,831
No.

552
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,300
Doctors, musicians.

553
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,898
Tailors, clerks. Farmers, intellectuals. I mean, normal people.

554
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,037
Juden, Juden.

555
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:06,366
Juden.

556
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:11,775
They're Jews.

557
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:15,943
Poles and gypsies.

558
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:33,417
Liebgott?

559
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:38,265
The women's camp is at the next railroad stop.

560
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,804
Hey, Babe, come here.

561
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:13,982
Look at their arms.

562
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:18,850
Like cattle.

563
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,120
Goddamn.

564
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,859
Ah, Jesus.

565
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:44,210
O'Keefe?

566
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,438
O'Keefe?

567
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,289
I'm gonna call Sink.

568
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:19,797
Find Speirs and figure out how the hell to get them some food...

569
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:21,996
...and water.

570
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,002
Let's go, let's pick up the pace, come on.

571
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:38,650
Sergeant Martin...

572
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,549
...get what fits on the deuce and a half.

573
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,679
Move, let's move.

574
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:48,856
Shut up.

575
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:50,886
Take everything, take it all.

576
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:53,255
Check the back and shut up!

577
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:56,364
Check the back and see if there's any kind of...

578
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,363
Shut up!

579
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:06,070
I said shut up, you Nazi fuck!

580
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,729
You're not a Nazi?

581
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,199
My mistake, you fat fucking prick.

582
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:12,258
How about a human being? Are you one of those?

583
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:15,766
Or will you tell me you never smelled the fucking stench?

584
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:20,815
Let him go, Web.

585
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:24,113
He says he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about.

586
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,451
Bullshit.

587
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:47,625
Sergeant Talbert, this is chaos.

588
00:46:47,696 --> 00:46:49,825
There's plenty to go around, please.

589
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:58,402
We've got more water on the way.

590
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,731
Dick, Major Winters.

591
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:02,400
Yes, sir.

592
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,639
Sir.

593
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:09,238
This is Doctor Kent, the regimental surgeon.

594
00:47:09,308 --> 00:47:12,306
Doc, tell Major Winters and Captain Nixon what you just told me.

595
00:47:12,377 --> 00:47:15,405
Yes, sir. We need to stop giving these men food right now.

596
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:16,535
They're starving.

597
00:47:16,685 --> 00:47:18,314
If they eat too much too quickly...

598
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:19,874
...they'll eat themselves to death.

599
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:21,073
We need to keep them here...

600
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,483
...till we can find a place for them in town.

601
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:25,922
You want us to lock these people back up?

602
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:27,051
We got no choice, Nix.

603
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:28,381
Otherwise they might scatter.

604
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:29,790
We must keep them centralized...

605
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,450
...to supervise their food intake and medical treatment.

606
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,859
So, until we find some place better...

607
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:36,188
Colonel Sink.

608
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,627
It's a crying ass shame, but let's get it done.

609
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:40,356
Yes, sir.

610
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,556
I don't like it any more than you guys.

611
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:45,634
General Taylor?

612
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:47,464
Bob Sink, 506.

613
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,433
Sir, we're on, we're at Landsberg...

614
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,162
...the other side of Buchloe.

615
00:47:51,943 --> 00:47:54,672
We found something I believe you ought to see, sir.

616
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:57,200
I can't tell them that, sir.

617
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,539
You've got to, Joe.

618
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:06,507
Yes, sir.

619
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:14,014
Grant, Christenson.

620
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,283
The prisoners must be put back in the camp immediately.

621
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,082
Let the men know.

622
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:30,967
Turns out I'm staying in the only dry frigging house in Germany.

623
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,906
Thought you weren't drinking the local.

624
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:35,865
Yeah, well.

625
00:49:37,145 --> 00:49:38,504
Heard from Division.

626
00:49:40,384 --> 00:49:43,043
Been finding camps like this all over the place.

627
00:49:43,752 --> 00:49:45,241
Jesus.

628
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:49,580
Seems the Russians liberated one a lot worse.

629
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,819
Worse?

630
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,179
Yeah.

631
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,188
Apparently.

632
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:57,077
Ten times as big.

633
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,287
Execution chambers, ovens.

634
00:50:01,856 --> 00:50:03,925
For cremating all the bodies.

635
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,703
Jesus.

636
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:12,172
The locals claim that they never even knew the camp existed.

637
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,831
They say we're exaggerating.

638
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:18,070
Well, they're gonna have a hell of an education tomorrow.

639
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,968
General Taylor declared martial law about an hour ago.

640
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:26,547
Ordered every able-bodied German in town aged 14 to 80, to start burying the bodies.

641
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:28,306
That'll begin in the morning.

642
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:30,915
10th Armored are gonna supervise cleanup.

643
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:32,474
What about us?

644
00:50:32,555 --> 00:50:38,112
We head out for Thalheim, Thalheim, tomorrow.

645
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,022
1200 hours.

646
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,362
Kerchief, sir?

647
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:07,242
What?

648
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,501
No, thanks.

649
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,279
Move along.

650
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,439
Over there.

651
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:14,308
Don't stop. Keep digging.

652
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:16,477
You, too. Come on.

653
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:15,676
Hitler's dead.

654
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:18,255
Holy shit.

655
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,794
Shot himself in Berlin.

656
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:23,253
Is the war over, sir?

657
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,422
No.

658
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:29,731
We have orders to Berchtesgaden.

659
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,390
We're gonna move out in one hour.

660
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:33,660
Why, the man's not home?

661
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:37,998
Should've killed himself three years ago.

662
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:40,507
Saved us a lot of trouble.

663
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:43,376
Yeah, he should've...

664
00:53:46,146 --> 00:53:48,275
...but he didn't.
