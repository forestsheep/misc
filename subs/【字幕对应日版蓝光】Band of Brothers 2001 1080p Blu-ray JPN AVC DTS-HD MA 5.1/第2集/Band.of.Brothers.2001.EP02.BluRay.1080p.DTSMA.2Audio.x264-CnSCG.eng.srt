1
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,460
Standing in the door I could see...

2
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,670
...the lights on the drop zone...

3
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,070
...and I had to assume that was our drop zone...

4
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,770
...way in the ahead of us.

5
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,940
And so that we had the red light...

6
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,680
...I had everybody standing up ready to jump.

7
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,080
So, when the plane started to get hit...

8
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,520
...and suddenly the pilot gives me the green light...

9
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,490
...I'm out the door immediately.

10
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,700
We got such an opening blast from the opening shot...

11
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,670
...from the prop blast that it broke this chin strap that we had on this helmet liner.

12
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,940
And that's when I lost this famous leg bag...

13
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,630
...that everybody talks about...

14
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,400
...just from the shock of the opening.

15
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,950
It just flew right off my foot.

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,080
We came from the sky.

17
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,950
We hit, and in any direction you went...

18
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,510
...there would be enemy, you knew it.

19
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,020
And that was all part of what you accepted.

20
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,260
How do you prepare yourself mentally?

21
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,660
Each man must do that himself.

22
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,300
Each man must prepare himself mentally to make that jump.

23
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,200
At the back of your mind you, you know, you wonder what will happen and all that.

24
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,150
You know you've been trained and trained and trained...

25
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,310
...and what your job is gonna be...

26
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,510
...and what you're supposed to do and...

27
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,210
Oh, that's what you gotta think about, you know?

28
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,950
And we lost a lot of people that night...

29
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,200
...but you try to put it all out of your mind.

30
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,340
Give me a light.

31
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,620
Lip, did Evans make it?

32
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,350
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,090
He's in Lieutenant Meehan's stick, sir.

34
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,890
Lieutenant Meehan!

35
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,630
Lieutenant Meehan.

36
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,530
Will, could use some help.

37
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,510
Will.

38
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,580
Will, hey.

39
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,620
Will, I need your help here.

40
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,540
Get ready!

41
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,610
Stand up!

42
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,880
Hook up!

43
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,240
Equipment check!

44
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,860
Sound off for equipment check!

45
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,860
Ten okay!

46
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,860
Nine okay!

47
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,930
Eight okay!

48
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,860
Seven okay!

49
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,760
Six okay!

50
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,730
Five okay!

51
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,030
Four okay!

52
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,860
Three okay!

53
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,900
Two okay!

54
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,130
One okay!

55
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,540
Jesus Christ! Let's go, let's go!

56
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,730
Does that light look green to you?

57
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,830
No, let's go!

58
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,570
I'm hit!

59
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,620
Jesus, tell Meehan to get them out of there!

60
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
Ahh!

61
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,180
2:00!

62
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,010
Oh, Jesus Christ!

63
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,530
Go!

64
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I wanna jump, sir!

65
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,340
Now, listen to me, stay on the plane...

66
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,740
...you're not jumping!

67
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,410
He's okay.

68
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,100
No, sir, no!

69
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,880
All right, son of a bitch.

70
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,830
Where's the goddamn DZ?

71
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,430
Maybe it's three more minutes on this bearing!

72
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,860
We get any lower...

73
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,900
...we ain't gonna need any frigging parachutes!

74
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,060
Slow down!

75
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,830
We gotta get some altitude!

76
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,440
They can't jump at this speed!

77
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,880
We there?

78
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,880
Oh, God!

79
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,350
Oh, no!

80
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,310
Let's go!

81
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,660
Flash!

82
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,760
Shit!

83
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,370
I don't think that's the correct reply, trooper.

84
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,910
I say "flash", you say "thunder".

85
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes, sir, thunder, sir.

86
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,820
Musette bag.

87
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,550
Coach?

88
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,820
Sir, it's Hall, sir.

89
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,550
I was on the basketball team.

90
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,080
Leg bag?

91
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
Prop blast got it, sir...

92
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,750
...and my radio and batteries with it.

93
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,430
Mine, too.

94
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,130
Mine are somewhere behind those trees.

95
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,200
Okay.

96
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,340
Follow me.

97
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,870
To hell with that!

98
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,300
Wait until they reload.

99
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,810
Go.

100
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,550
Aren't you D Company?

101
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,420
Able, sir.

102
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,950
Guess that means one of us is in the wrong drop zone, sir?

103
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,920
Yeah, or both of us.

104
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,800
Do you have a weapon, sir?

105
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,300
Just my knife.

106
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,430
Do you have any idea where we are, sir?

107
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,030
Some.

108
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,700
So, you're a radioman?

109
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,870
Yes, sir.

110
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,470
Well, I was until I lost my radio on the jump.

111
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm sure I'll get chewed out for that.

112
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,740
Well, if you were in my platoon...

113
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,020
...I'd tell you you were a rifleman first, radioman second.

114
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,490
Maybe you could tell that to my platoon leader...

115
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,890
...when we find him.

116
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,590
If we find him.

117
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,820
It's a deal.

118
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,390
First, I need your help.

119
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,300
We'll locate some landmarks to get our bearings.

120
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,530
Keep your eyes peeled for buildings, farmhouses...

121
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,170
...bridges, roads, trees.

122
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,210
I wonder if the rest of them are as lost as we are.

123
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,180
We're not lost, Private.

124
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
We're in Normandy.

125
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,520
Who's that?

126
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,190
Lieutenant Winters, is that you?

127
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,430
Get in here, sit down.

128
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,670
Any weapon?

129
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,400
No, sir.

130
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,670
As soon as I hit the prop blast, so long leg bag.

131
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,830
All I got is this knife and some TNT.

132
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,880
These 82nd boys got their M-1s, though.

133
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,910
Oh, man, 82nd, where the hell are we?

134
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,410
Sir, I saw a sign back thataways.

135
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,610
It said, "Sainte-Mere-Eglise".

136
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,220
Flashlight.

137
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,190
Raincoat?

138
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,850
You got a raincoat? Yeah.

139
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,150
We're about seven kilometers away from our objective.

140
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,710
And four hours from when we need to have it secured.

141
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,350
So, we got a lot of walking ahead of us.

142
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,800
You men will stick with us until we find your unit.

143
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,630
Let's go.

144
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,730
Hey, Sarge, where are we going?

145
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,430
Causeway Number Two, Utah Beach.

146
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,200
The Germans flooded the fields inland.

147
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,210
We don't clear the routes, we ain't moving.

148
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,240
Five of us ain't gonna secure a road.

149
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,510
That Louie don't even have a weapon.

150
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,600
I don't remember hearing about any railroads near our objective.

151
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,530
I'm telling you...

152
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,200
...this is the spur line that runs parallel to the river.

153
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,000
We should be nearing a road and bridge.

154
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,270
Yeah, how would you know?

155
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,110
Because I studied sand tails, all right?

156
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,050
Probably a frigging train or...

157
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
Flash.

158
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,340
Thunder.

159
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,590
Lieutenant, is that you?

160
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,480
Malarkey?

161
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,650
Sir. Sir.

162
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,090
Glad to see you, sir.

163
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,260
Good to see you.

164
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,390
Nice to see you guys.

165
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,860
- Guarnere. - Sir.

166
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,000
You and Hall up front.

167
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,570
Who the hell is Hall?

168
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,800
Lipton.

169
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,570
Go.

170
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,660
Guarnere.

171
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,860
Wait for my command.

172
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,060
That's enough, Guarnere!

173
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,840
Everyone okay?

174
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,840
Yes, sir.

175
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,780
Next time I say wait for my command...

176
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,010
...you wait for my command, Sergeant.

177
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes, sir.

178
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,730
Here you go, Lieutenant.

179
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,560
Kraut weapon.

180
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,800
Fine, Quaker.

181
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,760
What's that guy's problem?

182
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,710
Gonorrhea.

183
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,570
Really?

184
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,610
His name, dummy, Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

185
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,910
So besides having a shitty name, what's his problem?

186
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,140
None of your fucking business, Cowboy.

187
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,160
All right, let's move out.

188
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,320
Sir.

189
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,260
Quietly.

190
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,870
Did you see him? He just sat there.

191
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,710
He didn't have a weapon.

192
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,340
What's he gonna do, shout at them?

193
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,540
Shouts at me for killing Krauts.

194
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,920
He just wanted you to wait for his command.

195
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,650
Joe, he don't even drink.

196
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,770
Lipton, Wynn.

197
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,310
Anybody need supplies or ammo, now's the time to get it.

198
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,920
McDowell, you okay?

199
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,020
Yes, Sergeant.

200
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,390
Then let's go.

201
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,130
Hey, I promised my kid brother I'd fetch him back a Luger.

202
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,730
So I got first dibs, okay?

203
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,000
Check that one.

204
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,670
It's the Navy.

205
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,310
The landings have started, let's go.

206
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,140
- Let's move it out. - Right on time.

207
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,280
Yeah, tell that to him, Cowboy.

208
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,020
My name's Hall.

209
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,080
That so?

210
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,120
Let's move out.

211
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,350
You just gotta learn to return his fire.

212
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,230
You gotta realize it ain't about you.

213
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,320
He just heard his...

214
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,920
Malarkey, shut your yap.

215
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,360
His brother got it at Cassino.

216
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,930
Found out before we jumped.

217
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,310
'Morning, sir.

218
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,120
Battalion sure will be happy to see you guys.

219
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,841
Where?

220
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,320
At the farm, sir.

221
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,360
Top of the morning to you fellows. Enjoying the war?

222
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,020
Where are you from, son?

223
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,300
Eugene, Oregon.

224
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,330
Eugene? You gotta be kidding me.

225
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,460
Popeye, did you hear this?

226
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,617
I'm from Astoria.

227
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,390
You don't say.

228
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,930
Yeah, Orange Street.

229
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,840
What gives? What are you doing in a Kraut uniform?

230
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,310
Volksdeutsche.

231
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,510
Come again?

232
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,510
My family answered the call.

233
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,320
All true Aryans should return to the fatherland.

234
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,320
Joined up in '41.

235
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,020
You're shitting me, right?

236
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,390
Hey, Malarkey, stop fraternizing with the enemy.

237
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,690
Get over here!

238
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
What got you to Eugene?

239
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,890
I was born in Eugene.

240
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,240
Really?

241
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,140
Popeye.

242
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,550
Hey, Popeye.

243
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,850
Hey, Harry.

244
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,880
Carry on.

245
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,420
Oh, Easy Company.

246
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,890
Welcome.

247
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,890
Good to see you.

248
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,220
Good to see you.

249
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,890
And this here's Hall, Able Company.

250
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,930
Known as Cowboy.

251
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,060
You from Texas?

252
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,160
Manhattan.

253
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
Hey boss, how you doing?

254
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,030
What's going on?

255
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,830
What's the hold up?

256
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,840
Not sure.

257
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,000
Five will get you ten it has to do with that.

258
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,870
Yeah.

259
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,570
It's good to see you, Dick.

260
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,950
Yeah, you too, Buck.

261
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,480
What's the situation?

262
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,540
Not good.

263
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,020
Ninety percent of the men are still unaccounted for.

264
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,780
Lieutenant Meehan?

265
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,290
No, no one's seen him, or anyone from his plane.

266
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,590
You know, if he is missing...

267
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,990
...wouldn't that put you in line to be the next commander of Easy?

268
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,990
Hey, Lieutenant Speirs.

269
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,400
How many men have Dog Company got assembled?

270
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,570
A handful, maybe 20.

271
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,640
You the only officer that made it?

272
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,870
So far.

273
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,400
Still waiting for orders.

274
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,340
You got some cigarettes?

275
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,610
Here.

276
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,350
Hey, keep the pack.

277
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,850
Yeah, so I was in the plant in '39.

278
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,020
That's when I was at Monarch tooling propeller shafts.

279
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,250
No kidding.

280
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,660
What are the chances of that?

281
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,460
You and me 100 miles from each other...

282
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,520
...working at practically the same job.

283
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,030
Hey, Malark, we're waiting on you.

284
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,260
Yeah, I'm coming.

285
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,000
Well, I gotta run, I'll see you around.

286
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,540
Yeah, see you around.

287
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,880
Zigaretten?

288
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,690
Here you go.

289
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,020
Danke.

290
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,160
Danke.

291
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,760
Thank you.

292
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,110
Shit.

293
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,810
Easy Company?

294
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,950
Easy?

295
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,750
Hey, any of you guys know where Easy Company is?

296
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,420
You seen Lt. Meehan?

297
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,860
No, not yet.

298
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, Major Strayer wants Easy Company's C.O. up front.

299
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,300
Well, I guess that means you, Dick.

300
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:11,860
Come on.

301
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,960
Son of a bitch.

302
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,370
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow?

303
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,140
In Berlin.

304
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,190
And the MGs?

305
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,420
I'd say right around here, sir.

306
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,120
I can't be sure.

307
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,590
There's some Kraut 88s up ahead.

308
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,090
Up ahead and to the right about, what, 300 yards?

309
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
Up through those gardens.

310
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,200
They're right between us and Causeway Number Two.

311
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,390
Firing on to the boys landing at Utah.

312
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,770
Think Easy can handle it?

313
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,070
Yes, sir.

314
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,070
'Cause my guess is they're doing some terrible damage there.

315
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,210
The 88s we've been hearing...

316
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,180
...have been spotted in a field, down the road aways.

317
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,180
Major Strayer wants us to take them out.

318
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,090
There are two guns that we know of firing on Utah Beach...

319
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,460
...and plan on a third and a fourth...

320
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,120
...here and here.

321
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,430
The Germans are in the trenches with access to the entire battery...

322
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,700
...and with machine-gun cover in the rear.

323
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,740
We'll establish a base of fire...

324
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,040
...and move under it hard and fast with two squads of three.

325
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,910
How many Krauts they think we're facing?

326
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,240
No idea.

327
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,340
No idea?

328
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,920
We'll take some TNT along with us to spike the guns.

329
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,420
Lipton, your responsibility.

330
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,550
Yes, sir.

331
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,990
Liebgott, you'll take the first machine gun...

332
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,590
...with Petty, A gunner.

333
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,390
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other.

334
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,690
Who does that leave?

335
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,230
Compton, Malarkey, Toye, Guarnere.

336
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,500
Okay.

337
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,500
We'll be making the main assault.

338
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,770
Understood?

339
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,710
Yes, sir.

340
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,180
All right, let's pack it up, boys.

341
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,380
Shouldn't you be outside with the other Able Company guys?

342
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,310
See you around, Hall.

343
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,030
Lipton, when you see we've captured the first gun...

344
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,920
...I want you and your TNT as fast as possible.

345
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,260
Yes, sir.

346
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,060
Okay, just weapons and ammo, drop everything else.

347
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,670
Got any spare ammo in a pack or a musette bag bring it along.

348
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,170
Lieutenant, sir?

349
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,870
I was wondering, sir, you need an extra hand?

350
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,570
Ain't you Sink's jeep driver?

351
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,180
So?

352
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,080
Oh, shit.

353
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,550
What's your name, trooper?

354
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,480
Lorraine, sir.

355
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,110
You're with me, Lorraine.

356
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,190
Compton, second squad.

357
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,120
Yes, sir.

358
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,210
All right, you heard the word, let's move, let's move.

359
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,520
Three cannons.

360
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,900
Petty, we've got escalating fire.

361
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,170
Right, let's go.

362
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,610
Stay down.

363
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,960
MG-42s.

364
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,030
I'll draw their fire to the right from the truck.

365
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,930
Take two men and hit them from the left.

366
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,860
Okay, go.

367
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,790
Right.

368
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,670
Take Ranney, envelop right, give covering fire.

369
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,400
Lorraine, on the machine gun.

370
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,840
Don't give away your position until you have to.

371
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,440
And I want that TNT as soon as we've captured the first gun. Go.

372
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,410
Yes, sir.

373
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,560
Go.

374
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,610
I can't see nothing.

375
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,020
Come on, Buck.

376
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,050
Oh, shit!

377
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,460
Let's go!

378
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,620
Let's go!

379
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,360
Follow me!

380
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,910
Oh, fuck!

381
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,840
It got my ass!

382
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,420
Sorry, sir.

383
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,890
Jesus Christ!

384
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,860
Fucking jeep jockey.

385
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,630
Shit, I'm sorry, sir.

386
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,860
I screwed up.

387
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,740
Grenade!

388
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,600
Joe, Joe, roll on, roll on!

389
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,810
God!

390
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,310
Shit.

391
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,550
You are one lucky bastard, Joe.

392
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,260
Guarnere, Malarkey, Lorraine, secure that gun!

393
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,390
Compton, covering fire.

394
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,870
Yes, sir!

395
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,710
Where are you hit, Pop?

396
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,280
I can't believe I fucked up. My ass, sir.

397
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,440
Your ass?

398
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,550
Oh, shit.

399
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,590
Popeye, how bad is it?

400
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,390
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean to fuck up.

401
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,150
I don't think it's too bad.

402
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,150
Can you make it back yourself?

403
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,500
I think so, sir.

404
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,230
Let's move out.

405
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,730
Right, here we go.

406
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,630
Drop your weapon, Pop, drop your weapon.

407
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,600
Come on!

408
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,300
One, two, three!

409
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,400
Get down, Dick, get down!

410
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,040
Pop!

411
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,080
Popeye, get down!

412
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,040
Winters, 1:00!

413
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,820
Grenade!

414
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,190
Toye!

415
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,650
Let's go! Get out of there!

416
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,710
Get out of there!

417
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,620
Toye!

418
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,960
Joe!

419
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,690
Jesus Christ.

420
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,990
Fucking twice.

421
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,200
Jesus Christ!

422
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,810
Lorraine, through, go!

423
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,000
Malark!

424
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,650
Ranney, let's move!

425
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,380
They've got the first gun.

426
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,790
There's the second gun.

427
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,130
Grenades first.

428
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,460
Then keep going, go!

429
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,660
Right.

430
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,840
Okay.

431
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,020
Nicht schieBen!

432
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:37,950
Nicht schieBen!

433
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,420
Bitte, nicht schieBen.

434
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,250
No make dead!

435
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,310
Shut up.

436
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,090
Nicht schieBen!

437
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,520
Shut the fuck up! No make dead.

438
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,460
Stay down, stay down!

439
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,715
Compton!

440
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:57,630
All right, cover for me.

441
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,070
We must be doing something right.

442
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,610
They're so confused they're firing on their own gun.

443
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,310
Let's blow this before they realize what's happening.

444
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,610
I'll see what's keeping Lip.

445
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,170
All right.

446
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,150
Toye, cover Lieutenant!

447
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,520
I think one of those dead Krauts has a Luger.

448
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,390
So what?

449
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,520
Keep your head low, Petty.

450
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,580
Come on, move it!

451
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,290
Have a little suppress in fire, why don't you?

452
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,520
Jesus Christ!

453
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,420
Malarkey!

454
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,440
Now you stop firing?

455
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,270
Beautiful.

456
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,330
Shit.

457
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,500
They must think he's a medic or something.

458
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,510
He's gonna need a goddamn medic.

459
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,100
Okay, okay, okay.

460
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,340
Malarkey!

461
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,580
Get low!

462
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,950
What the hell are you doing? Come on!

463
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,180
Forgot your frigging Luger?

464
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,930
You want I should go get it for you, you stupid Mick?

465
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,600
Where's Lipton with that TNT?

466
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,100
Don't know, sir.

467
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,100
You'll be all right.

468
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,370
I'm sorry, I messed up.

469
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,200
Don't be sorry.

470
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,440
Hey, Sarge?

471
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,510
You think this is a ticket home?

472
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,580
Maybe.

473
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,470
Shit, I just got here.

474
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,150
Hiya, Cowboy.

475
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,590
Shut your fucking Guinea trap, Gonorrhea.

476
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,520
He's all right, that kid.

477
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,650
You got a whole Kraut platoon out there.

478
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,160
Probably more, Captain.

479
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,060
You need help?

480
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,260
I need ammo, sir, lots of it!

481
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,300
And TNT!

482
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,560
I've got TNT, sir.

483
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,400
Good job, Private.

484
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,370
Hall, ready!

485
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,280
Sir, I don't have any way to set it off, sir.

486
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,900
Fire in the hole!

487
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,680
Plesha, covering fire.

488
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,140
Third gun, here!

489
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,310
Lorraine, grab some more of those potato mashers and follow me.

490
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,850
Malarkey, Hall, you two, go!

491
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,300
Running a little low on ammo, sir.

492
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,700
How about you, Malarkey?

493
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,740
Okay.

494
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,840
Think you got enough to take the third gun?

495
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,970
We'll soon find out, Dick.

496
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,170
Malarkey, let's go!

497
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,580
Toye, cover!

498
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,210
Okay, Hall, keep your head down.

499
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,280
Hall!

500
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,750
Leave your TNT!

501
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,020
Fire in the hole!

502
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,200
Malarkey, cover the front!

503
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,640
Go to the cannon, go.

504
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,900
Hey, Sarge. I'm looking for Battalion HQ.

505
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,200
Are you kidding?

506
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,070
It's back thataway.

507
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,270
You mean over...

508
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,210
Fire in the hole!

509
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,460
TNT!

510
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,530
TNT!

511
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,690
Don't need it.

512
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,830
What?

513
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,800
Don't need it!

514
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,700
Hall!

515
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,440
Hall?

516
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,110
Where'd he come from?

517
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,650
Winters, Hester said you needed ammo!

518
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,210
Malarkey!

519
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,890
As much as you can, everyone!

520
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,920
You mind if D Company takes a shot at the next gun?

521
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,320
All yours.

522
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
Let's go, Dog Company!

523
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,460
Up and at them, D Company.

524
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,660
Compton!

525
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,460
Who is that, Speirs?

526
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,810
What's he doing out of the trench?

527
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,640
Oh, what the hell's he doing?

528
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,810
Oh, Jesus.

529
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,720
Sir, had a little trouble...

530
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,690
...getting through that first field.

531
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,920
Oh, Christ.

532
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,900
We're gonna need it at the next gun.

533
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,430
Once it's blown, have them leave.

534
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,660
Go! Yes, sir.

535
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,660
Compton, police them both, then pull out!

536
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,500
Lorraine, Toye, move out!

537
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,710
Move out!

538
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,580
Move out! Move it out!

539
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,550
MGs first.

540
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,180
Fall back to your original positions.

541
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,950
Everyone else, maintain your base of fire.

542
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,630
Okay, back to battalion!

543
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,030
Go, go!

544
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,480
They were 105s, not 88s, sir.

545
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,170
We disabled them and pulled out.

546
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,480
I figure there's maybe 40 or so Krauts...

547
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,820
...still manning three MG-42s to the rear.

548
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,580
Hey, Popeye.

549
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,720
Forty?

550
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,020
Yes, sir.

551
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,250
We killed maybe around 20...

552
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,890
...so, yeah, probably there's 40 left.

553
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,520
I think we need artillery...

554
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,960
...or maybe mortars might do the job.

555
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,750
Going my way?

556
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,880
Sure.

557
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,710
Sergeant.

558
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,250
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

559
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,620
Nice ride you got here, Nix.

560
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,750
Straight from Utah Beach.

561
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,320
We should put them to work before they're missed.

562
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,670
By nightfall...

563
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,260
...Second Battalion had secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont...

564
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,940
...and elements of the 4th Division were beginning to move men and material inland.

565
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,550
Most of the 101st Airborne, including Easy Company...

566
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,710
...were still scattered all over Normandy...

567
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,380
...and the success of the invasion was far from certain.

568
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,820
We had an hour to rest...

569
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,550
...and scrounge for food we could...

570
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,090
...before we had to move south...

571
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,360
...and secure the town of Courville.

572
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,030
...die in the back of this damn truck.

573
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,970
Come on, you're stepping on my legs.

574
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,040
Jesus, let me out of here.

575
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,070
Light, light discipline.

576
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,370
Guarnere, close that flap.

577
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,010
Let the Krauts cook their own goddamn food.

578
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,810
How are we doing, Malark?

579
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,680
We're doing good.

580
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,240
Doing good?

581
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,350
What the hell do you know about cooking, you're Irish.

582
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,410
Sir, if you have a reservation someplace else...

583
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,980
Just start dishing it.

584
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,310
Thank you.

585
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,420
Shit.

586
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,220
Jesus Christ, give me some air.

587
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,470
'Evening.

588
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,580
Hello, sir.

589
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,010
Did something die in here?

590
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,480
Yeah, Malarkey's ass.

591
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,910
Any word on Lieutenant Meehan, sir?

592
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,460
No, not yet.

593
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,620
Don't that make you our commanding officer, sir?

594
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,860
Yeah, it does.

595
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,860
Sir?

596
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,870
Joe, the Lieutenant don't drink.

597
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,270
It's been a day of firsts.

598
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,680
Don't you think, Guarnere?

599
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,510
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,460
Carry on.

601
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,750
Good night, sir.

602
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,030
Oh, Sergeant?

603
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,620
Sir?

604
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,860
I'm not a Quaker.

605
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,730
If he's from Lancaster County, he's probably a Mennonite.

606
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,030
What's a Mennonite?

607
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,940
Hey, wait up!

608
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,710
What?

609
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,150
You know that map you found?

610
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,340
It had every Kraut gun in Normandy on it.

611
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,010
Oh, yeah?

612
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:53,880
Yeah.

613
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,480
Here.

614
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,050
Don't ever get a cat.

615
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,190
What's on your mind?

616
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,660
I lost a man today.

617
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,020
Hall.

618
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,330
Thanks.

619
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,130
A John Hall, New Yorker.

620
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,610
Got killed today at Brecourt.

621
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,310
I never knew him.

622
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,610
Yeah, you did.

623
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,540
Radio-op, 506th basketball team, Able Company.

624
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,980
He was a good man.

625
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,650
Man.

626
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,080
Not even old enough to buy a beer.

627
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,730
Not hungry.

628
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,660
Hey, Dick.

629
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,500
I sent that map up to Division.

630
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,060
I think it's gonna do some good.

631
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,680
That night I took time to thank God...

632
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,380
...for seeing me through that day of days...

633
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,080
...and prayed I would make it through D plus one.

634
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,060
And if, somehow, I managed to get home again...

635
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,090
...I promised God, and myself...

636
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,760
...that I would find a quiet piece of land someplace...

637
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,370
...and spend the rest of my life in peace.
