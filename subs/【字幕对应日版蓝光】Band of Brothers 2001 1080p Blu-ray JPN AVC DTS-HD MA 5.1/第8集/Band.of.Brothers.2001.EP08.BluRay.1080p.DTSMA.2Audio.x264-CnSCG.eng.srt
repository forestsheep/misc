1
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,290
We had lost some very good men there.

2
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,930
Toye and Guarnere had lost their legs there.

3
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,270
Guarnere... Gordon was badly hit.

4
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,710
A number of other people were killed.

5
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,140
It was a difficult situation there.

6
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,380
I don't know the exact amount of men that got killed in that...

7
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,950
...but six, seven of 'em, were real close friends of mine.

8
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,620
Skip Muck died, and Eugene Roe came to me...

9
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,220
...about 10 minutes after he was killed...

10
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,260
...and he wanted me to see if I wanted to go look at him.

11
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,500
I said, no, I wouldn't be able to stand that.

12
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,660
So, I didn't go look at him.

13
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,110
After Bastogne, we went to Haguenau. There was another push there.

14
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,140
We wanted to know what was across the river there what kind of strength they had.

15
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,010
You have a feeling you're gonna live through the war.

16
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,210
You have a feeling it's starting to ease off.

17
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,390
You can't account for it. It's just a gut feeling.

18
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,820
But everybody had that feeling.

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,120
"I believe I might be able to live through it."

20
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,220
So, walk carefully, take care of yourself.

21
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,620
The 101st Airborne had been made famous by what it did in the Battle of the Bulge.

22
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,060
Newspapers called them "the battered bastards of Bastogne."

23
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,250
They'd been through hell...

24
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,660
...and were now pulling into the comparative paradise of Haguenau...

25
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,530
...the sounds of the war still coming from just across the river.

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,430
I had missed Bastogne.

27
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,940
All I knew was what I'd read and heard around the replacement depot...

28
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,000
...that we had broken the enemy, and the war would soon be over.

29
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,880
Thanks for the lift.

30
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,450
When I was finally able to rejoin Easy Company...

31
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,890
...they looked nothing like the heroes who had just helped win the war.

32
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,948
George Luz!

33
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,150
Yeah?

34
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,200
It's me. Come on, I haven't been gone that long.

35
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,060
Jesus, yes, you have.

36
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,370
Now, look what I found.

37
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,600
Hey, guys. Sgt. Martin.

38
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,400
What do you want, Private?

39
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,710
I'm sorry, sir.

40
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,610
My name's David Webster. I just got back from the hospital.

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,170
Good for you.

42
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,700
Where's the rest of the guys?

43
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,240
This is everybody.

44
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,820
Come on, Sgt. Martin, this can't be everybody.

45
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,650
What about Hoobler? Where's he?

46
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,090
Lt. Foley, 2nd Platoon lost more guys than we did.

47
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,430
They're really short-handed.

48
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,440
Right, report to 2nd, Webster. They'll find a place for you.

49
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,740
Next truck up, Webster. You'll find 2nd. Move.

50
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,690
Hey, guys.

51
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,020
Some lieutenant told me to report to 2nd.

52
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,279
Your name's Jackson, right?

53
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,700
That's right.

54
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,316
Who's leading the platoon?

55
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,790
Sgt. Malarkey is.

56
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,890
What, no officers?

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,340
I guess you didn't hear...

58
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,334
No, what's that?

59
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:15,640
They're making Malarkey a lieutenant.

60
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,440
He's on the fast track now.

61
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,548
Really? That's great.

62
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,710
Yeah, isn't it?

63
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,410
Yeah. Jackson, help me up, will you?

64
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,288
So, you come from the hospital?

65
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,090
Yeah.

66
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,320
Must've liked that hospital, 'cause we left Holland four months ago.

67
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,530
I wasn't there the whole time.

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,300
There was rehabilitation, then the replacement depot.

69
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,140
I'm sure you tried to bust out and help us in Bastogne, Web.

70
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,542
I don't know how I would have done that.

71
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,470
That's funny, 'cause Popeye found a way.

72
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,180
So did Alley, right, back in Holland?

73
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,270
And Guarnere, and...

74
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,380
Yeah, where is Guarnere? He still your platoon sergeant?

75
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,790
No. He got hit.

76
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,620
Yeah?

77
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,850
Yeah, Bill got hit. Blew his whole leg off.

78
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,990
1st Platoon, moving out!

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,430
Okay, spread out.

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,340
Hold along this line till I figure out where we're going.

81
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,570
Sarge?

82
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,610
What's the matter, Webster?

83
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,901
Nervous in the service?

84
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,880
No.

85
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
No, I'm fine, Sarge.

86
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,380
Why don't you go talk to Capt. Speirs. Make sure he wants you with us.

87
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,330
Capt. Speirs?

88
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,523
What happened to Capt. Winters?

89
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,890
He's running the whole battalion now.

90
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,020
Go.

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,430
So, Easy Company had a new CO to go along with all the other new faces.

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,240
The guys I knew were either gone, or very different from what I remembered.

93
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,780
I was a veteran of D-day and Market Garden...

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,140
...had been with the company since its formation...

95
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,740
...but because I had missed Bastogne, I was treated as a replacement...

96
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,550
...and felt like I was starting all over again.

97
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,110
Look who it is. Nice digs, Lip?

98
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,020
- Yeah. - Sgt. Lipton?

99
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,490
Hey, look what I found.

100
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,690
- Feeling all right? - There you go.

101
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,790
- He's got pneumonia. - I'm sorry to hear that.

102
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,960
What are you sorry about?

103
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,760
He's alive, he's got a couch, a blanket, snug as a bug.

104
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,960
Yeah.

105
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,930
Sgt. Malarkey said to check with the CO if I should be in 2nd Platoon.

106
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,980
Have a seat, Webster. We'll get you situated.

107
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,910
How long have you been sick?

108
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,910
Long enough.

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,980
He wants us to cross the river.

110
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,320
Yeah, I bet that water's cold.

111
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,550
Should be able to get you some boats.

112
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,530
Had to be a full moon.

113
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,700
So much for the cover of darkness.

114
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,630
It's gonna leave the patrol exposed.

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,540
- Is this the company CP for Easy? - Yes, sir.

116
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,860
As you were.

117
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,410
Lt. Jones looking for Capt. Speirs.

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,450
He's on his way, sir. Why don't you sit down?

119
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,270
Can you get me a coffee? Would you like a coffee, sir?

120
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,410
- No, thank you. - All right.

121
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,080
What platoon are you in?

122
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,420
We're about to find that out.

123
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,490
You got any soap? I need a shave.

124
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll send some down.

125
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,290
You know what you're doing for this?

126
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,460
- I'm gonna let Speirs handle it. - Right.

127
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,900
Capt. Speirs, sir.

128
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,500
This is Lt. Jones.

129
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,130
Listen, will you go back in the back and sack out?

130
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,940
There are beds there with fresh sheets.

131
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,310
I will, sir.

132
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,110
Just trying to make myself useful, sir.

133
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,950
Listen up.

134
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,850
Regiment wants a patrol for prisoners.

135
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,880
This one comes straight from Col. Sink, so it's not my idea.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,520
Since the river's the line of resistance, we'll cross it to get to them.

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,650
What do we need to do?

138
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,530
There's a three-story building on the enemy side, up the embankment.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,630
We know it's occupied.

140
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,730
You can have 15 men.

141
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,570
Think very hard about who you wanna lead the patrol.

142
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,340
You'll need a lead scout, a translator.

143
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,500
I've got the entire battalion on covering fire.

144
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,510
- When? - Tonight, 0100.

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,840
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,250
Speirs, I want this one to be as fool proof, and as safe as possible.

147
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,690
Yeah, don't take any chances on this one. We're too far along for that.

148
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,920
Speirs, I want to discuss who might go along.

149
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,550
- Who are you? - Lt. Jones, sir.

150
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,220
Right, our West Pointer.

151
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,820
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,560
- When did you graduate? - June 6, sir.

153
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,240
June 6, of last year?

154
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,570
D-day, yes, sir.

155
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,100
All right. Don't get hurt.

156
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,780
Sir, I'd like to volunteer for the patrol.

157
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,350
- Speirs, talk to you in an hour. - Yeah.

158
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,380
Lt. Jones? We are short on offices.

159
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,760
You think a noncom could lead this?

160
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,350
I can think of a few possibilities.

161
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,590
Martin, Malarkey, Grant?

162
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,890
Honestly, sir, most of the NCOs could use a rest.

163
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,090
Captain, request permission to go on the patrol.

164
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,030
There's your answer.

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,130
No. You don't have any experience.

166
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,770
- Report to 2nd Platoon. - Yes, sir.

167
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,310
Tell...

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,980
Tell Heffron, Ramirez, and McClung they're going.

169
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,350
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,920
Sir, this is Pvt. Webster.

171
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,720
Sir, I'm Pvt. Webster from 1st Platoon.

172
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,590
I just got back from the hospital and Lt. Foley told me to go to 2nd...

173
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,830
- ...but Sgt. Malarkey said I... - Fine, 2nd.

174
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,490
Take Lt. Jones.

175
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,800
Lieutenant, OP-2.

176
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,640
Come on.

177
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,540
Are there other officers in the platoon?

178
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,110
No, sir. Just St. Malarkey.

179
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,880
But they tell me he's getting a battlefield commission.

180
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,430
Maybe he'll be assisting you, sir.

181
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,030
Who's that?

182
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,830
Webster?

183
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,130
That's right. How you doing, Sgt. Kiehn?

184
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,900
- Hi, Webster. - Hey, Sarge.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,060
Look what we just scrounged. We got some spuds.

186
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,230
Hey, OP-2, this way?

187
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,770
Shit, move! Go!

188
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,080
Shit, they spotted us!

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,480
- Is that it? - I don't know. I think so.

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,950
Go, go, go!

191
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,080
Come on, come on.

192
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,120
All clear! All clear!

193
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,320
Okay.

194
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,010
Wait, it was Heffron, McClung, and...

195
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,170
- Ramirez, come on. - Right.

196
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,450
Hey, guys.

197
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,890
- This taken? - Go ahead.

198
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,890
Sergeant, this is Lt. Jones.

199
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,030
Just assigned to 2nd Platoon.

200
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,790
Malarkey, Platoon Sergeant.

201
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,890
Congratulations on the battlefield commission.

202
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,730
The what?

203
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,270
They're making you an officer, no?

204
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,960
Me? No.

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,740
You must be thinking of First Sergeant Lipton.

206
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,210
My mistake.

207
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,050
So, you're without a platoon leader?

208
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
No, not anymore, Lieutenant.

209
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,850
Right.

210
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,490
So, do you wanna introduce me to the men?

211
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,130
Well, some are sleeping downstairs and the rest are right here.

212
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,580
Sergeant, a patrol's being planned for tonight 0100 hours, across the river.

213
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,740
Regiment wants POWs for interrogation.

214
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,750
What's the situation?

215
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,480
- Hey, Web. - What?

216
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,180
Come here.

217
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,740
- I wanna talk to you for a second. - Why?

218
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,350
- You want some coffee? - No.

219
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,890
- Fifteen. - Fifteen what?

220
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,920
Lugies since D-day.

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,160
- Any mortars? - 60s, out back.

222
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,060
- Is this kid out of high school yet? - Out of West Point.

223
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,870
West Point? Isn't that where lke went?

224
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,030
Yeah, he actually graduated with his son.

225
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,540
Shit, so...

226
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,040
What do you know about this patrol thing?

227
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,340
Nothing.

228
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,280
- Come on, you gotta know something. - I don't.

229
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,650
Bullshit.

230
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,310
You were there, right, at the CP?

231
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,050
This is a prisoner snatch, right?

232
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, Chuck, listen to this.

233
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,960
Come on, Webster, spill it.

234
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,370
Capt. Speirs is to pick 15 men.

235
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,540
Lt. Jones wants to be one of them.

236
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,370
I say let the kid go. He could use the experience.

237
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,610
Probably could find 14 replacements to help him out.

238
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,120
I take it this was already an outpost when you arrived?

239
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,310
There were some dogies from the 79th Infantry...

240
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,680
...but they left in a hurry.

241
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,810
What's the report on enemy activity?

242
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,320
Expect some flares, a few mortars at night...

243
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,220
...scattered 88s, snipers during the day.

244
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,160
Yeah, we dodged some mortars on our way in.

245
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,930
They also got some sort of railroad gun back there.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Shells about the size of a deuce and a half.

247
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,200
Sounds like a freight train when one comes over.

248
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,300
They haven't attempted to cross the river?

249
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,440
No.

250
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,610
They have roofs over their heads, sir. Just like us.

251
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,520
I don't think anybody wants to do anything stupid at this point, right?

252
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,320
Why are you holding out? I know you know.

253
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,860
- Just give us the names, Web. - Who?

254
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,300
There are three men here in this room, that think they should be on the patrol.

255
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,530
Who?

256
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,730
If I tell you, you can't let on that you know.

257
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,740
Your secret's safe, Web. Who is it?

258
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,410
Yeah, Heffron.

259
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,640
Shit!

260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,280
McClung.

261
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,920
And you.

262
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,320
He want any other guys from any other platoon?

263
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,060
No, I don't know. Not that I know of.

264
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,920
Look, that's all I know, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,630
So, it's McClung, Heffron, and Ramirez.

266
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,870
- I'll tell them. I just need you to point... - Listen up!

267
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,640
Got some bad news.

268
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,310
There is a patrol set for tonight, and so far, Speirs wants McClung...

269
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,050
- We know. - Yeah, we just fucking heard.

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,020
Webster here told us.

271
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,790
Easy, White.

272
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,550
Yeah.

273
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,460
Okay. All right, out.

274
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,270
The PX rations just came in.

275
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,640
Including winter shoe pacs.

276
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,170
- Beautiful. - Yeah, finally, right?

277
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,270
Good of 'em. Now we're in a nice warm house.

278
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Also, we get showers.

279
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,210
All right, let's move! Clear it out!

280
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,080
Come on, move, move!

281
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,190
Incoming!

282
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,750
Come on, come on, go!

283
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,160
Stay down! Stay low, stay low!

284
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,370
Okay.

285
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,070
Showers, let's go, come on.

286
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Somebody's been hit!

287
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,220
- What happened? - Casualty.

288
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,690
- Who is it? - Bill Kiehn.

289
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,230
I just left him. I was on my way back.

290
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,530
In war, soldiers sometimes die in the fever pitch of a firefight...

291
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,010
...or by artillery when they're huddled in a foxhole.

292
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,940
Bill Kiehn, a Toccoa man...

293
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,610
...was killed because he was carrying potatoes from one building into another...

294
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,450
...in the wrong place at the wrong time.

295
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,110
He was dead before Doc Roe even heard the call for a medic.

296
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,450
Get him out of here, will you?

297
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,020
- Let's go, let's get out of here. - Yeah, okay.

298
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,200
Did you know him well?

299
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,300
No, not really.

300
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,120
McClung.

301
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,420
Thanks.

302
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,930
Malarkey.

303
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,170
Jackson, you and Liebgott, Powers, Wynn, and Webster.

304
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,040
All right?

305
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,210
2nd Platoon, on me.

306
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,080
All right, I'm leading this patrol.

307
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,420
CO wants Grant, Liebgott, Wynn...

308
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,560
...Jackson, Shifty from 3rd Platoon, and Webster.

309
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,830
- They want anyone from 1st? - No.

310
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,670
- Anyone they don't want from 2nd? - Jesus Christ.

311
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,400
That list sounds like everybody to me.

312
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,640
It's always 2nd Platoon.

313
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,800
Swear to God, if we had three guys, they'd still want us for it.

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,870
I can't believe Malarkey's gonna lead it.

315
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,250
He only lost his five best friends. What the fuck's he gotta live for?

316
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,950
Has it been a long time since your last shower, Professor?

317
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,830
- Come on. - Is it hot water or cold?

318
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,670
- Come on, hurry up, will ya? - All right.

319
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,550
I guess I don't really need a shower.

320
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,180
I don't either.

321
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,220
- Lieutenant? - Yeah.

322
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,990
- You still wanna get your ODs dirty? - Of course.

323
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,860
I was just thinking.

324
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,900
Sgt. Malarkey's really in no condition to be on this patrol.

325
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,240
And maybe, if you offered, you could go in his place.

326
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,740
- Being that you are an officer... - No, they want someone with experience.

327
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,650
The guys they picked have plenty of that.

328
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,930
Lt. Jones wanted to experience combat before the war was over.

329
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,290
Malarkey had been on the front lines every time Easy Company had seen action since D-day.

330
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,470
If it was possible for them to switch places for the patrol...

331
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,590
...it would be a small moment of justice.

332
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,900
As welcome as a hot shower and a fresh uniform.

333
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,680
The decision, though, was not theirs to make.

334
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,970
Goddamn it, Johnny, you're breaking my heart, I'm telling you.

335
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,710
Come on, George, just give me, I don't know, 10, 15 bars.

336
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,190
Juicy Fruit. Happy?

337
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,740
We just got a report of movement.

338
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,420
Lipton wants you to lay a few bazooka rounds into a house across the river.

339
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,860
You'd think we could get at least one Hershey bar.

340
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,290
You're 1st Platoon at heart.

341
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,730
Jesus, Cobb, there's not enough.

342
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,890
Hershey bars!

343
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,020
Jesus Christ.

344
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,830
- Wait your turn. - Who are they for?

345
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,890
- Not you, Lieb. - Come on, George, one bar.

346
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,700
- No, there's not enough to go around. - Capt. Speirs here?

347
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,170
Down by the river, sir.

348
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,180
Hey, big mouth, give the kid a Hershey bar.

349
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,610
You gotta be shittin' me!

350
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,910
What's up, guys?

351
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,880
- I like what you did with the place, George. - Yeah, I did good.

352
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,890
- How you feeling? - If you keep your hands off my ass, fine.

353
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,360
- Have a Hershey. - Thanks.

354
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,050
- He gets a fuckin' Hershey bar? - He got shot in the ass.

355
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,360
Did I tell you to stick your ass out in the wind?

356
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,760
No, but I expect a little sympathy from you, right?

357
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,030
I should rub it for you?

358
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,430
Can you believe this guy?

359
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,530
Try to get him out of the war, he comes back.

360
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,270
That's not what I heard. I heard the Krauts are finished.

361
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,400
Yeah, just to make sure...

362
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,040
...we've gotta row across the fucking river tonight...

363
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,740
...grab a few, and ask 'em in person.

364
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,340
Are you kidding me?

365
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,280
Wish I was. Welcome back, Frank.

366
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,310
Yeah, Jesus, that reminds me, Web, I need you to run these to OP-2 for me.

367
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,410
Grenade launchers for the night patrol.

368
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,080
Any day now, Web, there you go.

369
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,520
You know what? Send these, too.

370
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,460
Did you hear what happened on D-company's patrol last night?

371
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,190
- What? - Replacement lieutenant blew his foot off.

372
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,740
Stepped on a Schu mine. Fresh in from West Point.

373
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,790
Had to come back empty handed.

374
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,100
No shit.

375
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,270
- Maybe he's a friend of yours, Lieutenant. - What you got in there?

376
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,750
More Hershey bars and Lucky Strikes for you rear-echelon fucks to hoard?

377
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,610
Cobb, with the mouth, please. The kid's just trying to do his job, all right?

378
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,710
Jesus Christ. You know what? To hell with it.

379
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,520
Count 'em up, Vest. I gotta go blast this house.

380
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,490
- You happy now? - You coming, Perco?

381
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,550
Make yourself useful, watch this shit for me.

382
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,820
Web, you're coming with me.

383
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,090
Is Capt. Speirs gonna be where you're headed?

384
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,060
- Same vicinity, yeah. - Then I'll join you.

385
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,120
- Where are we going? - To the house I gotta blast.

386
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,070
Capt. Winters gonna be with him?

387
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,570
Jesus, look, I don't know, maybe.

388
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,670
- Then I'm coming, too. - All right, come on, please.

389
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,710
Take it easy, I've been here all fucking day. Give me a bar.

390
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,010
Come on, you don't even smoke cigarettes, damn it!

391
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,780
Come on, I got a wounded ass.

392
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,010
Did intelligence give you any information on the CP?

393
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,050
Third house on the left.

394
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,020
Soon as our men are in the boats, I want a quad 50 opening up.

395
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,720
Capt. Winters?

396
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,350
About the patrol.

397
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,200
I feel that I should go on the patrol, sir. I know I could use the experience.

398
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,630
Denied. Anything else?

399
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,400
You're not gonna lead that patrol, Lt. Jones.

400
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,170
Permission to speak, sir.

401
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,840
Go on, Lieutenant.

402
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
It looks like Sgt. Malarkey could use a break.

403
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,090
I've discussed it with him, he said he didn't mind if I took his place on the patrol.

404
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,990
That was nice of him.

405
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,560
- Capt. Winters. - Yes.

406
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,500
I'd really like to be on that patrol, sir.

407
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,930
If it's true the Krauts are finished...

408
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,940
I haven't really done anything except deliver mail and type morning reports.

409
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,510
Absolutely.

410
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,810
Thank you, Captain.

411
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,380
He's got a point about Sgt. Malarkey.

412
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,980
Yeah, a point.

413
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,950
Fine, you can go.

414
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,830
There'll be a briefing, CP, 1700.

415
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,200
Yes, sir.

416
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,130
So, who do you have in mind leading this thing, if not Malarkey?

417
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,140
Come on. He can't be leading.

418
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm not sure what they decided.

419
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,490
No way. Not on his first day.

420
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,790
Do you see any other officer here?

421
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,730
What?

422
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,860
They call you guys, too?

423
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,970
So, who's in charge of this bullshit?

424
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,250
No, he ain't.

425
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,110
If he ain't, it's you, Chuck. Or Shifty or Mo.

426
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,910
That'd be better.

427
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,750
Ten-hutt!

428
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,150
At ease.

429
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,990
- Gentlemen. - Sir.

430
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,660
As you can see, we've assembled 15 of you here for this prisoner snatch tonight, 0100.

431
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,730
Just a couple of points.

432
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Secured four rubber boats to get you across the river.

433
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,800
Lt. Jones here is the ranking officer...

434
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,810
...and he'll be along as an observer.

435
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,520
Sgt. Martin here will lead the patrol in Sgt. Malarkey's place.

436
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,310
The whole battalion will be covering your withdrawal.

437
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,050
We've identified targets. We've planned fire for 'em.

438
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,110
We hear these whistles, we open up.

439
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,680
So don't blow them till you're back in the boats with your prisoners.

440
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,890
If the house turns out to be empty, sir?

441
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,800
It won't, but in any case...

442
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,160
...we know it's an outpost, we want it destroyed...

443
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,470
...so you have to lay some demo on a time delay.

444
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,030
You have to move fast, but carefully. Put a perimeter around the house.

445
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,540
Once in place, get rifle grenades in the window.

446
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,670
Get your assault team in quick. Okay, good, understood.

447
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,440
Remember, it's about prisoners.

448
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,710
Don't pop the first thing that moves.

449
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,880
- Clear? - Yes, sir.

450
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,780
Good.

451
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,220
Picked your assault team?

452
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,020
McClung, Sisk, Cobb, Garcia...

453
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,400
...and Webster, as translator.

454
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,460
The rest of you guys, a base of fire with Sgt. Grant.

455
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,580
You speak German, right, Webster?

456
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
Yeah, a little bit.

457
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,040
Good.

458
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,250
That's my team, sir.

459
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,710
Questions?

460
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,120
No, sir.

461
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,150
Good.

462
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,210
Good luck.

463
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,850
Thank you, sir.

464
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,390
Ten-hutt!

465
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,490
As you were. Carry on.

466
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,790
A little German?

467
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,500
His German's as good as mine.

468
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,580
It's not a concern of mine. - Jackson, you need this.

469
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,670
Can you believe that guy?

470
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,520
Webster, likes to get out of everything.

471
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,880
Whatever.

472
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,820
I want four men on each block.

473
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,190
Four men to go in.

474
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,230
Four on the left flank, four on the right.

475
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,660
- Sir? - Yes?

476
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,200
- Liebgott and I, we both speak German. - Yeah?

477
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,140
You said 15 men, there are 16 of us, including two translators.

478
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,770
Fine. Liebgott, you wanna sit this one out?

479
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,070
Yes, sir.

480
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,610
Martin, you wanna supervise the street squads?

481
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,220
- Thank you, sir. - Or the two fives?

482
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,690
Yeah, anyway...

483
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,190
Okay, you men going on patrol...

484
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,750
...Skinny, nothing rattles, nothing shines, no helmets.

485
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,800
Lieutenant?

486
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,780
Thank you.

487
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,690
Are you set for tonight?

488
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,020
I'm ready.

489
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,430
- Those Krauts are gonna catch some hell. - So I hear.

490
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,630
I'm not personally going in.

491
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,800
It's Martin, right?

492
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,110
Martin and McClung.

493
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,580
I'm supposed to stay in the rear and give them cover.

494
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,710
It's the best place to be.

495
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,130
Fifteen men crossing a river to capture prisoners from a German observation post.

496
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,300
Getting back safely could be successfully accomplished in as little as ten minutes.

497
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,370
The same mission could be met with disaster...

498
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,100
...and result in nothing more than 15 Americans killed or wounded in action.

499
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,740
Those of us who had seen combat before put that out of our minds.

500
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,050
Those who hadn't probably thought of little else as we waited for darkness.

501
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,050
- Any problems? - No problems.

502
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:39,360
It's secured to the tree. No sign of any AP mines.

503
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,990
Let's go.

504
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,200
Webster, come on.

505
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,610
Keep it steady.

506
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,150
Shit.

507
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,990
- I can't swim! - Garcia, grab Sisk.

508
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,470
Okay, keep going, come on. Stay focused. Come on.

509
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,500
Use the rope.

510
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,540
Come on.

511
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,380
Cutters.

512
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,090
Good.

513
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,090
To the side.

514
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,190
Let's go, come on.

515
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
Clear.

516
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,300
Easy now, clear.

517
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,520
Powers, go. Go, McClung.

518
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,230
McClung, move up.

519
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,890
In twos, up.

520
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,530
Powers, Wynn, secure the left flank.

521
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,100
Lieutenant...

522
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,440
...take Grant and Heffron secure the right perimeter and crossroads.

523
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,700
Clear?

524
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,800
Security out, go. Move.

525
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,810
Come on, let's go.

526
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,820
Jackson, hold on!

527
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,590
Let's go!

528
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,820
Jackson, wait!

529
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,040
Put it down!

530
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,770
Put it down, and keep your hands out where I can see them!

531
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,230
Keep those Krauts quiet!

532
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,680
Jackson!

533
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,150
Vest, take care of him.

534
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,740
Ramirez, watch Vest.

535
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,980
Let's go, Webster, let's go.

536
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,960
Split 'em up, come on.

537
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,360
Webster, check 'em for weapons.

538
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,790
Keep those men quiet!

539
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,430
McClung, cover 'em!

540
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,730
Take the charges, prime it, bury it.

541
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Shut up, you two, and pick him up.

542
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,910
McClung, these two are gonna carry the wounded Kraut.

543
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,640
Tell 'em. Bring the wounded man.

544
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,700
I said, shut up.

545
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,650
Ramirez, pick up Jackson! We're moving out!

546
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,550
Come on, where are you going? You, move!

547
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,480
Everybody moves out on my command.

548
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,250
Are you ready? Are you ready?

549
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,260
Shut up, you! Come on, we all go together.

550
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,720
Let's go, move, move out! Let's go, move! Move!

551
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,530
Webster, come on!

552
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,170
Powers, fall back, we're moving out!

553
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,180
Keep those prisoners' heads down, and let's keep moving.

554
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,180
Wynn! Fall back! We're moving out, let's go.

555
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,380
We're falling back! Covering fire!

556
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,560
Heffron, I want you to fall back now! Let's go!

557
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,130
Move out, get back to the boat, I'll cover.

558
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,260
Go!

559
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,670
Keep those men moving!

560
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,110
Lieutenant, take the whistle. Let's go!

561
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,450
Go!

562
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,280
Let's go!

563
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,890
Stay low, keep moving!

564
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,860
Fall back to the boats, now! Fall back!

565
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,090
Jesus Christ, come on, blow the goddamn whistle!

566
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,550
Okay, everybody, get in the boats, right now!

567
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,150
Come on, get in the boats.

568
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,280
Come on, move! Let's go, Shifty. I'm gonna shoot you, you fucking Kraut!

569
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,260
Shoot him, we'll have to come back for more.

570
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,160
You, in the boat, now! You get up, you Kraut piece of shit!

571
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,340
Into the boats! Quick, get in the boats, come on!

572
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,700
Let's go, we're moving out!

573
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,140
Let's get these boats in the water!

574
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,310
Let's do it, start pulling.

575
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,190
You're okay, Jackson!

576
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,220
Keep pulling!

577
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,640
Come on, keep going, come on!

578
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,740
Perconte, come on, let's go!

579
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,510
Where's the medic?

580
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,130
Everybody off the boats! Let's go!

581
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,760
Take cover!

582
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,960
We got wounded, come on.

583
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,510
Popeye, get the Krauts back there, and shake 'em down.

584
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,900
Move! Move!

585
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,440
McClung, McClung!

586
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,010
Get onto the company CP! Let 'em know what we got!

587
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,480
Shut up, just shut up.

588
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,880
I can't do this, I can't do this.

589
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,890
Move off. Webster, stay with him.

590
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,950
Hey, Shifty, watch Vest.

591
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,660
Sir, I'm going to get a medic.

592
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,530
- You got this? - Yeah.

593
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,770
- Get his legs. - Jackson, listen to me.

594
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,210
Calm down, or we can't help you.

595
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,710
Settle down.

596
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,510
He's gonna fucking die!

597
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,880
Jackson, look at me, don't listen to him.

598
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,820
Look at me. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay.

599
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,050
Keep still. Be calm, buddy, everything's fine. Everything's fine.

600
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,530
Goddamn it!

601
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,560
Jesus!

602
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,990
You think you're out of this war? What do you think you're doing?

603
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,630
We're not gonna get more prisoners, because you killed one!

604
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,270
Private, listen to me, Private. He's gonna fucking die!

605
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,140
Sit down! Jackson, stay calm, the medic is coming.

606
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,550
- They're on their way. - Where the fuck is the medic?

607
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,180
Doc is on his way.

608
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,980
- You'll be okay. All right, - Jackson, you got the doc.

609
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,050
- Doc's here, you're okay. - All right, Jackson, take it easy, okay.

610
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,120
Okay.

611
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,470
Light, I need some light, give me some light.

612
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,770
All right, look at the flame, Jackson.

613
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,530
Okay, that's good.

614
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,110
All right, let's get him out of here.

615
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,510
You guys, help the doc move him.

616
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,280
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die!

617
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,080
- It's okay, Jackson. - I don't wanna die!

618
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,010
Take it easy.

619
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,120
It's okay, it's okay.

620
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,320
You're all right. Jackson!

621
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,690
- God, my God! - Jackson, you're not gonna die.

622
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,700
You're not gonna die, I need you to hang on!

623
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,000
Jackson!

624
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,110
Eugene Jackson was 20 years old.

625
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,840
He'd lied about his age when he joined the army at 16.

626
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,150
His family, I'm sure, got a telegram...

627
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,210
...from the War Department, saying he died a hero...

628
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,120
...on an important mission that would help win the war.

629
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,330
In fact, Eugene lost his life on a stretcher in a dank basement in Haguenau...

630
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,270
...crying out in agony while his friends looked on helplessly.

631
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,330
He was just one more casualty in a war that was supposed to be all but over.

632
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,010
Did they put that in the report on the ADA?

633
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,080
We're working on it. How long are you gonna keep...

634
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,160
Keep moving, go on.

635
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,760
Get up on the truck.

636
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,060
Up, up.

637
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,060
Status?

638
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,070
Private Jackson took a grenade fragment from the enemy OP.

639
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,910
It was his own grenade.

640
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,200
He died of his wounds, sir.

641
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,650
Any others?

642
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,380
No, sir.

643
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,040
Well executed.

644
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,220
It's not your fault.

645
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,020
Talk to your men.

646
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,090
- Carry on. - Thank you, sir.

647
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,620
We heard you got two prisoners.

648
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,460
Good work.

649
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,090
Jackson's dead.

650
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,430
Yeah, we heard.

651
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,170
They want another patrol tonight.

652
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,560
What are you doing, Cobb?

653
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,930
You leave someone on the bank?

654
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
Yeah, yeah, we did.

655
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,140
It's the third prisoner that was too far-gone to bring back.

656
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,810
Maybe we should put him out of his misery.

657
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,520
Fuck his misery.

658
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,810
I can't listen to it anymore.

659
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,160
- Sir, want cigarette? - Yeah.

660
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,670
Who's got a light?

661
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,100
Here, sir.

662
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,210
Twenty-two.

663
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,750
What you looking at, Webster?

664
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,950
Yeah, that's what I thought, college boy.

665
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,960
Are you drunk, trooper?

666
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,890
Leave me alone.

667
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,900
Answer the question.

668
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,760
Yes, sir, I am drunk, sir.

669
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,170
Drunk.

670
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,840
Sick and tired of fucking patrols, taking orders...

671
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,840
Hey, Cobb, shut up. It's boring, okay?

672
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,780
Taking his side, Johnny?

673
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,590
Yeah...I am.

674
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,890
- So, he knows we lost a man? - Yeah, he knows.

675
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,920
He also knows you picked up two prisoners who talked.

676
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,390
About what?

677
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,660
OB, supply trouble, Hitler's favorite color.

678
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,390
I don't know. None of it gets us across the river.

679
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,130
What's the point?

680
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,930
Honestly?

681
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,600
Sink's been on the phone all day, bragging it up.

682
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,140
I think he's just showing off now.

683
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,610
I don't know, Dick. I don't know what to tell you.

684
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,120
You gave him a successful patrol, now he wants two.

685
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,580
Successful.

686
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,010
Sir, the men are mustered.

687
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,820
If you want me to brief 'em, I'm gonna.

688
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,680
It's the same roster as last night.

689
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,530
Well, mostly.

690
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,440
- Evening, gents. - Evening, Colonel.

691
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,200
At ease.

692
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,910
Y'all did a damn fine job on a tough mission last night.

693
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:37,420
And I wish you good luck tonight, 'cause I'll be expecting more of the same.

694
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,680
- Have you briefed the men? - Just on our way, sir.

695
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,190
All right.

696
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,580
Make damn sure you remind 'em how proud I am of what they did.

697
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,960
Yes, sir.

698
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,560
So, I'll brief 'em now, sir?

699
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,000
No.

700
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,730
No, I'll do it.

701
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,820
Sarge, they're on their way in.

702
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,190
Ten-hutt.

703
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,520
- Martin. - Sir.

704
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,590
At ease.

705
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,460
- This everybody, Grant? - Sir.

706
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,500
You men did an excellent job last night.

707
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,462
I...

708
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,340
I'm proud.

709
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,640
I just saw Col. Sink. He's proud, too.

710
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,710
In fact, he's so proud, he wants you to do another patrol across the river tonight.

711
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,580
Any moment now, the outpost we hit last night...

712
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,060
- ...will go up in flames, Martin? - Yes, sir.

713
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,890
It means we'd have to venture farther into town this time.

714
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,990
- Capt. Speirs, you have the map, please? - Yeah, Sgt. Grant.

715
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,870
We have enemy movement here and here...

716
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,140
...which means this is our new house target here.

717
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,370
We recovered all the boats so we'll set off from the same place as last night.

718
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,080
We're not changing the plan any, sir?

719
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,720
No. Plan is the same.

720
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,160
It will be 0200 hours instead of 0100.

721
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,760
- Is that clear? - Yes, sir.

722
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,900
Okay. Good, because...

723
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,730
...I want you all to get a full night's sleep tonight.

724
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,870
Which means, in the morning you will report to me that you made it across the river...

725
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,880
...into German lines...

726
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,580
...but were unable to secure any live prisoners.

727
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,660
Understand?

728
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,430
Yes, sir.

729
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,730
Good.

730
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,910
Look sharp for tomorrow.

731
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,030
We're moving off the line.

732
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,950
- Did I fucking hear that right? - A good man.

733
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,110
Moving off the line.

734
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,850
It's a whole new way to fight a war.

735
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,490
Don't bother writing this up. I'll take care of it.

736
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,400
- I might actually enjoy it. - Okay.

737
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,230
Think you might be onto something, Dick.

738
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,240
- Lt. Jones. - Sir.

739
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,370
Join us at the company CP.

740
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,750
- First Sergeant Lipton. - Sir.

741
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,990
Your honorable discharge as an enlisted man.

742
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,460
Just keep 'em coming, Luz.

743
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,430
Battlefield commission as Second Lieutenant.

744
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,020
- Look what we have here, boys. - Hey, pal.

745
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,370
- Congratulations, Carwood. - Thank you, sir.

746
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,700
- Lip, congratulations. - Thanks.

747
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,880
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, welcome back, sir.

748
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,500
- That's Harry to you. Congratulations. - Thanks, Harry.

749
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,550
Harry, I didn't expect to see you this soon.

750
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,640
I figured you'd be nursing that scratch for another month or two.

751
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,650
Did you miss me, Lewis?

752
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,550
Lt. Jones.

753
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,550
Regiment has seen fit to promote you to First Lieutenant.

754
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,630
They want you on staff up there.

755
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,160
- Congratulations and good luck. - Thank you, sir.

756
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,510
Dismissed.

757
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,670
Looks like you lost another platoon leader, Web?

758
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,490
So, a second patrol never happened.

759
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,990
Word was Capt. Nixon wrote up a bogus report...

760
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,390
...and regiment never got wise.

761
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,220
As we pulled out of Haguenau...

762
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,700
...many of us in Easy Company felt that a corner had been turned...

763
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,500
...and we all might make it home alive.

764
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,630
So, we'll know more as soon as we get closer to the line.

765
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,500
Before I forget...

766
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,410
...Col. Sink's unhappy with the appearance of your uniform.

767
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,240
He says it's not befitting to your rank.

768
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,290
Oak leaves.

769
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,360
Congratulations, Major.

770
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,030
Gentlemen, we're ready.

771
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,310
I'll drive.

772
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,570
- Sgt. Malarkey - Good luck, sir.

773
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,470
- Sgt. Martin. - Yeah, Lieutenant?

774
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,380
- Good work. - Thank you, sir.

775
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,220
- Good to have you along. - Good luck, men.

776
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,310
Here.

777
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,530
I wondered if people back home would ever know...

778
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,590
...what it cost the soldiers to win this war.

779
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,000
In America, things were already beginning to look like peace time.

780
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:09,370
The standard of living was on the rise, race tracks and nightclubs were booming.

781
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,440
You couldn't get a hotel room in Miami Beach, it was so crowded.

782
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,780
How could anyone ever know of the price paid by soldiers...

783
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,080
...in terror, agony, and bloodshed...

784
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,390
...if they'd never been to places like Normandy...

785
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,620
...Bastogne, or Haguenau?
