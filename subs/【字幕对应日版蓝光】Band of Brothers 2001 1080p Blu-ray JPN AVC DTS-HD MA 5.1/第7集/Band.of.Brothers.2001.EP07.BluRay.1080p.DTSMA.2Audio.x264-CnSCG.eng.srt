1
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,169
I've seen death, I've seen...

2
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:14,629
...my friends, my men being killed.

3
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,030
and

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,029
This is...

5
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:25,409
It doesn't take too many days of that and you change dramatically.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,080
We were hungry, we had no food...

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,350
...we didn't have ammunition, it was cold, didn't have any clothes.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,850
You couldn't build a fire.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,290
If you did, some crazy thing would shoot at you.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,850
Every where you would look, you would see dead people.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,800
A dead soldier there, here. Ours, theirs.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,070
Then civilians besides. Dead animals.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,610
So, death was all over.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:59,670
You don't have a chance when your friends go down to really take care of them as you might.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,820
And especially if you're under attack, moving, or whatever.

16
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,531
I withstood it well but...

17
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:15,161
...I had a lot of trouble in later life...

18
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:18,031
...because...

19
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:22,541
...those events would come back and...

20
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:25,341
You never forget them.

21
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,085
After holding the line at Bastogne...

22
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,555
...Easy Company was again called on to help push...

23
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,655
...the Germans back through the Bulge.

24
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:20,155
We were here this morning and then we came this way.

25
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:22,635
Right, so, right here's gotta be the logging road...

26
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,535
...coming into here, which means we get right there.

27
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,295
- Take it easy. - Stop crying, Malark...

28
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,775
...or I'll nail it to your head.

29
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:30,305
Good, it's made of wood.

30
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:32,915
- Guarnere, move them out, let's go. - Yes, sir.

31
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,746
2nd Platoon, let's go!

32
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,646
I was glad to be out of my foxhole and moving again.

33
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,976
Even if only to get warm.

34
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,546
Spread out. Keep your interval.

35
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:54,226
E Company was sent to clear the Bois Jacques the woods near the town of Foy...

36
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:58,536
...in preparation for what we knew would be the eventual assault on Foy itself.

37
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:02,176
I see it, Buck. Watch for mines.

38
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,606
During that 1,000 yard attack through the woods...

39
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:11,586
...we encountered German machine gun fire and had a couple of casualties.

40
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,416
But, for the most part, met little resistance.

41
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:26,597
Hoobler's run-in with the German officer on horseback...

42
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,757
...was the most dramatic moment of the day.

43
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,267
Halt!

44
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:42,547
Halt!

45
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,368
Shit.

46
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,948
Thank you.

47
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,528
Hoobler had been talking about getting a Luger since Normandy.

48
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:34,168
As we dug in, he went from foxhole to foxhole...

49
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,259
...telling everyone how he'd finally got one.

50
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,739
Down he goes, right out of the saddle, like a sack of potatoes.

51
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,439
Outstanding accuracy on my part, if I do say so myself.

52
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,739
- Which you do. - Which I do.

53
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,549
Hell, Shifty, I think maybe I could have even given you a run for your money.

54
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,319
No, I'm not a good shot.

55
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,249
Now, Dad, he was an excellent shot.

56
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,759
Excellent, I declare, he'd shoot the wings off a fly.

57
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,859
Lip, that German, what'd you think he was doing?

58
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,489
Probably a little recon.

59
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,329
He must have figured nobody would hear a horse.

60
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,959
- I think he was trying to get outta Dodge. - Yeah.

61
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,739
What happened to the horse?

62
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:11,399
I don't know, probably still running. Hope he's okay.

63
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,909
- You dug in? - Yeah.

64
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,280
Yeah, just thought I'd take a walk, shoot the shit.

65
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,410
You're a good shot, Hoob. Just glad you're on our side.

66
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,650
Thanks, Lip.

67
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,410
- Hey, Lip? - Yeah.

68
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,020
- Thanks for the help. - You got it, Shifty.

69
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,430
- Lip? - Yes.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,550
- You got a sec? - Yes, sir.

71
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,460
Give him a hand.

72
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,570
- Where's Dike? - He's around.

73
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,630
Could you be more specific, Sergeant?

74
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,540
Not really, sir.

75
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,200
I haven't seen him all day.

76
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,940
Didn't see him in the woods...

77
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,040
...and I have to figure out how we ended up.

78
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,310
- Two wounded. - Who?

79
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,250
- Brown and Stevenson. - Goddamn it.

80
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,251
Where's Dike? Where the hell is he? Where does he ever go?

81
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,161
I don't know, but I wish he'd stay there.

82
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,961
Be nice if he took Lieutenant Shames with him.

83
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,361
- Shut up, boys. - Shutting up, Sarge.

84
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,971
What the hell is that?

85
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,901
- Patrol? - No, we would have heard.

86
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,041
- One man, maybe a sniper. - That was no rifle.

87
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,141
What do you see, Shift?

88
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:23,901
Nobody out there.

89
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,211
Are you sure?

90
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,611
Jesus, it's Hoob, he's shot.

91
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:31,351
- Sniper? - No, he shot himself.

92
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,791
- Stupid. - Medic!

93
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,791
- What happened? - Doc.

94
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,731
- Is he all right? - It's my fucking leg.

95
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,762
- He did what? - It just went off.

96
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,302
- What happened? - It just went off.

97
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:43,032
Why is there a loaded gun in your pants?

98
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:46,002
- Buck, I wasn't touching it or nothing. - Goddamn it.

99
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,702
- I wasn't touching it, I swear. - Medic!

100
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:49,902
Where are you hit, Hoob?

101
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:51,672
- Where are you hit? - In my leg.

102
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:54,212
Hold on.

103
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:57,542
Now, don't look. It's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it. Come on.

104
00:08:57,622 --> 00:09:01,182
It hurts like a son of a bitch. I think maybe I hit bone.

105
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,692
Doc!

106
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,382
Don't worry about it. You'll be all right.

107
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,792
Warm him up.

108
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,222
Can you hear me?

109
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,922
- Somebody keep him warm. - Sergeant.

110
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:14,292
- Let me see it. - Hang in there.

111
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,492
Warm up some blankets or something for him.

112
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:17,802
You're gonna be fine.

113
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,773
Keep talking to him.

114
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,903
Okay, listen to me.

115
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,943
- Think it was a German leg? - Yeah, right.

116
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,813
You're gonna be fine.

117
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,883
Hold on. Perconte, put this across him.

118
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,413
Wrap him up.

119
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,083
Hang in there. Come on.

120
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:39,253
Lip. You said I was a great shot, right?

121
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,623
You're a great shot. Come on, you jump out of planes.

122
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:45,493
You're tough. He's still shivering.

123
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,263
It's not that bad at all, come on.

124
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,703
Stay with us. Hoob, take it easy.

125
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,433
What are we gonna do?

126
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,303
- How are we doing? - You're gonna be fine.

127
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:55,343
We've gotta get him to an aid station.

128
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:58,173
- Hold on tight. - All right, let's get ready to move him.

129
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,843
Take it easy. Stay there, Hoob.

130
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,984
Doc. Can't see anything

131
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:04,144
Doc!

132
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:13,624
Jesus.

133
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,094
Perco, we need a jeep.

134
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:27,904
He was wearing so many clothes, we couldn't tell how bad he was bleeding.

135
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:31,104
By the time we got him to the aid station, he was already dead.

136
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,704
The bullet cut the main artery in his leg, sir.

137
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,374
Hell, Lip.

138
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:40,084
It wouldn't have made a difference if you had known.

139
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,285
Cut that main artery in the leg, that's it.

140
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,555
Yes, sir.

141
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:48,555
I'm gonna go back and make sure the boys are all dug in, sir.

142
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,055
Lip.

143
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,765
Where's Dike?

144
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,275
You wanna see him, sir?

145
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:59,705
No, I just would have expected to get this kind of news from him.

146
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,935
I was there, sir.

147
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:04,875
I figured it might as well be me.

148
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,425
"Where's Dike?"

149
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,985
I probably heard that question 1,000 times.

150
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,966
I probably asked it a few times myself.

151
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:29,066
There were long stretches where we didn't know where Lieutenant Dike was.

152
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:32,606
He'd disappear, go off on these walks for hours at a time.

153
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,506
Wouldn't have been so bad if he was just one of the guys in the company...

154
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:39,606
...but Lieutenant Dike was supposed to be leading the company.

155
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,686
Captain Winters was a CO we could all respect.

156
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,926
Moose Heyliger probably would have done a good job...

157
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:51,896
...but before we got a chance to find out, he was accidentally shot by a sentry.

158
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:54,326
Then came Norman Dike.

159
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:58,466
I want tight security around the company CP, Lieutenant Shames, that understood?

160
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,706
Dike wasn't a bad leader because he made bad decisions.

161
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,677
He was a bad leader because he made no decisions.

162
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:08,907
Now, Battalion S-3 is planning a move.

163
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:13,547
So, I will probably be called away regularly.

164
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:16,317
- Are there any questions? - Yeah.

165
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,517
What's the formation you want us to go for?

166
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:27,457
At present, as per usual, but I'll clarify that with you at a later time, Lieutenant Compton.

167
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:28,827
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,067
All right, I gotta make a call.

169
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,517
Let's move it out.

170
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,988
Dike was the favorite of somebody at Division.

171
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:54,688
He'd been sent down to E Company to get some combat experience.

172
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,758
Sometimes we got the feeling E Company was an annoyance to him.

173
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,228
Something he had to get through before he could continue his march up the ladder.

174
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,938
I'm telling you boys, we're screwed.

175
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,438
If you ask me, I'm glad Dike's never around.

176
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:09,538
You know what?

177
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:13,278
We're doing all right, even with Foxhole Norman.

178
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,938
Yeah, we're doing all right. We're doing all right now.

179
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,848
If you noticed, there's a little town down the hill.

180
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:21,888
In that town are these guys, and these guys are called Germans.

181
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,788
- And these Germans got tanks. - I know.

182
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:24,949
Yeah.

183
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,219
And our side's gonna wanna go into that town.

184
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,359
Guess who they're gonna want to go knocking on the goddamn doors.

185
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,029
I know, Bill, it's me you're talking to here.

186
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,169
Jesus Christ, we've gotta do all this with a CO...

187
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:44,009
...who's got his head so far up his ass that lump in his throat is his goddamn nose.

188
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,209
- Hey First Sergeant. - Boys.

189
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,409
- Sarge. - Lip.

190
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:49,579
Muck...

191
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,349
- ...what's the word? - You know.

192
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,149
Sitting around, freezing our ass off.

193
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,719
- Singing Dike's praises. - Yeah.

194
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,889
Lieutenant Dike.

195
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,199
I'll tell you...

196
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,730
...I wouldn't wanna be a replacement officer coming in here...

197
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,880
...getting thrown in with a group of guys who've known each other for two years.

198
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,210
They've been in combat together since Normandy.

199
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,540
You're supposed to just show up and lead them?

200
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,980
How's a guy do that?

201
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,680
How could anyone really hope to gain the respect of the toughest...

202
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,170
...most professional most dedicated sons of bitches in the entire ETO?

203
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,140
So, if you ask me, a guy'd have to march off to Berlin...

204
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,140
...and come back with Hitler's moustache or something.

205
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:51,941
Anyway, listen.

206
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:54,551
You guys, don't worry about Dike.

207
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,581
- All right? - Yeah.

208
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:00,121
We all do our jobs, everything will be fine.

209
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,661
- See you, Sarge. - Yeah, boy.

210
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:10,661
I don't know if I believed any of that...

211
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,001
...but as Company First Sergeant it was my job...

212
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,301
...not to protect Dike...

213
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,671
...but to protect the integrity of the company.

214
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:21,581
You know what Dike's problem is, don't you?

215
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:25,441
He's just another one of those arrogant, rich jerks from Yale.

216
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,781
God, not another one of those.

217
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:35,282
Division's not gonna let me replace him just 'cause I got a bad feeling about him.

218
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:38,732
Even if they would, who'd I put in his place?

219
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:41,422
Shames?

220
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:44,022
Do not ever talk when I'm talking, you got that?

221
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,832
He's seen too many movies. Thinks he has to yell all the time.

222
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:51,432
Both of you little crapheads did not listen to a word I said during that briefing, did you?

223
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,272
Or Peacock?

224
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:57,372
God bless him, no one tries harder but he's not cut out to take men into combat.

225
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:01,842
I'm not gonna make him Company CO when I don't want him as a platoon leader.

226
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,822
What about Compton?

227
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,622
He's the only real choice.

228
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,123
Buck's a real combat leader, but, you know...

229
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:16,833
I want Easy Company to have at least one experienced platoon leader.

230
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,433
Not that it matters anyway 'cause I can't get rid of Dike.

231
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:24,673
Well...

232
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:27,303
...we all know who you'd like to have running Easy.

233
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,343
Trouble is it's not your job any more.

234
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,113
We've gotta find somebody.

235
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,583
We all agreed Buck Compton would've been the best choice to run Easy...

236
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:47,193
...if Winters had been able to get rid of Dike.

237
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:50,494
But, to be honest...

238
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:54,034
...Buck wasn't the same soldier he'd been before he got shot in Holland.

239
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,804
He was more serious somehow.

240
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:58,034
He had a goddamn Luger in his pants.

241
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:00,584
Jesus. Dear God.

242
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:03,954
Don't you two do something stupid like that, all right?

243
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:06,414
- Try not to, Buck. - I mean it.

244
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:09,784
And you, Wild Bill...

245
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,194
...I've invested too much goddamn time...

246
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,324
...shaping you into something useful.

247
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:18,734
Do something crazy, get yourself knocked out of this thing...

248
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,324
I know, you'll kill me.

249
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,704
Even if you're dead, I'll still kill you.

250
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:27,704
I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna check on the other guys.

251
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,815
Crazy Joe McCloskey.

252
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:36,445
What?

253
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,455
This guy used to hang at the front of Delancey's and just...

254
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,185
...you know, just stare at people.

255
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,615
Yeah, I know who Crazy Joe McCloskey is.

256
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,325
What the hell's that got to do with anything?

257
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,885
Buck kind of reminds me of him now.

258
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,835
- What? - Ever since he got shot in Holland...

259
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,895
Wait.

260
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,465
What, are you saying he's nuts?

261
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,705
'Cause Crazy Joe McCloskey was fucking nuts.

262
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:03,975
- That's why they called him Crazy Joe. - No, I'm not saying he's nuts. I'm just...

263
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,235
What are you saying?

264
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:07,575
Forget it.

265
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,445
- What? - Forget it.

266
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,816
Come on, you've seen him, Bill.

267
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,686
He's all wound up like a spring.

268
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:16,626
He's fine.

269
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,996
It wasn't getting shot that got him, it was being in that hospital.

270
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,696
I've been there, okay?

271
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,996
It ain't pretty. Yeah.

272
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,176
Once he was up and moving around, he was his old self again.

273
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:38,446
I'm telling you, Buck Compton's fine.

274
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:43,176
- I'm serious. - Sure thing, Buck, nothing stupid.

275
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,276
- We got it, right? - We got it.

276
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:48,916
All right. George?

277
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:50,416
Yeah.

278
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,497
Nothing stupid, Buck.

279
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,207
Yeah.

280
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,077
"Don't do anything stupid"? Who the hell's he talking to?

281
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:07,637
Bunch of morons who volunteered to jump out of a perfectly good airplane.

282
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,207
- Can you get any more stupid than that? - Probably not.

283
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:11,307
Right.

284
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:15,347
- I swum across the Niagara once. - Yeah.

285
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,547
I swear.

286
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,417
On a bet.

287
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:21,927
What, in a barrel?

288
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,657
No.

289
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:27,157
I didn't go over the Falls, George. I swam across the river.

290
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,697
Ten miles up from the Falls. I tell you, that current is damn strong.

291
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:32,757
Yeah.

292
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,738
Must have carried me two miles downstream before I got across.

293
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,238
But, I got across.

294
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:41,478
Now, personally, I didn't think it was all that stupid but...

295
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,778
...my mom, my sister, Ruth...

296
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,818
...they gave me all kinds of hell.

297
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:48,618
- Yeah, I bet, Muck. - So did Faye.

298
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:53,348
- Sweet Faye Tanner. - Shut it, George.

299
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:56,488
Well, they had a point. You're an idiot.

300
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,579
I heard about Hoobler.

301
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,979
Shame.

302
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,079
Yes, sir.

303
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:24,619
It is.

304
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,889
- That the Luger? - Yes, it is.

305
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,529
What are you gonna do with it?

306
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,989
I don't know yet.

307
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:37,869
Where you from, Lipton? Where'd you grow up?

308
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,909
Huntington, West Virginia.

309
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,169
- Huntington? - Yes, sir.

310
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,369
I don't know it.

311
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,809
What kind of work did you do there?

312
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:53,019
My brother and I helped my mom run a boarding house.

313
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,720
And your father?

314
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,660
He was killed when I was 10, sir.

315
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,930
Automobile accident.

316
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,370
That's sad.

317
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,610
So, what made you decide to join the Paratroopers?

318
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,910
I read an article about paratroopers in Life magazine.

319
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,150
Talked about the training, how hard it was.

320
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,450
Said if you want to make it as a paratrooper you had to be the best.

321
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,820
And I wanted to fight with the best, sir.

322
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,550
You miss it?

323
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,260
Miss what?

324
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:36,961
Huntington.

325
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:43,801
Honestly, sir, I try not to think about it that much.

326
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,541
Where are you from...

327
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,891
Captain Nixon, sir.

328
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,361
- Captain Nixon, sir. - What?

329
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:17,341
Good morning, sir, sorry to disturb you. This came from Division.

330
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:23,012
All right.

331
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:30,752
- Morning. - Eviction notice? - Not quite.

332
00:22:30,822 --> 00:22:33,452
But I think this will help with your leadership problem.

333
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:36,362
- Dike's being transferred? - No, I can't help you with that...

334
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:38,762
...but Division has decided to pluck one officer...

335
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:42,292
...from each regiment that served in the heroic defense of Bastogne...

336
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:45,502
...send him back to the States on a 30-day furlough.

337
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,512
Get him out banging the drum for the war bond drive, that kind of thing.

338
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,002
It turns out I've been plucked.

339
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,440
Hey

340
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:59,042
- That's fantastic, Lew, good for you. - Thank you.

341
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:01,143
How in the world does your leaving help me?

342
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,653
It doesn't, I'm not going.

343
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:06,183
I've already seen the States, grew up there. That's why I came to Europe.

344
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,193
Just wish they'd told me there was a war on.

345
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,453
Anyway, the point is, this thing's wasted on me.

346
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,723
But, I'm sure we can find an officer somewhere...

347
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:15,493
...in this battalion who could use a long trip home.

348
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,733
Congratulations, Lieutenant Peacock.

349
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,963
I can't think of anybody who deserves this more.

350
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:22,233
Thanks.

351
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:27,673
I'm really glad that you're going home. Okay.

352
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:30,803
Best news I've heard in weeks. Hell of a guy.

353
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:34,043
Thanks, guys. It really means a lot, you know?

354
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,713
Get out of here.

355
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:41,353
Three cheers for Lieutenant Peacock. Hip hip hooray.

356
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:58,514
If they come by here, you all remember to smile for the camera.

357
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:01,174
Got to keep the morale up for them folks back home.

358
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:02,304
Why?

359
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:04,844
Damned if I know.

360
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,854
All right, Nix, what have they got waiting for us in Foy?

361
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:11,884
At least one company from the 10th Panzer grenadiers dug in here.

362
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:16,424
They've also got at least one 88 although we haven't been able to spot it yet.

363
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:20,064
- How about armor? - As of last night, three Tigers.

364
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,765
- Would you excuse me for a moment, sir? - Yeah.

365
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:25,495
How do I feel about being rescued by Patton?

366
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,075
I'd feel pretty peachy about it, if it wasn't for one thing...

367
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,745
...we didn't need to be fucking rescued by Patton.

368
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:34,645
You got that?

369
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:37,315
Joe. Excuse us for a moment.

370
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:41,385
- Sorry, sir. - Sorry about what?

371
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:42,655
Patton?

372
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,255
I couldn't agree more.

373
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:47,455
- What are you doing here? - I wanna head back to the line, sir.

374
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:51,335
You don't have to do that. Get yourself back to the aid station. Heal up.

375
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:54,495
I'd really like to head back with the fellas, sir.

376
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:59,205
All right, then go.

377
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:01,206
Thank you, sir.

378
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,146
Joe Toye had been at the aid station for three days...

379
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,446
...and everybody was glad to have him back.

380
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,686
Especially Bill Guarnere.

381
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,156
- Joe. - Bill.

382
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,696
- Good to see you, pal. - You, too.

383
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,256
What the hell you doing back here?

384
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:20,986
To make sure you're on top of things.

385
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:24,366
I'm on top of things. Tied me own boots once last week.

386
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:28,806
All by meself. Fellas, look who I found.

387
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,536
- Joe Toye, back for more. - How are you, Joe?

388
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:35,096
Yeah, doing pretty good. Escaped from the aid station.

389
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:37,666
- Where'd you get hit? - What's that?

390
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,776
- It's Webb. Replacement. - Really?

391
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:44,217
Thought it was some guy I've known for two years and I forgot his face.

392
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:48,277
Joe got hit in the arm. New Year's Eve gift from a luftwaffe.

393
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:51,827
- A lot of you guys been injured? - It's called wounded, peanut.

394
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,297
Injured's when you fall out of a tree or something.

395
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,337
Don't worry, there's enough crap flying around here.

396
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,097
You're bound to get dinged sometime.

397
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,697
Almost every single one of these guys has been hit at least once.

398
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,767
Except for Alley, he's a two-timer.

399
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:07,137
He landed on broken glass in Normandy...

400
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,547
...and got peppered by a potato masher in Holland.

401
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:10,637
You'll find out, son.

402
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:14,207
Now, Bull, he got a piece of exploding tank in Holland.

403
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:17,957
And George Luz here has never been hit.

404
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:20,887
- You're one lucky bastard. - Takes one to know one, Skip.

405
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:25,457
- Consider us blessed. - Now, Liebgott, the skinny little guy...

406
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,328
...he got pinged in the neck in Holland.

407
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:30,058
Right next to him, that other skinny guy, that's Popeye.

408
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,728
He got shot in his scrawny little butt in Normandy.

409
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:38,008
And Buck got shot in his rather large butt in Holland.

410
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:41,278
Yeah, kind of an Easy Company tradition, getting shot in the ass.

411
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:44,548
Even First Sergeant Lipton over there...

412
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:47,918
...he got a couple of pieces of a tank shell burst at Carentan.

413
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,478
One chunk in the face.

414
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,828
Another chunk almost took off his nuts.

415
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:56,218
- How are those nuts, Sarge? - Doing fine, Bill.

416
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,758
Nice of you to ask.

417
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,328
On the afternoon of January 3...

418
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:07,569
...most of E Company headed back to our old position in the woods overlooking Foy.

419
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,569
A few men remained in the Bois Jacques attached to D Company to hold the main line of resistance.

420
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:14,909
Good luck, ladies.

421
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:18,249
Been nice knowing you.

422
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:21,119
Wouldn't drink too much if I were you.

423
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,919
- Be careful if he offers you a cigarette. - What are they talking about?

424
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:27,619
- If who offers us a cigarette? - Speirs.

425
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,929
- Who? - Lieutenant Speirs.

426
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,299
Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was one of the platoon leaders in D Company.

427
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,839
He was already a legend.

428
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,369
The stories about Speirs are probably all bullshit anyway.

429
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,999
What stories?

430
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,470
What stories?

431
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,010
Supposedly Speirs shot one of his own men for being drunk.

432
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,350
You're kidding.

433
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,110
That's unbelievable.

434
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,860
Yeah, and there's another one about him giving cigarettes...

435
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,050
...to 20 German POWs before killing them.

436
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,500
- He shot 20 POWs? - Actually, I heard it was more like 30.

437
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,830
- Christenson. - Lieutenant Speirs.

438
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,430
- I got the name right, didn't I, Christenson? - Yes, sir.

439
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,810
What are you men doing out here?

440
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,370
We're watching the line, sir.

441
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,310
Keep up the good work. You might wanna reinforce your cover.

442
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,410
Lieutenant Dike said not even to bother. That we're only gonna be here one day.

443
00:28:25,491 --> 00:28:27,251
Lieutenant Dike said that?

444
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,231
Then forget what I said.

445
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,561
Carry on.

446
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,241
Anyone care for a smoke?

447
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,571
You?

448
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:51,241
Late in the afternoon on January 3...

449
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,411
...we returned to our old position in the woods overlooking Foy.

450
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,611
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

451
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:01,821
Someone's gonna die. Someone's gonna fucking die.

452
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:03,551
Guarnere, look at this shit!

453
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:07,091
One of those 1st Battalion fuckers took a dump in my foxhole.

454
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,162
I think they shit in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

455
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:15,362
I don't think they wanted to spend much time above ground.

456
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,272
While we were in the Bois Jacques...

457
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:21,672
...the Germans had been shelling our old position.

458
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:23,772
There were signs of tree bursts everywhere.

459
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:25,642
That got our attention.

460
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:27,682
Light and noise discipline.

461
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,652
We're getting close.

462
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:42,192
Looking across the field at Foy, I could see enemy troops.

463
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,372
I still couldn't see their artillery, but I knew it was down there.

464
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:53,773
Looks like the Krauts have been pounding this area with pretty big stuff, 88s.

465
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,543
I'd say they got this whole stretch of the line targeted.

466
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,483
- They're not shelling now. - Maybe they've got a new target...

467
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:00,813
No, they're just waiting.

468
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:03,513
- For what? - For us to reoccupy the position.

469
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,713
Maybe we should fall back and dig in.

470
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:07,953
No, it's our job to hold the line here.

471
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,693
We've got pretty good foxholes. We just need to fortify the covers.

472
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:15,203
- If they've got us targeted, maybe... - We hold the line here.

473
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:16,663
Sergeant Lipton's right.

474
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,903
We're gonna strengthen our covers and we're gonna hang in.

475
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:22,033
We're not gonna fall back.

476
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,043
Right, Lieutenant?

477
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,584
- Right, Lieutenant? - Fine.

478
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:32,654
You all take care of it.

479
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,784
I gotta go talk to Regiment.

480
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:40,524
We'd better get moving. Yeah.

481
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:46,404
- Here you go, Bill. - Thanks, Lip.

482
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:49,734
- I'll get you some more branches. - I'd appreciate that.

483
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:15,695
Incoming!

484
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:17,425
Take cover!

485
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,365
Take cover!

486
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:29,245
Take cover! Come on, find some cover!

487
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,045
They got us zeroed!

488
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:35,075
Find some cover, find a foxhole!

489
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,745
Come on, take cover!

490
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,785
Take cover!

491
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:46,795
Come on, find some cover!

492
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:52,126
Take cover!

493
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:54,926
Shit.

494
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:07,146
Come on, find some cover!

495
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,916
For some reason, at that moment, in that half-finished foxhole...

496
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:22,026
...all I could think about was the Fourth of July when I was a kid.

497
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:25,896
I loved to make my own firecrackers, cherry bombs, ladyfingers.

498
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:30,176
I loved to blow up dirt clods and pop bottles and the like.

499
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:32,137
Looked forward to it all year long.

500
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,947
What I saw that day was the most awesome...

501
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:38,177
...and terrifying display of firepower I'd ever seen in my life.

502
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:43,417
Of course, I wouldn't have been laughing if I'd known what happened to Joe Toye.

503
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:47,578
- Maybe we should see if anybody's hit. - Malark, that's what they want.

504
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:50,258
The Krauts are trying to draw us out in the open.

505
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,439
Stay in your foxholes. Stay in your foxholes!

506
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,299
Are you okay, can you walk? Come on, find a foxhole, come on.

507
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,069
I gotta get up.

508
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,909
I gotta get up.

509
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:20,749
I gotta get up.

510
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,449
I need my helmet.

511
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,989
I need help!

512
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,929
- You hear that? - Is that Joe?

513
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,560
Help!

514
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,960
Yeah, I think that's Joe.

515
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,900
Stay.

516
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,710
Stay down!

517
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,180
Stay in your foxholes!

518
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,380
Help!

519
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,840
Help, anyone there?

520
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,190
- Jesus. - I gotta get up.

521
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,050
I gotta get up.

522
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,090
Shit.

523
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,730
Come on, Joe. Come on, buddy.

524
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,630
Come on, pal.

525
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,000
You said you'd get back to the States before me.

526
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,510
You ain't going anywhere, you're all right.

527
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,781
I gotta get my helmet.

528
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:18,611
- Forget it. - I gotta get my helmet.

529
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,011
Anyone there?

530
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:21,951
- Hang on. - Help!

531
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,791
- Who's that? - It's Heff.

532
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,891
Come on, get me out of here, Lip.

533
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,491
Come on.

534
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,161
I got you.

535
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,391
Come on, Joe, I got you.

536
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,131
Come on, Joe.

537
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,301
Hang on.

538
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,471
Are you okay? Come on.

539
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:53,211
Think I overdid it on the cover for my foxhole?

540
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,081
Incoming!

541
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:00,452
Take cover!

542
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,032
Come on!

543
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,432
Hurry up, Guarno, you're gonna get bombed!

544
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:16,802
Come on! Move it, Bill!

545
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,242
Come on, Joe.

546
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,602
Hold on, I'll be there, I'm gonna help you.

547
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,752
No!

548
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:30,622
Medic!

549
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:40,033
During the second barrage, I wasn't laughing anymore.

550
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:19,904
Lip!

551
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,704
Are you okay?

552
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:28,734
Stay down!

553
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:31,474
You stay down!

554
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,014
First Sergeant Lipton?

555
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,484
You get things organized here.

556
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:37,124
I'm gonna go for help.

557
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:43,494
What the fuck?

558
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,664
- Lip, where the fuck's he going? - I don't know.

559
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,464
Get Battalion on the line. Tell them to notify BAS.

560
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:54,974
Battalion's up, Lip.

561
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,715
Medic!

562
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:21,455
Stay ready.

563
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,975
Sons of bitches might be trying to come through.

564
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,095
- You okay, One Lung? - Sergeant!

565
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:29,635
- How you doing, Popeye? - 100 percent ready to kill Germans, Lip.

566
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:36,645
Okay, Joe.

567
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,486
- Doc, what can I do? - Hold this.

568
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,726
You got a smoke?

569
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:53,166
Jesus, what's a guy gotta do to get killed around here?

570
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,396
Bill, you're going first.

571
00:38:56,476 --> 00:39:00,466
- Whatever you say, Doc, whatever you say. - Over here, take this man.

572
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:05,176
- Lip, they got old Guarnere this time. - We got you, soldier.

573
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,306
Just lie back.

574
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:17,816
Take it easy. I told you I'd beat you back to the States.

575
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:20,487
Lip.

576
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,597
How's Buck?

577
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:29,127
Luz, how's Buck?

578
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,297
He's fine.

579
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:32,437
- You sure? - Yes, he's fine.

580
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:35,907
I think you should probably go talk to him now.

581
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,077
All right.

582
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:53,587
Some say Buck changed after he was shot in Holland.

583
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,787
Maybe.

584
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:59,037
I know something happened to him when he saw Toye and Guarnere on the ground.

585
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:13,748
On the report it said Compton was being taken off the line because of trench foot.

586
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:17,018
Didn't say anything about him losing his friends.

587
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,728
Buck was a great combat leader.

588
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:30,868
He was wounded in Normandy, and again in Holland.

589
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:35,028
He received the Silver Star for his part in taking out those German guns on D-day.

590
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:38,238
He took everything the Krauts could throw at him time and again.

591
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:41,208
Lieutenant Compton?

592
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,239
"UCLA did not make the Rose Bowl this winter.

593
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,289
"Probably because you weren't there.

594
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,659
"I'm sure you're teaching all of your young soldiers...

595
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:52,489
"...the joy you have of the sport.

596
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:56,529
"Gosh, how we all know what an exciting young man you are...

597
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,759
"...and how your heart and love..."

598
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:06,769
I guess he just couldn't take seeing his friends Toye and Guarnere torn up like that.

599
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:10,569
No one ever thought any less of him for it.

600
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,519
Hey Bull.

601
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,820
With Buck off the line, there was no longer any possible alternative to Dike.

602
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,890
At least none we could see.

603
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,800
Thanks.

604
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,290
Muck.

605
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,130
- Muck. - Yes, Sergeant?

606
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm looking for Lieutenant Dike.

607
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,300
- We were stuck with Dike. - He's over there

608
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,000
And he was off taking a walk.

609
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,850
Sure thing.

610
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,940
Lightning Six, kidnap.

611
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,350
Yes, sir. We've cleared all the green area between...

612
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,550
We'd cleared the woods east of Foy.

613
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,560
So, a few days later, E Company and the rest of the 506...

614
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,390
...cleared the woods west of Foy.

615
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,460
There was little resistance.

616
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:12,031
You fellas know I got no reason to bullshit you, right?

617
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:15,271
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you. This is what I saw.

618
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:17,971
It was so unbelievable, you might not believe me.

619
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,371
So, you-know-who comes running up to Lipton.

620
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,381
He's got no helmet, no gear, no nothing.

621
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,321
First Sergeant Lipton, you organize things here...

622
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:27,881
...and I'm gonna go for help.

623
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,421
I need to go polish my oak leaf clusters.

624
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:34,691
- Luz - That's really good.

625
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,861
- It's okay - Fellas.

626
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:40,631
- Goodnight all. - Yeah, see you, Luz. - See you, Malark.

627
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:44,901
- What can I do for you, Sarge? - Two things, first, great impression of Dike.

628
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:46,842
You think so? I thought it was a little off.

629
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:51,172
No, you got it pretty good. Second, don't do it any more.

630
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:53,542
Especially the part about what he said to me.

631
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:55,622
It doesn't do anybody any good, okay?

632
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:58,582
- Yeah, I got you. - All right.

633
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,122
Wise ass.

634
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:11,932
Incoming!

635
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,853
Luz!

636
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:33,053
- Come on! - Hurry!

637
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:34,713
Luz!

638
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:38,953
- Stay down! - Come on!

639
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,193
Get in here! Come on!

640
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:47,403
- Come on! - Come on, Luz!

641
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:20,864
- Muck and Penkala! - What?

642
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:24,464
Muck and Penkala got hit!

643
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:33,354
Medic!

644
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:38,924
Medic!

645
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:43,694
It's my shoulder. Come on, get up!

646
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,535
Stay down till you get the all clear.

647
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:16,425
- Thought you didn't smoke. - I don't.

648
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:31,616
The shell that hit the foxhole Luz and I were in was a dud.

649
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:35,146
The one that hit Muck and Penkala's foxhole wasn't.

650
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:37,116
That's just the way it was.

651
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,946
Muck and Penkala were good men.

652
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,396
Their death hit Malarkey the hardest.

653
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:49,056
Malarkey's best friends in the Company had been Compton, Muck, and Penkala.

654
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:51,426
In less than a week, he'd seen two of them die.

655
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:57,276
- What's the word? - The men on the line are okay.

656
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,866
Food has just been resupplied. We're in good shape.

657
00:45:59,946 --> 00:46:02,706
Okay, we'll just hunker down. We might get some relief soon.

658
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:04,606
- Okay? - All right.

659
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:19,827
All right.

660
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:29,277
Later that day, we were back in our old position overlooking Foy.

661
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:31,847
We were all worried about Malarkey.

662
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,457
Malark.

663
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:45,887
Didn't I hear you say you wanted to bring a Luger home for your kid brother?

664
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:50,897
Yeah.

665
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:56,868
Why don't you...

666
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,078
Why don't you give him that?

667
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:05,578
- It's Hoob's, right? - Yeah.

668
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:09,088
Yeah, I was gonna get rid of it but I...

669
00:47:09,658 --> 00:47:11,248
I don't know.

670
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:14,488
Listen...

671
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:18,898
...Captain Winters was wondering if you wanted to go back to battalion and...

672
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:21,238
...work as his runner for a few days.

673
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:28,378
Tell him thanks, I'm gonna stay here.

674
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,908
Look, why don't you at least come back for an hour or so.

675
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:37,119
Say goodbye to Buck. I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.

676
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,159
All right.

677
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,339
You be careful with that.

678
00:47:50,669 --> 00:47:52,639
Getting even 50 yards back from the line...

679
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:56,839
...just for an hour or two could make a big difference in a soldier's state of mind.

680
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:03,739
The morning after the shelling that killed Muck and Penkala...

681
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:06,849
...I saw a soldier try to dig a foxhole with his bare hands.

682
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:07,909
Private.

683
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:09,889
Didn't notice he'd torn off his fingernails.

684
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:11,049
Private.

685
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,520
I got him out of there quickly.

686
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,660
Not for his sake, but for ours.

687
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,630
Fear is poison in combat.

688
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,430
It's something we all felt, but you just didn't show it.

689
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,560
You can't.

690
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,570
It's destructive and it's contagious.

691
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,110
- Told you I'd get you started. - We got a bleeder here.

692
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,810
Buck was never the same after seeing Toye and Guarnere get hit that day.

693
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,720
I guess he just needed some time away from it all.

694
00:48:56,901 --> 00:49:00,071
The barrages on January 3, and the shelling on January 9...

695
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:03,511
...marked the low point in the war for many of the men in E Company.

696
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,181
Even then, very few actually broke.

697
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:10,011
I knew the terror of those shellings and the pressure we'd been under...

698
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,141
...since we got to Bastogne could take their toll in other ways.

699
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:17,281
I was afraid the men would lose focus, suffer a drop in morale.

700
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:20,461
And that was dangerous, especially in combat.

701
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,901
More of which lay in store for us.

702
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:24,901
Perconte.

703
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,931
We'd cleared the woods east and west of Foy.

704
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:31,231
Now it was time for the inevitable assault on Foy, itself.

705
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:33,601
Frankly, I was dreading it.

706
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,172
I always knew the E Company men who trained at Toccoa...

707
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:37,842
...wouldn't survive the war unscathed...

708
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:42,042
...but now I was beginning to wonder if any of us were gonna make it through at all.

709
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,842
E Company would lead the attack.

710
00:49:44,952 --> 00:49:47,152
The problem was, at least in my estimation...

711
00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:49,522
...E Company still did not have a leader.

712
00:50:01,402 --> 00:50:04,462
The night before the attack, I did something as First Sergeant...

713
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,942
...I would never have imagined myself doing.

714
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,913
Lip.

715
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:21,463
- Didn't figure you for a smoking man. - Neither did I.

716
00:50:25,993 --> 00:50:28,933
D Company, Lieutenant Speirs, patrol order.

717
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:32,363
So?

718
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:35,103
We've been watching Foy all day, sir, not much activity.

719
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:38,093
- Want a coffee? - No, thank you, sir.

720
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:44,543
- How's Easy's status? - The men are good, sir, they're prepared.

721
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:46,843
I'm gonna be leading 2nd Platoon, tomorrow.

722
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:49,213
They're probably the weakest after losing Toye...

723
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:51,723
...and Guarnere, and Muck, and Penkala.

724
00:50:52,723 --> 00:50:55,353
But all in all, I have every confidence in the men, sir.

725
00:50:55,424 --> 00:50:56,554
Good.

726
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:05,004
But, on the other hand, I have no confidence in our CO, sir.

727
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:09,504
Lieutenant Dike is an empty uniform, Captain.

728
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:11,434
He's just...

729
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:14,114
He's not there, sir.

730
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:17,404
He's gonna be there tomorrow.

731
00:51:17,484 --> 00:51:19,974
Yes, sir, I understand he will be there physically.

732
00:51:20,684 --> 00:51:22,784
But tomorrow's gonna be the real deal...

733
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,184
...and he's gonna have to lead those men.

734
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,114
He's gonna have to make decisions, sir, and I...

735
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:33,554
I gotta tell you, sir, I think he's gonna get a lot of Easy Company men killed.

736
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:41,005
- Thank you, Sergeant, that'll be all. - Yes, sir.

737
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:48,715
I said what I had to say. There was nothing Winters could do.

738
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:55,485
He couldn't very well remove a company CO.

739
00:51:55,555 --> 00:51:57,025
Especially a well-connected one...

740
00:51:57,095 --> 00:51:59,925
...because of the misgivings of a company first sergeant.

741
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:05,025
There's an eighth of a mile of open field to cross before we get down here into Foy.

742
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:06,865
There's little cover, so move quickly.

743
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:09,425
There's two sections of light machine guns, either end.

744
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,835
They'll give you covering fire.

745
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:13,665
3rd Battalion will come from the east led by I Company.

746
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:15,005
That should cause distraction.

747
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:17,905
D Company will be in reserve but we shouldn't need them.

748
00:52:17,976 --> 00:52:19,806
You gotta move in there fast.

749
00:52:20,286 --> 00:52:24,016
Get in there before they can bring their mortars and artillery down on you.

750
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:26,446
- Clear? - Clear.

751
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:29,616
I'm relying on you. Get it done.

752
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,336
- Covering fire! - Let's go! Keep it moving!

753
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:52,206
Suppressing fire!

754
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:58,316
Keep moving! Move!

755
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:06,017
Let's go!

756
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,867
Suppressing fire! Fire!

757
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:14,527
Keep them tight, Shames.

758
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:19,237
Keep moving. Come on.

759
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:22,507
Krauts in the open!

760
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:28,507
- Keep moving! - Three inside!

761
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:34,087
Wait a minute, where's Foley?

762
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:36,157
Randleman!

763
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,587
Liebgott.

764
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,328
Where the hell is 1st Platoon?

765
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:48,108
- Hold up! - Keep moving!

766
00:53:48,278 --> 00:53:50,798
Easy Company, hold up!

767
00:53:50,878 --> 00:53:52,538
2nd Platoon, hold up!

768
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,178
- Will you move! - Get me Foley on the radio.

769
00:53:56,248 --> 00:53:59,378
- Get out of there! Move! - Sir, I think we should take cover.

770
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:01,888
Find some cover!

771
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:04,748
- Find some cover! - What?

772
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:07,348
Stay down!

773
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:11,298
- Easy Red, Easy Red. Easy Six. Over. - Six, Easy Red, go ahead.

774
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:15,088
Easy Red, Easy Red, stand by for the Six.

775
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:20,768
Foley, you get back here where I can see you, goddamn it!

776
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:25,569
1st Platoon, hold up. Take cover! Martin.

777
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,609
Come on, soldier, with me. With you, sir.

778
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:30,639
Fire!

779
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:34,349
Fall back!

780
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:38,959
- Take cover! - Goddamn it.

781
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,319
Go forward!

782
00:54:42,229 --> 00:54:45,029
- Herron, on me. - Move back.

783
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:49,499
- Stay on my ass. - Hold fast, 2nd Platoon.

784
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:53,299
- Follow Lipton! Take cover! - What are we doing, Lieutenant?

785
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:57,069
- Why are we stopped? - Fall back!

786
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:58,879
Roger, kidnap.

787
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:01,469
- Standby to Six, - Lieutenant, what's the plan?

788
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,780
I don't know!

789
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,540
You'd better get Dike on that radio to me now.

790
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,280
Lieutenant, what's the plan?

791
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,320
- Captain Winters, sir. - What's the plan?

792
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,120
Okay, Foley. Foley, you take your men...

793
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,750
...on a flanking mission around the village...

794
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,890
...and attack it from the rear.

795
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,100
Dike, we cannot stay here!

796
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,140
You want 1st Platoon to attack the village, by itself?

797
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,140
We will provide suppressing fire.

798
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,370
We're gonna be alone out there, Lieutenant.

799
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,500
We will provide suppressing fire!

800
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,780
Get going forward!

801
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:45,421
You need to talk to Captain Winters, sir.

802
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:51,201
Sir, okay, here it is.

803
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:55,171
We go on a flanking run in the back of the village and we attack from the rear.

804
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:58,501
Ramirez, two guys, take them, go. Find some cover behind the stable.

805
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:00,041
Go!

806
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:03,211
- Shit! - Jesus Christ.

807
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,511
Webb, move up, find cover!

808
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:18,551
Suppressing fire, now!

809
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:23,101
Perconte! I got you.

810
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:25,192
Give me some cover!

811
00:56:27,032 --> 00:56:28,902
How you doing, Perconte?

812
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:31,602
They shot me in my ass, Martin.

813
00:56:32,612 --> 00:56:35,202
- You're all right, stay down! - I think we lost five men.

814
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:38,212
Can you locate? The building with the caved-in roof.

815
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:40,112
The building with the caved-in roof.

816
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:50,352
Sir, we are sitting ducks here.

817
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:52,862
We have to keep moving!

818
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,402
You've got to keep moving!

819
00:56:55,802 --> 00:57:00,432
Dick! Captain Winters. Goddamn it, you do not go out there.

820
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:02,992
You're the Battalion Commander, now get back here!

821
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:07,273
Dick, I understand your attachment to Easy Company...

822
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:09,673
Speirs, get yourself over here!

823
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,173
Get out there and relieve Dike and take that attack on in.

824
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:19,513
Webb, fall back, you're too exposed.

825
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,623
Come on, Webb, let's go, kid.

826
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:30,963
- Hang on, Perco. - Fire!

827
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,563
Lieutenant, what are we doing?

828
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:41,133
I'm taking over. First Sergeant Lipton.

829
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,703
What have we got?

830
00:57:42,783 --> 00:57:44,843
Sir, most of the Company is spread out here.

831
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:48,854
1st platoon tried an end around but they're stretched out, pinned by a sniper.

832
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,884
I believe he's there at the caved-in roof.

833
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:53,484
Destroy that building with mortars and grenade launchers.

834
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,654
Then, I want 1st to go in, forget going around.

835
00:57:55,724 --> 00:57:57,254
- Everybody else, follow me. - Yes, sir.

836
00:57:57,324 --> 00:57:58,624
Thank God.

837
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:03,464
All right, 3rd Platoon, let's go!

838
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:07,334
All right, you heard the word, 2nd Platoon, on the CO!

839
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:09,174
- Sergeant Alley! - Got it, Sarge.

840
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:15,474
Okay, 1st Platoon, move out!

841
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:19,714
On your feet, 2nd Platoon. Move out!

842
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:23,184
Get on your goddamn feet.

843
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:26,084
Come on!

844
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:30,655
Come on, Luz, let's get the bastards.

845
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:33,895
Fire!

846
00:58:36,105 --> 00:58:38,165
Come on, move out!

847
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:42,445
- Fire! - Take cover!

848
00:58:42,505 --> 00:58:43,975
Fire!

849
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:48,705
- Go! - Go on, come on.

850
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:54,445
Take the cart out!

851
00:58:55,485 --> 00:58:56,925
Fire!

852
00:58:57,855 --> 00:58:59,115
Lipton.

853
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:02,595
Street fight, Item. Easy Six, over.

854
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:07,025
- What do you see, Lipton? - Armor and infantry, a lot of infantry.

855
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:09,266
I Company's should be on the other side of town.

856
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:10,566
Do you see any sign of them?

857
00:59:10,636 --> 00:59:12,406
- Radio, anything? - No, sir.

858
00:59:12,476 --> 00:59:14,236
Sir, I think they're gonna pull back.

859
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:16,006
We don't connect with I, they'll escape.

860
00:59:16,076 --> 00:59:18,476
- That's right, wait here. - Item, Item. Easy Six.

861
00:59:19,016 --> 00:59:20,536
What the hell?

862
00:59:32,496 --> 00:59:35,086
At first, the Germans didn't shoot at him.

863
00:59:36,526 --> 00:59:39,226
I think they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing.

864
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,626
But that wasn't the really astounding thing.

865
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:45,766
The astounding thing was that after he hooked up with I Company...

866
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,636
...he came back.

867
01:00:20,047 --> 01:00:22,037
We took over 100 German prisoners.

868
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:24,977
After that it was mostly clean up.

869
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:28,477
Let's go, move it, move it! Take them down to the barn.

870
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:34,958
Sit down.

871
01:00:38,628 --> 01:00:39,998
Sniper!

872
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,758
Take cover!

873
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:47,758
Come on.

874
01:00:48,808 --> 01:00:50,038
Where is he?

875
01:00:51,808 --> 01:00:54,138
Shit, I can't see him.

876
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,808
Second floor, building on the right.

877
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,948
Don't miss, Shifty. Now!

878
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,949
Over here. I need help over here. Hey, can you guys get over here and help?

879
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:33,309
Mellet, Herron, Sowosko, and Ken Webb were killed by a sniper.

880
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,579
There would've been more if it hadn't been for Shifty Powers.

881
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,410
- You hit bad, Perconte? - Beautiful wound, Lip.

882
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,540
They shot me right through my ass.

883
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,090
- You hang tough. - Sarge.

884
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,210
- Yeah? - Is it true about Dike?

885
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,450
Yeah.

886
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,820
Thank God for small mercies?

887
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,850
Yeah.

888
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,400
We'd been looking down at Foy...

889
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,110
...for the better part of a month, knowing that's where we had to go.

890
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:36,111
It was a great relief to have done it.

891
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,051
A lot of the men thought once we'd taken Foy they'd get off the line...

892
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:44,681
...ship us back to Mourmelon for a breather.

893
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:46,781
But that wasn't to be.

894
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:50,561
Two days later, we took Noville, and after that, Rachamps.

895
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,312
We spent our night in Rachamps, in a convent.

896
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:19,162
It was the first time we'd spent a night indoors in a month.

897
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,602
The sisters there brought in their choir to sing for us.

898
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,542
It was heaven.

899
01:03:43,752 --> 01:03:45,722
The mood of the men was relaxed.

900
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:49,022
We were finally being relieved and would soon be in Mourmelon.

901
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:53,892
Of course, in the morning we found out Mourmelon would have to wait.

902
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,293
Hitler had launched a counteroffensive in Alsace...

903
01:03:56,363 --> 01:03:59,593
...and we were bound for the town of Hagenau to help hold the line.

904
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,133
But at least for that night we didn't know it yet.

905
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,373
That night we were okay.

906
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:25,893
I spent that night trying to come up with a roster...

907
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,993
...for the Company, to see who we had left.

908
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:31,423
We'd come into Belgium with 121 men and officers...

909
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:33,233
...plus 24 replacements.

910
01:04:33,433 --> 01:04:37,533
That's 145 total. We were going out with 63.

911
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:43,544
Guarnere was badly wounded and Hoobler died accidentally.

912
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:49,314
Joe Toye had lost his leg.

913
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:58,024
Among the dead were Herron, Mellet...

914
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:01,224
...Sowosko, Kenneth Webb, Harold Webb...

915
01:05:01,304 --> 01:05:04,034
...Alex Penkala, and Skip Muck.

916
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:11,304
Our month in Belgium cost us one good officer, Buck Compton.

917
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,074
And one bad one, Norman Dike.

918
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:23,655
But we gained a good one in the end, so I guess we came out ahead.

919
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:35,695
What is it?

920
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:37,465
Nothing.

921
01:05:40,075 --> 01:05:43,135
I'd better get back to Battalion before they disappear.

922
01:05:51,085 --> 01:05:54,105
- You wanna ask me, don't you? - Ask you what, sir?

923
01:05:54,185 --> 01:05:57,055
You wanna know if they're true or not, the stories about me.

924
01:05:58,356 --> 01:06:00,416
Did you ever notice with stories like that...

925
01:06:00,496 --> 01:06:02,966
...everyone says they heard it from someone who was there...

926
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,866
...but then when you ask that person...

927
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:07,586
...they say they heard it from someone who was there.

928
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,936
It's nothing new, really.

929
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:14,196
I bet if you went back 2,000 years, you'd hear a couple of centurions...

930
01:06:14,276 --> 01:06:18,406
...yakking about how Tercius lopped off the heads of some Carthaginian prisoners.

931
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:24,876
Maybe they kept talking about it because they never heard Tercius deny it.

932
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:30,356
Maybe because Tercius knew there was some value to the men...

933
01:06:30,426 --> 01:06:33,986
...thinking he was the meanest, toughest, son of a bitch in the Roman legion.

934
01:06:35,596 --> 01:06:36,686
Sir?

935
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:42,267
These men aren't really concerned about the stories.

936
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:44,927
They're just glad to have you as our CO.

937
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:47,837
They're happy to have a good leader again.

938
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:50,307
From what I've heard, they've always had one.

939
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,437
I've been told there's always been one man they could count on.

940
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:57,177
Led them in Bois Jacques, held them together...

941
01:06:57,257 --> 01:06:59,587
...when they were shelled in the woods.

942
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:04,617
Every day he kept his spirits up, kept the men focused, gave them direction.

943
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:07,927
All the things a good combat leader does.

944
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:16,507
You don't have any idea who I'm talking about, do you?

945
01:07:16,737 --> 01:07:17,827
No, sir.

946
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:19,937
Hell, it was you, First Sergeant.

947
01:07:20,978 --> 01:07:24,638
Ever since Winters made Battalion, you've been the leader of Easy Company.

948
01:07:32,788 --> 01:07:36,658
And you're not gonna be first sergeant much longer.

949
01:07:36,728 --> 01:07:37,848
Sir?

950
01:07:39,258 --> 01:07:43,388
Winters put in for a Battlefield Commission and Sink approved on your behalf.

951
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:45,898
You should get the official nod in a few days.

952
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:51,768
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

953
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:16,929
Look, it's 1st Battalion.

954
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,099
What do you want?

955
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:23,069
Yeah, thanks for crapping in our foxholes, you shitheads.

956
01:08:23,139 --> 01:08:27,169
- It's our pleasure. - Enjoy the walk, boys.

957
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,690
There they go, Easy Company.
