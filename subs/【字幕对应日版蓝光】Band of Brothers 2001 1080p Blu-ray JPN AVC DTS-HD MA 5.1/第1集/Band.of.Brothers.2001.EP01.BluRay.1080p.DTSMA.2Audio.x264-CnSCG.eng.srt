1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,770
We were in a store and a guy in that store...

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,480
...told us to put our uniforms on.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,640
"what the hell are you talking about? "

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,120
He says, "The USA is in a war with Japan."

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,020
We couldn't believe it.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,150
Well, our country was attacked.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,460
It's different.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,400
It wasn't like Korea or Vietnam.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,960
We were attacked.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,670
And, you know, it was a feeling that...

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,210
...maybe, we're just dumb country people but...

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,440
...where I come from a lot of us volunteered.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,780
"Who would like to volunteer for the Tank Corps?

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,410
"Who would like to volunteer for the Air Force?

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,710
"Who would like to volunteer for the Navy? " or whatever.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,180
And then, they said:

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,650
"Who would like to volunteer for the Airborne? "

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,320
Somebody says, "What the hell's the Airborne? "

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,620
Nobody ever heard of it.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,990
We came from a small, small town.

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,230
And three fellows in that town that were 4F...

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,130
...committed suicide because they couldn't go.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,500
A different time.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,700
I did things.

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,600
I didn't do them for medals.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,480
I didn't do them for accolades. I did 'em because it's what had to be done.

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,580
The guy says, "would you jump out of airplanes?

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,310
"You know, you got all your army equipment...

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,220
"...and you jump out of airplanes, to fight the enemy."

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,520
These guys, they said, "Go to hell."

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,180
Nobody put up their hands.

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,230
And then, I don't know what it was brought it up...

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,190
...but the guy giving the speech was saying:

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,890
"But you get paid $50 a month more."

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,020
So, that made it a hundred bucks.

36
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,840
I want a whiff of chicken pie.

37
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,070
Okay, boys, let's get this gear stowed.

38
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,000
Fox Company...we go in five.

39
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,120
"In the name of the Father..."

40
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,160
1st Platoon, draw small arms.

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,020
Do you need a hand, Lieutenant?

42
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,560
Easy Company! Listen up!

43
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,460
Gather up around me.

44
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,970
Just move it up. Come on, gentlemen.

45
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,530
Let's go!

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,730
Now, the Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

47
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,400
High winds on the drop zone.

48
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,940
No jump tonight.

49
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,570
The invasion has been postponed.

50
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,609
We're on a 24-hour stand-down.

51
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,780
Son of a bitch.

52
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,580
Drill sergeants, take charge.

53
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,920
Well, this is quite a surprise.

54
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,290
Not particularly.

55
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,660
It so happens I rather expected it.

56
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, I can't see how you people can pass up $80,000 for the Cause

57
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,590
For whose cause?

58
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

59
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,070
...why don't you join the Army?

60
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,070
I think it's clearing up.

61
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,640
You think it's clearing up?

62
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,200
No.

63
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,440
I think it's clearing up.

64
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,140
How are your men?

65
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,780
They'll be fine.

66
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,320
5:00 in New York.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,480
4:00 in Chicago.

68
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,256
Happy hour, huh?

69
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,530
Yeah.

70
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,190
Happy hour.

71
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
A couple of drinks.

72
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,600
Maybe an early dinner before the theater.

73
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,100
A civilized place for civilized men.

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Should've been born earlier, Nix.

75
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,380
What, and give up all this?

76
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,370
We'll go to Chicago, I'll take you there.

77
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,340
Yeah.

78
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
We'll see.

79
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,050
Actually, you know who's from there?

80
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,490
Who? Oh, him.

81
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,150
712 days of that son of a bitch and here we are.

82
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,460
You people are at the position of attention.

83
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,505
Private Perconte, have you been blousing your trousers over your boots like a paratrooper?

84
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,506
No, sir.

85
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,740
Then explain the creases at the bottom.

86
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,200
No excuse, sir.

87
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,040
Volunteering for the Parachute Infantry is one thing, Perconte...

88
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,640
...but you've got a long way to prove you belong here.

89
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,810
Your weekend pass is revoked.

90
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,016
Name?

91
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,610
Luz, George.

92
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,650
Dirt in the rear side aperture.

93
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,120
Pass revoked.

94
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,200
When did you sew on these chevrons, Sergeant Lipton?

95
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,040
Yesterday, sir.

96
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,240
Long enough to notice this. Revoked.

97
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,540
Sir.

98
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,340
Name?

99
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,610
Malarkey, Donald G.

100
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,480
Malarkey

101
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,520
Malarkey's slang for bullshit, isn't it?

102
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,450
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,190
Rust on the butt plate hinge spring, Private Bullshit.

104
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,620
Revoked.

105
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Name?

106
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,360
Liebgott, Joseph D., sir.

107
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,190
Rusty bayonet, Liebgott.

108
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,460
You want to kill Germans?

109
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,600
Not with this.

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,270
I wouldn't take this rusty piece of shit to war.

112
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,640
And I will not take you to war in your condition.

113
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,150
Now, thanks to these men and their infractions...

114
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,980
...every man in the company who had a weekend pass...

115
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,650
...has lost it.

116
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,550
Change into your PT gear, we're running Currahee.

117
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,690
2nd Platoon, fall out.

118
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,790
We have two minutes.

119
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,920
Fall out!

120
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
I ain't going up that hill.

121
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,010
Perconte, what are you thinking of blousing your pants?

122
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,170
Shut up, okay?

123
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,340
He gigged everyone.

124
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,640
You should know better.

125
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,150
Don't give him no excuses.

126
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,410
Excuses?

127
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,610
Why don't you come here, look at these trousers...

128
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,520
...get down and tell me if there's a crease?

129
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,320
Let's go on the road in PT formation.

130
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,860
Let's move, move, move!

131
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,760
Perconte, let's go, Perconte.

132
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,330
Private White, why are you not in your PT gear?

133
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,730
I asked you a question, Private.

134
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,900
Oh, Easy Company.

135
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,330
While you're running, don't worry.

136
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,190
We'll take your dames to the movies.

137
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,830
Yeah, good, they need some female company.

138
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,300
Where do we run?

139
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,540
Currahee.

140
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,770
What does "Currahee" mean?

141
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,000
We stand alone.

142
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,610
How far up, how far down?

143
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,480
Three miles up, three miles down.

144
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,270
And what company is this?

145
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,750
Easy Company.

146
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,190
- And what do we do? - Stand alone.

147
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,250
Do not help that man! Do not help that man!

148
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,320
We do not stop.

149
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,760
You've got 30 minutes to get to the top of this mountain...

150
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,720
...if you want to serve in the Paratroopers.

151
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,730
Hi-ho, Silver!

152
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,820
You can make it up there.

153
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,630
Come on.

154
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,820
Come on, Alley, let's go.

155
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,030
Come on, Guarnere.

156
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,360
Christenson, come on.

157
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,930
I never thought I'd see the day, Private Wynn.

158
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,900
We are coming on 23 minutes.

159
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,530
That may be good enough for the rest of the 506...

160
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,450
...but that is not good enough for Easy Company.

161
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,160
We can make it, we can do this, come on.

162
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,220
I'm going to say something.

163
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,750
To who?

164
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,590
Lieutenant Winters.

165
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,060
What is it?

166
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,030
Permission to speak, sir?

167
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
Permission granted.

168
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,430
Sir, we got nine companies, sir.

169
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,230
That we do.

170
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,040
How come we're the only company...

171
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,510
...marching every Friday night, 12 miles, full pack in the pitch dark?

172
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,640
Why do you think, Private Randleman?

173
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,580
Lieutenant Sobel hates us, sir.

174
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,520
Lieutenant Sobel does not hate Easy Company, Private Randleman.

175
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,660
He just hates you.

176
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,860
Thank you, sir.

177
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,870
He hates him back.

178
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,230
He hates you, too, Muck.

179
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,940
Lieutenant Winters, I want canteens out of belts with the caps unscrewed.

180
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,980
Easy Company, canteens out and open.

181
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,240
On my command, they will pour the contents onto the ground.

182
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,840
On the CO's order, you will upend your canteen.

183
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,010
Now, Lieutenant.

184
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,140
Pour them.

185
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,480
Who is this?

186
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,820
Christenson.

187
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,190
Why is there no water in your canteen?

188
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,990
You drank from your canteen, didn't you?

189
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,254
Lieutenant Winters.

190
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:06,930
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Was this man ordered to not drink from his canteen during the Friday night march?

192
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,470
He was, sir.

193
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,330
Private Christenson, you have disobeyed a direct order.

194
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,600
You will fill your canteen...

195
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,170
...and repeat all 12 miles of the march immediately.

196
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,220
Yes, sir.

197
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,410
Fall out!

198
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,960
What in the name of God are you doing with my company?

199
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,400
You're late and you allow troopers to disobey direct orders?

200
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,800
No excuse, sir.

201
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,660
You're making me look bad, Lieutenant.

202
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,440
This is not Dog Company. This is not Fox Company.

203
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,100
This is Easy Company.

204
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,440
Under my command, this will be the first...

205
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,740
...and finest company in this regiment.

206
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,780
I want the names of six men.

207
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,590
Their infractions and your disciplinary recommendations on my desk by 0130.

208
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,920
Is that clear?

209
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
What infractions, sir?

210
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,790
Find some.

211
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,660
So, what'd you do?

212
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,610
Picked six men and gave them latrine duty.

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,240
The lucky six?

214
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,300
McDowell, Toye, Perconte.

215
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,580
Lipton, Muck and Guarnere.

216
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
Why them?

217
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,520
It was their turn.

218
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,350
Sobel's a genius.

219
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,650
I had a headmaster just like him in prep school.

220
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,950
I know the type.

221
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,420
Lewis.

222
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,120
Michelangelo's a genius, Beethoven's a genius.

223
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,990
You know a man in this company who wouldn't double-time Currahee with a full pack...

224
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,500
...just to piss in that guy's morning coffee?

225
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,430
Let's go, let's go.

226
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,740
Stand in the door.

227
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,600
1,000, 2,000.

228
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,270
You just broke both your legs, Private Gordon.

229
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,000
Are you trying to get killed?

230
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,450
No, sir.

231
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,950
Stand in the door.

232
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,290
Shit.

233
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,640
To the wall.

234
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,610
Over as a team.

235
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,510
Go on, against the wall.

236
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,910
Jesus, what the hell is this?

237
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,970
That's pig guts, boy.

238
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,680
Goddamn it!

239
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,860
Why are you here, Private Gordon?

240
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,020
To be in the Airborne, sir.

241
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,580
I don't believe you. Why are you here, Private Gordon?

242
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,030
To be in the Airborne, sir.

243
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,970
You have 50 minutes to the top and back, and I will be watching you.

244
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,560
What are you waiting for?

245
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,610
Easy Company has the finest performance record in the entire 2nd Battalion.

246
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,240
I believe every bit of that is thanks to you.

247
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,550
Congratulations, Captain Sobel.

248
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,880
Thank you, sir.

249
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,660
Isn't that Lieutenant Winters leading Easy Company in PT?

250
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,130
Yes, sir.

251
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,820
He's a damned good man.

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,230
I was planning on giving him a set of these today.

253
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,030
Why don't you do it? He'd be proud to get them from you.

254
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,610
Pornography, contraband.

255
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,510
Non-regulation clothing, contraband.

256
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,990
This man had 200 prophylactic kits in his footlocker.

257
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,660
How in the name of God was he going to have the strength to fight the war?

258
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,660
How is it Private Tipper...

259
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,490
...has spare time for so much correspondence?

260
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,800
Captain, are personal letters to be considered contraband?

261
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,070
These men aren't paratroopers yet, Lieutenant.

262
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,340
They have no personal property.

263
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,640
What is this?

264
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,420
Anybody?

265
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
It's a can of peaches, sir.

266
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,490
Lieutenant Nixon thinks this is a can of peaches.

267
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
That is incorrect, Lieutenant.

268
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,860
Your weekend pass is cancelled.

269
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,160
This is United States Army property...

270
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,100
...which was taken, without authorization, from my mess facility...

271
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,680
...and I will not tolerate thievery in my unit.

272
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,300
Whose footlocker is this?

273
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,970
Private Parks, sir.

274
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,380
Get rid of him.

275
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,850
All weekend passes are cancelled.

276
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,680
Officers included.

277
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,390
Carry on.

278
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,290
Lieutenant Winters.

279
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,140
Colonel Sink has seen fit to promote you.

280
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,310
As First Lieutenant, you'll serve as my executive officer.

281
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,680
Congratulations.

282
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,170
Thank you, sir.

283
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:06,250
And, as a test of your organizational skills and command potential...

284
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,490
...I am designating you mess officer for 14 days.

285
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,460
Report to the mess kitchen at 0515 hours.

286
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,330
Company breakfast to be served at 0600.

287
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes, sir.

288
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,900
And, Dick, there's rain forecast tomorrow...

289
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,970
...so the company will have a light afternoon of lecture and classroom instruction.

290
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,010
I think a special meal before their afternoon off...

291
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,750
...would be a welcome change of pace.

292
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,020
Would you agree?

293
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,990
Yes, sir.

294
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,820
I like spaghetti.

295
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,360
Hold on, more coming.

296
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,670
These guys are packing it away.

297
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,380
This stuff is orange.

298
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,910
Spaghetti ain't supposed to be orange.

299
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,220
This ain't spaghetti.

300
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,280
This is army noodles with ketchup.

301
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,290
You ain't got to eat it.

302
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,690
Oh, come on, Gonorrhea, as a fellow Italian...

303
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,360
...you know that calling this spaghetti is a mortal sin.

304
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,300
- I'll have it. - No, I'm eating here.

305
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,670
Hey, get out of here.

306
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,630
Orders changed, get up!

307
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,300
Lectures are cancelled.

308
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,710
Easy Company is running up Currahee.

309
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,300
Move, move!

310
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,070
Three miles up, three miles down.

311
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,020
Hi-ho, Silver!

312
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,550
Let's go, let's go.

313
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,820
You're a washout, Private Hoobler!

314
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,260
You should pack up both your ears and go home.

315
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,890
Looks like Gordon's done.

316
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,700
Aren't you, Gordon. You finished?

317
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,860
You do not deserve to get your wings.

318
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,910
Private Randleman, you look tired.

319
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,670
There's an ambulance waiting for you at the bottom of the hill.

320
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,970
It can all be over right now.

321
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,450
No more pain, no more Currahee.

322
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,880
No more Captain Sobel.

323
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,680
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

324
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,810
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

325
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,390
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

326
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,860
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry

327
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,160
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

328
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

329
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,730
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

330
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,140
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry"

331
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,850
So, do we feel like we're ready to be army paratroopers?

332
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,120
Yes, Sergeant.

333
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,530
I hope so.

334
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,270
This'll be the first of five exits from a C-47 aircraft scheduled for today.

335
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,060
Get ready!

336
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,910
Stand up!

337
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,410
Hook up!

338
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,410
Upon successful completion of your fifth and final jump...

339
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,474
...you'll be certified army paratroopers.

340
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,950
Check equipment!

341
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,780
Sound off for equipment check!

342
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,550
Nine okay.

343
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,780
Eight okay.

344
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,980
Seven okay.

345
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,150
Six okay.

346
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,030
Five okay.

347
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,560
Four okay.

348
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,930
Three okay.

349
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,860
Two okay.

350
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,920
One okay.

351
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,700
There'll be a lot of men dropping from the sky today.

352
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,700
Hopefully, under deployed canopies.

353
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,500
Stand in the door!

354
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,010
I guarantee you're going to love it, Lieutenant.

355
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,880
Go, go!

356
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,920
Jumping from 1,000 feet AGL...

357
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,320
...in sticks of 12 jumpers per aircraft.

358
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,920
All you have to do is remember what you were taught...

359
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,190
...and I guarantee you, gravity will take care of the rest.

360
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,320
Go, go, go, go!

361
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,930
Go, go, go!

362
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,040
Go, go, go!

363
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,200
Damn it.

364
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,600
And, gentlemen, rest assured...

365
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,270
...any refusals in the aircraft or at the door...

366
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,510
...and I guarantee you, you will be out of the Airborne.

367
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,010
Four okay.

368
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,150
Three okay.

369
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,880
Two okay.

370
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,750
One okay.

371
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,590
Stand in the door.

372
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,420
Go!

373
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,400
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000...

374
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,000
...7,000, 8,000, 9,000!

375
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,740
Hi-ho, Silver!

376
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,560
Now just think, if you had any class or style like me...

377
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,690
...somebody might mistake you for somebody.

378
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,730
You mean like your fucking sergeant?

379
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,990
I'm just kidding.

380
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,240
Congratulations, Martin.

381
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,300
Corporal Toye, there will be no leaning in my company.

382
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,140
Are those dusty jump wings?

383
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,070
How do you expect to slay the Huns with dust on your jump wings?

384
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,750
Luz, just give me a drink.

385
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,620
Hell of an idea, Joe.

386
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,250
There you go.

387
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,990
Three miles up, three miles down.

388
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,230
Ten-hut!

389
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,540
Well, at ease, paratroopers.

390
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,870
Good evening, Easy Company.

391
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,570
Evening, sir.

392
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,310
Now, Parachute Infantry is a brand-new concept...

393
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,040
...in American military history.

394
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,050
But, by God, the 506 is going to forge that brand-new concept...

395
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,090
...into victory.

396
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,250
Yes, sir.

397
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,090
I want you to know that I'm damned proud of each and every one of you.

398
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,430
Now, you deserve this party.

399
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,120
Thank you, Sergeant Grant.

400
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,260
Sir.

401
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,060
So, I want you to have fun and remember our motto:

402
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,230
Currahee!

403
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,070
Currahee!

404
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,930
Petty.

405
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,200
Map.

406
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,170
Come on.

407
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,900
Ah, Christ.

408
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,850
We're in the wrong position.

409
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,590
We're in the wrong position.

410
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,820
We're textbook position for ambush, sir.

411
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,360
We should sit tight, let the enemy team come into our killing zone.

412
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,860
They're right out there somewhere.

413
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,360
Let's just get them.

414
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,260
Sir, we have perfect cover here.

415
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,370
Lieutenant, deploy your troops.

416
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,900
2nd Platoon, move out.

417
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,940
What?

418
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,140
Tactical column.

419
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,860
Captain, you've just been killed, along with 95 percent of your company.

420
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,600
Your outfit?

421
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,300
Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th.

422
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,380
Leave three wounded men on the ground and report back to the assembly area.

423
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,910
Goddamn it.

424
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,820
You, you, you.

425
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,190
Well, what are you going to do?

426
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,200
Nothing, just keep training the men.

427
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,400
Am I interrupting?

428
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,730
No, no.

429
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,930
Lieutenant Lewis Nixon.

430
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,570
Lieutenant Harry Welsh, just in from the 82nd.

431
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,940
Congratulations on the promotion.

432
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,910
Thanks, if you want to call it that.

433
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,380
You'll learn him pretty quickly.

434
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,780
No flaws, no vices, no sense of humor.

435
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,320
Just like your chums up at battalion staff.

436
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,220
What's up?

437
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,750
I'm hearing a lot of rumblings.

438
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,950
Sobel?

439
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,590
Just talking about that.

440
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,930
So, he gets a little jumpy in the field?

441
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,390
He gets jumpy and then you get killed.

442
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,030
That's nice.

443
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,500
Yeah, listen, if we discuss it, I think it should just be amongst ourselves.

444
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,800
Absolutely.

445
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,670
2nd Platoon, ready?

446
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,840
Ready, sir.

447
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,110
Then get them in formation.

448
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,280
We're moving out.

449
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,720
Yes, sir.

450
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,410
Shut up, Cobb.

451
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,750
You got to admit it.

452
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,250
He's got no chance.

453
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,080
Either the Krauts will get him or one of us.

454
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,890
Who, Sobel?

455
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,090
He screwed up one maneuver.

456
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,920
Well, you know, I'm always fumbling with grenades.

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,160
It would be easy if one went off by accident, you know?

458
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,330
Well, now they must have put him in charge for a reason.

459
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,340
Yeah, 'cause the Army wouldn't make a mistake, right?

460
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,253
Going my way?

461
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,920
Wherever the train takes me.

462
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,076
Where do you suppose that might be?

463
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:22,150
I haven't got a clue

464
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,820
Yeah, come on, take a guess.

465
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,550
Atlantic, Pacific, Atlantic?

466
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm not the intelligence officer.

467
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,240
Well, as such, I, of course, know, but if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

468
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,740
So, don't tell me.

469
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,440
New York City.

470
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,810
Troopship.

471
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,240
England.

472
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,810
We're invading Europe, my friend.

473
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,480
Fortress Europa.

474
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,110
Since when do I drink?

475
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,130
If I thought you'd drink it, I wouldn't offer it to you.

476
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,930
Nix?

477
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,060
What are you going to do when you get into combat?

478
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,370
I have every confidence in my scrounging abilities.

479
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,280
And I have a case of VAT 69 hidden in your footlocker.

480
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,210
Really?

481
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,050
Oh, yeah.

482
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,580
'Morning.

483
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,160
This could turn into a real nice trip.

484
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,500
"Dear sir or madam:

485
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,970
"Soon your son will drop from the sky to engage and defeat the enemy.

486
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,250
"Your frequent letters of love and encouragement...

487
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,790
"...will arm him with a fighting heart.

488
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,350
"With that he cannot fail, but will win glory for himself...

489
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,020
"...make you proud of him, and his country ever grateful...

490
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,530
"...for his service in its hour of need.

491
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,270
"Signed, Herbert M. Sobel, Captain Commanding."

492
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,310
Right now, some lucky bastard's headed for the South Pacific.

493
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,360
Oh, what I'd give.

494
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,010
He's going to get billeted on some tropical island.

495
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:35,960
Keep talking.

496
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,050
Sitting under a palm tree with six naked native girls...

497
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,790
...helping him cut up coconuts so he can hand-feed them to the flamingos.

498
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,090
Flamingos are mean.

499
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,430
They bite.

500
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,130
So do the naked native girls.

501
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,360
With any luck.

502
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,700
Hey, guys, I'm glad I'm going to Europe.

503
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,740
Hitler gets one of these right across the windpipe.

504
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,970
Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving to Joe Toye Day...

505
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,540
...and pays me $10,000 a year for the rest of my fucking life.

506
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,280
What if we don't get to Europe?

507
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,180
What if they send us to North Africa?

508
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,380
My brother's in North Africa.

509
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,580
He says it's hot.

510
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,490
Really, it's hot in Africa?

511
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,080
Shut up.

512
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,130
The point is, it don't matter where we go.

513
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,260
In combat, the only person you can trust...

514
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,490
...is yourself and the fellow next to you.

515
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,540
Hey, as long as he's a paratrooper.

516
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,470
Oh, yeah?

517
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,510
And what if that paratrooper turns out to be Sobel?

518
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,270
If I'm next to Sobel in combat, I'm moving on down the line.

519
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,410
Hook up with some other officer, like Heyliger or Winters.

520
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,250
I like Winters, he's a good man.

521
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,290
But when the bullets start flying...

522
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,050
...I don't know if I want a Quaker doing my fighting for me.

523
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,110
How do you know he's a Quaker?

524
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,350
He ain't Catholic.

525
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,620
Neither is Sobel.

526
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,530
That prick's a son of Abraham.

527
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,930
He's what?

528
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,500
He's a Jew.

529
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,300
I'm a Jew.

530
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,660
Congratulations.

531
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,870
Get your nose out of my face.

532
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,040
What's all that about?

533
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,290
Gonorrhea called Sobel a Jew.

534
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,080
Liebgott took offense 'cause he's a Jew too.

535
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,360
Fighting over Sobel, that's smart.

536
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,010
Attack!

537
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,780
No, you want to kill him!

538
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,790
Parry right, parry left.

539
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,890
Thrust!

540
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,250
Take cover.

541
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,620
Okay.

542
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,960
Yesterday, we talked about magnetic declination...

543
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,460
...and the "left add, right subtract" rule.

544
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,090
Today we're putting it into practice.

545
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,330
There are two basic types of fighting positions.

546
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,270
The first is the prepared position.

547
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,080
The advantages of a prepared position are that it gives you cover and concealment.

548
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,810
Commence fire!

549
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,350
We'll then maneuver right in through these trees.

550
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,190
At the same time, our second platoon, in this particular case, moves over here.

551
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,630
He's then going to close with and kill or capture that German.

552
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,350
Sobel's late.

553
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,960
Why is there a fence here?

554
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,300
There should be no fence here.

555
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,514
- Tibbo - Yes, sir

556
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,010
Give me the map.

557
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,570
Perconte, Luz.

558
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,580
Get the men, get them...

559
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,340
Take cover behind those trees.

560
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,850
You heard the word. Let's go over there.

561
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,920
There should be no... There should be no fence here.

562
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,960
We could go over it, sir.

563
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,590
Really?

564
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,030
That's not the point. Where the goddamn...

565
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,170
Where the goddamn hell are we?

566
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,230
- Perconte? - Yeah.

567
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,670
- Sobel's lost again, right? - Yeah, he's lost.

568
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,870
Fucking Christ.

569
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,900
Can you do Major Horton?

570
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,680
Does a wild bear crap in the woods, son?

571
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,780
Maybe the good major can goose this schmuck.

572
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,120
Get us moving?

573
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,550
No way.

574
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,850
Yes. You got to.

575
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,920
All right, just this once.

576
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,530
Three-five-six-eight-three-three.

577
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,760
Isn't that the intersection?

578
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,030
No, sir, it's here.

579
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,470
You're a full grid off.

580
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,710
Goddamn it.

581
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,400
Is there a problem, Captain Sobel?

582
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,570
Who said that?

583
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,980
Who broke silence?

584
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,850
I think it's Major Horton, sir.

585
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,180
Major Horton?

586
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,920
What is he... Did he join us?

587
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,220
I think maybe he's moving between the platoons, sir.

588
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,130
What is the goddamn holdup, Mr. Sobel?

589
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,230
A fence, sir.

590
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
God!

591
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,870
A barbed wire fence.

592
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh, that dog just ain't going to hunt!

593
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,570
Now, you cut that fence and get this goddamn platoon on the move!

594
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,880
Yes, sir!

595
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,510
Where are my goddamn wire cutters?

596
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,890
We have to move.

597
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,430
Sir, without Captain Sobel and 1st Platoon?

598
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,960
It's a T-intersection. We improvise.

599
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,130
Double envelopment laid on a base of fire to cut the road in all directions.

600
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,760
Hook right with first squad. Tell Guarnere to move left with second.

601
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,827
I'll be right up the middle with third, go.

602
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:28,900
Yes, sir.

603
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,800
Deary me.

604
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,410
Bloody hell.

605
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,960
You've done it now, Yanks.

606
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,230
You've captured me.

607
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,040
Hi-ho, Silver!

608
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,150
Would that be the enemy?

609
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,670
As a matter of fact, yes.

610
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,090
Good work, 2nd Platoon.

611
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,560
We took the objective.

612
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,900
Who is the idiot who cut that man's fence?

613
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,130
I was ordered to, sir.

614
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,040
By whom?

615
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,300
Major Horton, sir.

616
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,371
Major Horton?

617
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:11,910
Yes, sir.

618
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,749
Major Horton told you to do that?

619
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:14,570
Yes, sir.

620
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,380
Major Horton ordered you to cut the fence?

621
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,550
Yes, he did.

622
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,350
Major Horton is on leave in London.

623
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,750
Get those cows out of here.

624
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,190
Lieutenant Winters.

625
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,750
With Captain Sobel's compliments, sir.

626
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,090
Lieutenant.

627
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,080
Oh, for crying out loud.

628
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,360
This spells court-martial.

629
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,520
Wide open! Yes.

630
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,230
No, sir, I do not understand.

631
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,090
Your orders to me were to inspect the latrines at 1000 hours.

632
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,670
From 0930 to 0955 I was censoring the enlisted men's mail by order of Colonel Strayer.

633
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,640
At 1000 hours I followed your orders to the minute.

634
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,370
I changed that time to 0945.

635
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,510
No one told me, sir.

636
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,640
I telephoned.

637
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,150
I'm quartered with a family that has no telephone.

638
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,620
And sent a runner.

639
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,120
No runner found me, Captain.

640
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,300
Irregardless, when given a task to perform by a ranking officer

641
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:11,600
you should have delegated your task of latrine inspection to another officer.

642
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,100
You failed to do so.

643
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,090
Were I to let such a failure of duty by my own X O go unpunished...

644
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,470
...what kind of message is that to the men?

645
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,830
I performed my duty as I was ordered, sir.

646
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,510
And I disagree.

647
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,970
So, your options are quite simple, Lieutenant.

648
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,580
Punishment for your offenses will be denial of a 48-hour pass for 60 days.

649
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,780
Stand before me at attention.

650
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,260
Or you may initiate a letter of appeal and request a trial by court-martial.

651
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,030
You spend your weekends on the base anyway, Dick.

652
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,030
Be a man, take the punishment.

653
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,330
May I borrow your pen, sir?

654
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,840
My endorsement, sir.

655
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,650
I request trial by court-martial.

656
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,100
We lost Winters to battalion mess.

657
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,379
You're shitting me.

658
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:27,400
No.

659
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,430
Strayer did it, while they try to figure out the procedures for his court-martial.

660
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,640
Nix better find a loophole and get him out.

661
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:34,800
And if he don't?

662
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,710
Winters scrambles eggs while the rest of us make the big jump with Sobel.

663
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,750
Not me.

664
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,890
So we're going through with this, right?

665
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,850
We've got to do something.

666
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,150
Yeah.

667
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,850
All right.

668
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,920
Good.

669
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,620
But we'd all better be clear on the consequences.

670
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,400
- I don't care about the consequences. - You got.

671
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,030
We could be lined up against a wall and shot.

672
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,910
Now, I'm ready to face that.

673
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,880
And every one of us had better be, too.

674
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,010
I will not follow that man into combat.

675
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,320
Me neither.

676
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,590
All right.

677
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,360
Then let's do it.

678
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,910
"I hereby...

679
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,240
"...no longer wish to serve...

680
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,980
"...as a non-commissioned officer...

681
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,760
"...in Easy Company."

682
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,050
All right, boys.

683
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,210
Good luck.

684
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,250
I ought to have you all shot!

685
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,320
This is nothing less than an act of mutiny...

686
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,460
...while we prepare for the goddamn invasion of Europe.

687
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,120
Sergeant Harris.

688
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,930
Sir.

689
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,990
Turn in your stripes, collect your gear.

690
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,830
You are hereby transferred out of my regiment.

691
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,770
Sir.

692
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,670
Get out.

693
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,610
Sergeant Ranney.

694
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,970
Sir.

695
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,210
You consider yourself lucky, I'm only busting you to private.

696
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,320
All of you NCOs have disgraced the 101st Airborne.

697
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,320
Consider yourself lucky that we are on the eve of the largest action in the history of warfare...

698
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,290
...which leaves me no choice but to spare your lives.

699
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,430
Now, get out of my office and get out of my sight.

700
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,160
Get.

701
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,550
Keep them coming, atta-boy.

702
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,980
I can only speculate, sir. Most of the men would never do this...

703
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,150
...but I believe just a few of the sergeants may have felt...

704
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,030
...their loyalty lay more to the platoon than to the company.

705
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,530
And these few sergeants convinced all of the other NCOs in your company...

706
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,870
...to turn in their stripes?

707
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,900
As staff sergeants, they have a great amount of influence, sir.

708
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,700
But as I say, the rest are good men.

709
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,200
I know them, I can work with them.

710
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,680
This business with the Winters' court-martial...

711
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,950
...has been an unpleasant distraction.

712
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,010
Indeed it has, sir.

713
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,180
However...

714
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,630
...your command of Easy Company has been exemplary.

715
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,490
Thank you, sir.

716
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,540
In fact, except for the actions of a few of your non-coms...

717
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,770
...I believe you've fielded one of the finest companies of soldiers I've ever seen.

718
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes, sir.

719
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,840
Herbert, Division has established...

720
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,350
...a parachute training school at Chilton Foliat.

721
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,870
The idea is for non-infantry types who...

722
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,520
...were vital to the coming invasion...

723
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,290
...such as doctors and chaplains, to take jump training there.

724
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,060
I can't think of anyone more qualified...

725
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,690
...to command such a school than you are.

726
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,540
Sir?

727
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,170
I'm reassigning you to Chilton Foliat.

728
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,350
I'm losing Easy Company?

729
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,480
The war effort needs you elsewhere.

730
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,020
Permission to speak, sir?

731
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,330
Granted.

732
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,330
Is... Who will be replacing me?

733
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,700
Lieutenant Meehan from Baker Company is senior.

734
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,250
Good luck at Chilton Foliat, Herbert.

735
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,910
Don't let us down now.

736
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,880
No, sir.

737
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,030
Carry on.

738
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,720
2nd Platoon, listen up.

739
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,620
I want the first squad and A-side tents right up there.

740
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,590
Third squad, second row...

741
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,840
Holy shit.

742
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,110
No, it's all right. We're tommies...

743
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,540
...not bleeding boche.

744
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,810
Is all this real?

745
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,900
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,680
Some is from the Hermans, somebody's tailor's knocked up.

747
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,720
For you, so you can get your mince pies on this Jerry clobber...

748
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,120
...if you know what I mean.

749
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,350
Not really.

750
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,250
Mack, you got a Luger?

751
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,990
I'm dying to get a real Luger.

752
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,260
Yeah, go on then.

753
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,990
A quick butchers, yeah?

754
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,900
Boy, she sure is a doozy.

755
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,270
Yeah, it's pukka, ain't it?

756
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,270
What?

757
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,300
Hey, Petty.

758
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,080
Hey, mate.

759
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,680
You're having a bath if you think you're half-inching that.

760
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,480
Oh, yeah.

761
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,280
Sorry. Well, good luck.

762
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,550
You too, mate.

763
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,690
What's up, Hoobs?

764
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,590
These men have been through the toughest training the Army has to offer.

765
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,820
Under the worst possible circumstances.

766
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,460
And they volunteered for it.

767
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,630
Christ, I was just shooting craps with them. It's not like...

768
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,500
You know why they volunteered?

769
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,480
So, when things got really bad, the man next to them would be the best.

770
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,670
Not some draftee who's going to get him killed.

771
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,720
Are you ticked because they like me?

772
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,740
Because I'm spending time to get to know my soldiers?

773
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,780
You've been with these guys for what, two years?

774
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,380
I've been here for six days.

775
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:14,920
You're gambling, Bob.

776
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,820
So what? Soldiers do that.

777
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,800
I don't deserve a reprimand for it.

778
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,860
What if you'd won?

779
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:22,861
What?

780
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:25,510
What if you'd won?

781
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,700
Never put yourself in a position where you can take from these men.

782
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,980
Lieutenant Meehan?

783
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,080
Enter.

784
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,960
On the last training jump, I had a compass.

785
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,950
Close the flap.

786
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,130
Then we turn left.

787
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,190
Yeah.

788
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,030
Bearing zero-four-two.

789
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,300
12 minutes.

790
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,900
Then another left?

791
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:02,150
- Yes - Yeah

792
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,570
Call it three-five-eight...

793
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,470
...for 10 and a half minutes.

794
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,840
Green light, right over Ramsbury.

795
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,970
Ramsbury.

796
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,680
Every single time.

797
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,040
Linear distance on the grid of about...

798
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:21,690
Okay.

799
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,780
Ramsbury.

800
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,520
Upottery.

801
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,260
So...

802
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,770
It's Normandy.

803
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,170
St. Marie du Mont.

804
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,800
Causeway Number One.

805
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,570
Causeway Number Two.

806
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,310
The ultimate field problem.

807
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,710
The estuary of the Douve River divides two beachheads...

808
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,380
...code-named Utah, here, and Omaha, here.

809
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,750
Seaborne Infantry will hit these beaches in force...

810
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,020
...at a date and time to be specified.

811
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,590
H-hour, D-day.

812
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,030
Airborne's objective, gentlemen, is to take the town of Carentan...

813
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,970
...thus linking Utah and Omaha into a single, continuous beachhead.

814
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,480
...linking Omaha and Utah into one continuous beachhead.

815
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,010
Each trooper will learn this operation by heart...

816
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,550
...and know his and every other outfits' mission to the detail.

817
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,380
Meehan?

818
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,650
Yes, Dukeman.

819
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,020
Sir, are we dropping tonight?

820
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,080
When it's time for you to know, we'll let you know.

821
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,720
In the meantime, study these sand tables, maps, and reconnaissance photos...

822
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,520
...until you can draw a map of the area by memory.

823
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,570
Now, we will drop behind this Atlantic wall five hours

824
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,320
before the 4th Infantry lands at Utah.

825
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,840
And between our assembly area and the battalion's objective...

826
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,210
...there is a German garrison right here in this area, St. Marie du Mont.

827
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,780
Easy Company will destroy that garrison.

828
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,880
Three-day supply of K rations, chocolate bars, charms, candy...

829
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,950
...powdered coffee, sugar, and matches.

830
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,980
Compass, bayonet, entrenching tool, ammunition, gas mask.

831
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,460
Musette bag with ammo, my webbing, my.45, canteen...

832
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,960
...two cartons of smokes.

833
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,020
Hawkins mine, two grenades, smoke grenade, gamma grenade...

834
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,700
...TNT, this bullshit, and a pair of nasty skivvies.

835
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:16,860
What's your point?

836
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,310
This weighs as much as I do.

837
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,440
I've still got my chute, my reserve chute, my Mae West, my M-1.

838
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,710
Where are you keeping your brass knuckles?

839
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,150
I could use some brass knuckles.

840
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,320
Hey, anything for me?

841
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,480
No.

842
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,530
Sergeant Martin.

843
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,160
For Talbert.

844
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,490
Heavy! condoms?

845
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,930
I don't know, probably.

846
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,830
What you got?

847
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,500
"Dear Floyd: Give them hell."

848
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,770
It's from the chief of the Kokomo Police.

849
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,900
Right.

850
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,580
You've got to love cops.

851
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,840
All right, listen up, listen up.

852
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,580
If you did not sign your GI life insurance policy...

853
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,330
...you go on over and see Sergeant Evans at the headquarters company tent.

854
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,960
You boys don't let your families miss out on $10,000.

855
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,130
You hear that, Gerry?

856
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,000
Hey, Lip?

857
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,040
Yeah, boy.

858
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,130
Has Guarnere said anything about his brother?

859
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,170
No.

860
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,400
I got a problem.

861
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,410
My wife keeps up with things back home, casualty lists and like that.

862
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,500
Yeah?

863
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,410
Guarnere's brother in Italy?

864
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,680
Henry?

865
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,420
Killed in Monte Cassino.

866
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,980
Well, I'm sure he doesn't know.

867
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,890
Damn.

868
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,620
What'd you think I should do?

869
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,160
If it were me, I'd tell him.

870
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,820
Couple of hours before we jump?

871
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,730
I don't know.

872
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,470
Why are they springing these things on us now?

873
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,240
It's just an extra 80 pounds strapped to your leg.

874
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,880
Does anybody have any idea how the hell this thing works?

875
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,750
Colonel Sink.

876
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,960
Colonel Sink.

877
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,400
"Soldiers of the regiment.

878
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:27,830
"Tonight is the night of nights.

879
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,900
"Today, as you read this...

880
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,840
"...you are en route to the great adventure for which you have trained...

881
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,970
"...for over two years."

882
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,270
So, that's why they gave us ice cream.

883
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,520
Easy Company, listen up!

884
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,720
Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

885
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,390
No jump tonight.

886
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,150
The invasion has been postponed.

887
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,660
We're on a 24-hour stand-down.

888
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,630
Well, this is quite a surprise.

889
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,900
Not particularly.

890
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,000
It so happens I rather expected it.

891
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:13,310
Well, I can't see how you people can pass up $80,000 for the Cause.

892
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,940
For whose cause?

893
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,440
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

894
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,850
...why don't you join the Army?

895
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,410
Next, please.

896
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,560
Oh, 4F.

897
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,030
You look 1A to me.

898
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,030
You don't look so bad yourself.

899
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,060
"Dearest Johnny"?

900
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,930
Well, should you be giving blood?

901
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,200
I woke up.

902
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,170
I got the wrong goddamn jacket.

903
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,870
I was struck by lightning.

904
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,780
Nobody dancing.

905
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,010
It doesn't matter.

906
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,380
"Your pal, Bill Guarnere's brother..."

907
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,680
Good luck, lads.

908
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,080
See you, tommies.

909
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,420
See you, mate.

910
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,360
Try and get these leg straps through.

911
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,600
Johnny?

912
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,880
Got something you might be looking for.

913
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,250
Took your jacket by mistake.

914
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,520
I'm sorry.

915
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,990
You read it?

916
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,920
Where the fuck is Monte Cassino?

917
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,960
I don't know. Italy somewhere.

918
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,130
Sorry about your brother, Bill.

919
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,430
I'm sorry for my ma.

920
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,070
He was...

921
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,040
Let's get this over with.

922
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,550
Bill?

923
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,220
I'll meet up with you over there.

924
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,500
Gentlemen, Doc Roe is handing these out for air sickness.

925
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,430
Orders are, "Every man takes one now, another, 30 minutes in the air."

926
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,330
Lieutenant.

927
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,640
2nd Platoon, listen up.

928
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,610
Good luck.

929
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,810
God bless you.

930
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,490
I'll see you in the assembly area.

931
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:16,710
If the wire contacts are sensitive, then I think all we should have to do...

932
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,580
Goddamn, Lieb.

933
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,650
That airsick pill is making me loopy.
