1
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,490
I never thought I'd get through D-day.

2
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,300
Let alone the next phase or the next phase.

3
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,660
I thought I was going to get killed instantly.

4
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,670
I thought one of two things:

5
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,580
A quick death or...

6
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,140
...I'd come through probably without a scratch.

7
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,010
I think everybody had fear.

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,320
I think there's people that can handle fear.

9
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,250
I think...

10
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,610
I think I was probably one of them.

11
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,350
I think I was just as...

12
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,390
...scared as anybody else except I could think.

13
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,530
It's a feeling you would not let yourself down...

14
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,700
...and you would not let your comrades or your unit down.

15
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,370
We all had fear.

16
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,830
But we all had training to know that...

17
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,410
...you try to handle your fear...

18
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,150
...and work to accomplish what you're supposed to be doing.

19
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,930
Hey, it looks like what's-his-name.

20
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,240
You know, from 1st Platoon?

21
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,370
Our 1st platoon?

22
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,140
It sure does.

23
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,150
Blithe.

24
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
Hey, Blithe.

25
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Blithe!

26
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,310
Thought that was you.

27
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,610
You alone?

28
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,610
You're the first familiar faces I've seen.

29
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,120
I ain't surprised.

30
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,750
They dropped us all over the peninsula.

31
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,730
We've been fighting with the 502nd since we hit the ground.

32
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,590
You?

33
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,230
Oh, I've been...

34
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,300
...trying to find Easy.

35
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,600
Join the club.

36
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,620
Hey, fellows.

37
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,730
Well, look who decided to show up, Floyd.

38
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,860
Hi there, Luz.

39
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,760
We thought we'd never find you guys.

40
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,770
Hey, Tab, get a load of this.

41
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,600
You like that?

42
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,610
It's the real stuff.

43
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,770
Yeah, of course.

44
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,780
You like this?

45
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,640
Oh, nice.

46
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,640
That's a beauty, Sarge.

47
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,510
My Luger's gonna put you all to shame when I get it.

48
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,950
How was your jump?

49
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,630
Missed the DZ.

50
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,660
Yeah, that goes without saying.

51
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,160
I guess so.

52
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,830
Got any souvenirs to trade?

53
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,040
What?

54
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,870
They're all ticking.

55
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,980
Unlike their previous owners.

56
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,210
Got anything good?

57
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,880
Not yet.

58
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,650
Hey.

59
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,230
So, have we lost anybody?

60
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,630
Tommy Burgess took one in the face.

61
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,290
Popeye Wynn got pinked in the behind.

62
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,760
But they're gonna be okay.

63
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,430
That's good.

64
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,440
You run into Lt. Meehan on your travels?

65
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,870
No, why?

66
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,800
Company HQ's still missing.

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,500
They think the plane crashed.

68
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,010
They say he's gonna turn up.

69
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,870
Yeah, I ain't holding my breath.

70
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,410
Who's in command, then?

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,570
Winters for now.

72
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,550
Lieutenant Welsh is 1st Platoon.

73
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,450
Let's go, 1st Platoon!

74
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,090
Easy's moving out!

75
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,820
On your feet.

76
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,890
Stand up, lift up. Let's go.

77
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,030
Listen up!

78
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,230
It'll be dark soon.

79
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,930
I want light and noise discipline from here on.

80
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,440
No talking, no smoking.

81
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,100
No playing grab-fanny with the man in front of you, Luz.

82
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,080
So, where we headed to, Lieutenant?

83
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,310
We're taking Carentan.

84
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,510
That sounds like fun.

85
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,380
It's the only place where armor from Omaha and Utah Beach...

86
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,040
...can link up and head inland.

87
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,250
Until we take it, they're stuck on the sand.

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,550
General Taylor's sending the whole division.

89
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,560
Remember, boys...

90
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,690
...give me three days and three nights of hard fighting...

91
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,790
...and you will be relieved.

92
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,490
Lieutenant.

93
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,160
Lieutenant, I'll take point.

94
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,230
Corporal Hoobler will be lead scout.

95
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,930
Blithe, glad you could join us.

96
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,010
Thank you, sir.

97
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,470
1st Platoon, fall in behind Fox Company.

98
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,340
You people from 2nd and 3rd Platoon, follow us.

99
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,900
Let's shake a leg.

100
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,040
Another thing to remember, boys...

101
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,820
...flies spread disease.

102
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,650
So, keep yours closed.

103
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,030
Don't wake Jerry.

104
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,550
- Damn! - What?

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,420
We lost F Company, sir.

106
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,690
Again?

107
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,590
We lost F Company.

108
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,890
Again?

109
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,860
Hey, Blithe, Skinny, guess what?

110
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,030
- Perconte, go tell them to hold up. - Yes, sir.

111
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,700
- Hoobler, take Blithe, go find F Company. - Yes, sir.

112
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,970
Come on, Blithe.

113
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,680
Shit.

114
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,850
Did you send somebody?

115
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,390
Hoobler and Blithe are there now.

116
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,650
Why are we stopped?

117
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,330
This is about officers crapping out on their training, Nix.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,230
Come on, let's get this show on the road.

119
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,130
Dang mosquitoes.

120
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,580
What is it?

121
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Shh

122
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,460
Flash.

123
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,520
Thunder.

124
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,800
I can hear y'll all the way across the field.

125
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,990
You F Company?

126
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,830
That's right.

127
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,170
Where you all been?

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,470
Blithe, go back to the Lieutenant.

129
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,440
Tell him we've found F Company.

130
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,210
I'll figure out where these yokels are.

131
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,650
Hey, who you all calling a yokel?

132
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,830
He's dead, Private.

133
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,760
Did you find Fox Company?

134
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,390
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,270
I thought he...

136
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,600
I thought he had me.

137
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,010
Fallschirmjager.

138
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:35,940
Paratrooper?

139
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,140
We think there's a regiment of them holding Carentan.

140
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,810
Well, there's one less to worry about.

141
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,820
Yeah.

142
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,850
That's edelweiss.

143
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,580
That only grows in the Alps above the tree line...

144
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,920
...which means he climbed up there to get it.

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,360
It's supposed to be the mark of a true soldier.

146
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,210
Take the 1st straight up the middle...

147
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,150
...hard and fast.

148
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,190
We must move quickly.

149
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,450
I'll be right behind you with 2nd and 3rd.

150
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,930
Go!

151
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,630
Let's go, 1st, let's go.

152
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,680
Go, go, go!

153
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,880
In the ditch!

154
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,960
Incoming!

155
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,990
God damn it!

156
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,060
Where the fuck is everybody?

157
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,530
Where did everybody go?

158
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,330
I have no idea!

159
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,570
Let's go, Easy!

160
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,210
Get those MGs moving, will you?

161
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,070
Let's get them out of there.

162
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,080
They're in the open, for Pete's sake!

163
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,880
Go, go!

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,680
Get going, Buck.

165
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,650
Follow me, Easy!

166
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,990
Move out!

167
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,750
Move out, men!

168
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,090
Go!

169
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,720
Move out, move out!

170
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,430
Get yourselves out of that ditch!

171
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,530
We have men getting killed out there, Blithe!

172
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,540
Move!

173
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,810
Upstairs window, left.

174
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,810
Get yourselves out of those trenches!

175
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,950
Incoming!

176
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,680
That's an MG-42.

177
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,640
There's one in the right upper...

178
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,650
Medic!

179
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,740
Upper flank!

180
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, shit!

181
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,000
Snipers, that way...

182
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,030
...take his lower left.

183
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,510
Ah, shit!

184
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,850
We need some covering fire. Ready, Luz?

185
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,650
Okay, I'm out.

186
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,860
Shit!

187
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,760
Guarnere, clear that sector on the right!

188
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,170
Hit them with me!

189
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,550
You okay, Shifty?

190
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,810
We gotta take that warehouse!

191
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,750
Shifty!

192
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,660
Hammer those windows.

193
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,660
Tipper, take Liebgott, start clearing these buildings.

194
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,460
Right. Let's go!

195
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,870
Second two, go, go!

196
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
Houses on the right!

197
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,430
Smash.

198
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,660
Grenade.

199
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,070
Luz, come on, Luz.

200
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,410
Come on.

201
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,240
Close behind.

202
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,290
Shit!

203
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,040
They got us zeroed!

204
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,210
Spread it out, spread it out!

205
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,540
Go!

206
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,840
Get the hell out of there!

207
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,940
They got us zeroed!

208
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,480
Get out of there!

209
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,450
Go, go!

210
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,450
Get the hell out of the street!

211
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,750
Move, now.

212
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Go, go, go!

213
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,800
Come on, let's get you out of here.

214
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,810
Come on, boy.

215
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,680
Move, move, move!

216
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,340
Get off the street!

217
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,910
Go, go!

218
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,810
Move it, now!

219
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,890
Hey, buddy.

220
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,060
You're okay, Lip.

221
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,660
Everything's right where it should be.

222
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,370
Come on, upsy-daisy.

223
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,600
Get Tipper up here with the bazooka.

224
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,410
Hello?

225
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,640
Anybody there?

226
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,590
Tipper!

227
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,990
Tip!

228
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,730
Tipper!

229
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,460
Answer me, Tip!

230
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,330
Joe?

231
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,300
Looking good, Tip.

232
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,130
Is that you?

233
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,540
Looking real good.

234
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,500
Come here, you gotta sit down.

235
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,770
Come here, come on.

236
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,870
Easy, easy.

237
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,140
There you go, there you go.

238
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,180
Ah, Jesus.

239
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,160
You hang in there, buddy.

240
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,570
Okay, we're gonna get you fixed up.

241
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,530
All right? Okay.

242
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,530
Guys, you wanna give me a hand here?

243
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,800
Come on.

244
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,770
Take the left flank!

245
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,430
Take the left flank!

246
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,810
"In the name of the Father and..."

247
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,980
Hey, Malark.

248
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,180
You see what I'm seeing?

249
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,380
"...is now, and ever shall be, world without end.

250
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,550
"Amen."

251
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,890
Crazy fools, the Irish.

252
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,590
You should know.

253
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,500
Smokey, the window! Let's go!

254
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,590
Morning, sir.

255
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,960
What's your name, trooper?

256
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,500
Sergeant Farmsworth from Able Company 501st.

257
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,170
I'm supposed to tell you...

258
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,710
...it's clear from here north...

259
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,830
...of them Krauts, sir.

260
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,840
Well, tell your CO 506 arrived in force...

261
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,840
...and secured all positions south of you.

262
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,070
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.

263
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,840
Come on, bad boy, let's go!

264
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,480
Lieutenant Winters.

265
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,710
Yes, sir?

266
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,650
Is it safe to cross now?

267
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,450
What's that, sir?

268
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,950
Is it safe to cross?

269
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,590
We wanna move the wounded.

270
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,560
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,320
Okay.

272
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,970
Come on, let's get them out of here.

273
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,140
There she is.

274
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,720
You're lucky it was a ricochet.

275
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,850
You just caught a piece of it.

276
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,690
Stupid.

277
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,750
What?

278
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,490
Nothing.

279
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,260
Walking wounded to the rear.

280
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,120
Now, you gonna be able to stay off it?

281
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,500
Doesn't look that way.

282
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,560
Well, you gotta try, huh?

283
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,330
What have we got planned, chief?

284
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,730
Well, we expect a counterattack.

285
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,840
Carentan's as important to them as it is to us.

286
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,170
Any idea when?

287
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,910
We're not waiting around to find out.

288
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,280
Battalion wants us to head east to high ground...

289
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,050
...set up a defensive position.

290
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,380
With the flooded fields...

291
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,420
...it's the only direction they'd come from.

292
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,680
Yeah.

293
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,780
You gonna be all right?

294
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,120
Yeah.

295
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,960
Good.

296
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,130
What's wrong with Blithe?

297
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,440
Well, nothing, except he can't see.

298
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,440
He can't see?

299
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,670
So he says.

300
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,890
Blithe?

301
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,830
It's Lieutenant Winters.

302
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,530
What happened?

303
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,180
I don't know, sir.

304
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,080
Things they just kind of went black on me.

305
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,120
You can't see?

306
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,710
Not a thing, sir.

307
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,890
I can't see a thing.

308
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,520
Well, you just take it easy, Blithe.

309
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,400
We're gonna get you out of here.

310
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,260
Get you back to England.

311
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,200
It's gonna be okay.

312
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,930
Sir...

313
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,610
...I didn't wanna let anyone down.

314
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,410
Just take it easy.

315
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,350
It's okay, son.

316
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,560
Sir.

317
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,200
Yeah, what is it?

318
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,570
Thank you, sir.

319
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,670
I'm okay.

320
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,050
Yeah, I'm okay.

321
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,220
I'm okay.

322
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,380
I think I'm okay.

323
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,920
You can see?

324
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,830
God, I don't know what happened.

325
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,230
I think, I think I'm okay.

326
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,200
All right.

327
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,530
Well, stay here a little while longer...

328
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
...and make sure.

329
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,230
And, then you can report back to your platoon.

330
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,040
Yes, sir.

331
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,450
Now, can we get that bandage on?

332
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,290
Yeah.

333
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,330
Berlin by Christmas.

334
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,930
That's how I see it.

335
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,490
Yeah, you're full of it.

336
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,230
Oh, God.

337
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,770
This Kraut cheese tastes like...

338
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
It stinks.

339
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,100
Bread's stale, too.

340
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,240
Give me that.

341
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,310
Yes, sir, the way we came in town today and took over...

342
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,650
...it don't seem Jerry's got much fight left.

343
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,280
More, don't get hit in the face...

344
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,980
...when Jerry throws in the sponge.

345
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,550
You mark my words, Mal, Berlin by Christmas.

346
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,120
Enjoy it while it lasts.

347
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,820
We'll be moving out, soon.

348
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,960
Out of town, Lieutenant? Already?

349
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,700
That's right.

350
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,110
Don't they know we're just getting settled here?

351
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,050
Nice, Groucho.

352
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,070
What?

353
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,210
Real smart.

354
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,510
You know, you're taking your life in your own hands.

355
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,850
Ain't that right?

356
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,090
I told you, I didn't actually see it.

357
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,720
What, his shooting the prisoners...

358
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,350
...or the sergeant in his platoon?

359
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,990
- Sergeant? - I didn't hear that one.

360
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,360
He shot one of his own guys?

361
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,560
Well, supposedly the guy was drunk...

362
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,630
...and refused to go on a patrol.

363
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,230
Who knows if it's true.

364
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,810
Well, I know a guy who said an eyewitness...

365
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,780
...told him that Speirs hosed those prisoners.

366
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,110
Why?

367
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,740
What for?

368
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,240
On D-day.

369
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,080
Speirs comes across this group of Kraut prisoners...

370
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,520
...digging a hole or some such under guard and all.

371
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,180
He breaks out a pack of smokes...

372
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,890
...passes them out.

373
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,960
He even gives them a light.

374
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,730
Then, all of a sudden...

375
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,560
...he swings up his Thompson...

376
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,100
...and he hoses them.

377
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,870
I mean, goddamn, gives them smokes first?

378
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,150
You see, that's why I don't believe he really did it.

379
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,120
You don't believe it?

380
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,480
I heard he didn't do it.

381
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Oh, no, no, it was him all right.

382
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,130
But it was more than eight guys.

383
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,770
It was more like 20.

384
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,300
Hell of a shot.

385
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,370
All except one guy...

386
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,430
...who he left alone.

387
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,240
Well, all I know, from what I heard...

388
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,220
...he took that last 105 on D-day practically by himself.

389
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,150
Running through MG fire like a maniac.

390
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,190
Yeah, that I did see.

391
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,380
- On his own? - Yeah

392
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,750
I don't care if any of the other stuff's true.

393
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,880
Hey, Albert.

394
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,250
What do you think?

395
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,050
I don't know.

396
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,070
I'm gonna have to take everybody's word for it.

397
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,330
I didn't see any of it.

398
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,930
Let's go, 1st Platoon, weapons on me.

399
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,360
We're moving out.

400
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,530
Hey, take all your smokes.

401
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,940
On your feet, tactical column.

402
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,740
Flankers, up.

403
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,540
That means you, Private Blithe.

404
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,410
Come on, Blithe, get up.

405
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,330
Hey, Luz? What?

406
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,670
How far we going?

407
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,610
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank, I don't know.

408
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,800
Until they tell us to stop.

409
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,010
High ground.

410
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,510
There's high ground up ahead.

411
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,520
Okay, genius, answer me this then:

412
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,290
Why is Easy Company the only company who's either...

413
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,020
...at the front of an advance or, like now...

414
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,250
...exposed at the far edge of the line?

415
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,890
To keep you on your toes.

416
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,490
No, that's not what I'm saying.

417
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,960
I'm saying that we're never in the middle.

418
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,170
And we're the fifth of nine companies of this regiment.

419
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,100
Able through Item.

420
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,800
Think of it.

421
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,400
See there, you see that?

422
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,710
Incoming!

423
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,400
Contact right!

424
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,380
Get in the hedgerow!

425
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,910
See what I mean?

426
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,460
Left, bring it around!

427
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,660
Stay low!

428
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,460
Luz, get down here with the radio now!

429
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,980
What have they got to sing about?

430
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,280
Flash!

431
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,520
Thunder.

432
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,950
Catchy tune...

433
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,190
...ain't it?

434
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,420
Hey, Lieutenant, what's the news?

435
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,060
Oh, same as it was this afternoon.

436
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,900
They're in their hedgerow, we're in ours.

437
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,700
Spell me a minute, sir?

438
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,770
Are you gonna let Blithe get some sack time?

439
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,170
My back teeth are floating.

440
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,300
Get back here ASAP, Martin.

441
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,570
Count on me, sir.

442
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,180
How you doing, Blithe?

443
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,660
I'm okay, sir.

444
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,130
What happened at the aid station today?

445
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,360
Doc Roe...

446
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,500
...called it hysterical blindness.

447
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,310
No, thank you, sir.

448
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,610
You know what they said on basic:

449
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,440
"Dehydration's a soldier's worst enemy."

450
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,350
Yeah.

451
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,280
It's a game, Blithe.

452
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,680
That's all.

453
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,200
Hell, we're just moving the ball forward...

454
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,750
...one yard at a time.

455
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,360
Nothing but a game.

456
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,290
What is, sir?

457
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,000
This. The whole thing.

458
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,070
No.

459
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,810
Thank you, sir.

460
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,010
Just a game.

461
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,610
Harry?

462
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,130
S-2 said the Germans only left a company to defend Carentan.

463
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah. The rest pulled out sometime last night.

464
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,170
I knew that town was too easy.

465
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,510
Yeah.

466
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,700
They regrouped south of town.

467
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,840
May have been on their way to a counterattack...

468
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,540
...when we ran into them here.

469
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,910
Strength unknown.

470
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,280
They want the town back.

471
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,250
And we're in their way.

472
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,860
If they don't come first...

473
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,160
...we're attacking at first light, 0530.

474
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,660
I'll tell the men to fix bayonets.

475
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,490
Not much of a limp.

476
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,230
I'll survive.

477
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,800
How is it?

478
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,570
Hurts.

479
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,470
War is hell.

480
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,930
Smith, wake up.

481
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,430
Come on, Smith.

482
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,970
Get up, it's your watch.

483
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,070
Smith.

484
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,370
It's your watch.

485
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,200
Easy, Smith, it's me, Talbert.

486
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,840
Smith, what the hell are you doing?

487
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,140
That's Talbert.

488
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,980
Goddamn.

489
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,080
Oh, gosh.

490
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,910
Medic!

491
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,650
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

492
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,510
He looked like a Kraut.

493
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,880
I didn't know it was him.

494
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,720
You gotta breathe.

495
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,420
Look at me, look at me.

496
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah, I can breathe!

497
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,420
I'll put sulfur on the wound.

498
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,480
You're gonna be fine.

499
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,840
What the hell is that?

500
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,770
Sounds like it's coming from 3rd Platoon.

501
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,240
You wanna get some sleep?

502
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,720
I don't think, I don't think I can.

503
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,150
Then go take a look.

504
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,350
Sarge.

505
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,190
Flash.

506
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,460
Thunder, thunder!

507
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,860
Lieutenant Speirs, sir.

508
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
Where are you going, Private?

509
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,970
Check out the noise, sir.

510
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,100
I just came from there.

511
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,730
Everything's under control.

512
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,140
Yes, sir.

513
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,150
Got some nervous privates in your company.

514
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,750
We do, sir.

515
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,320
Yeah, we do, I can vouch for that.

516
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,390
They just don't see how simple it is.

517
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,760
How simple what is, sir?

518
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,870
Just do what you have to do.

519
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,240
Like you did on D-day, sir?

520
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,950
Lieutenant.

521
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,240
Sir, when I landed on D-day...

522
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,420
...I found myself in a ditch all by myself.

523
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,800
I fell asleep.

524
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,970
I think it was those air-sickness pills they gave us.

525
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,530
When I woke up, I didn't really try to find my unit...

526
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,310
...to fight.

527
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,680
I just...

528
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,750
I just kind of stayed put.

529
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,060
What's your name, trooper?

530
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,260
Blithe, sir.

531
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,030
Albert Blithe.

532
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,900
You know why you hid in that ditch, Blithe?

533
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,640
I was scared.

534
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,870
We're all scared.

535
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,910
You hid in that ditch because you think there's still hope.

536
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,710
But, Blithe, the only hope you have is to accept the fact...

537
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,550
...that you're already dead.

538
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,760
And the sooner you accept that...

539
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,620
...the sooner you'll function...

540
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,790
...as a soldier's supposed to function.

541
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,760
Without mercy, without compassion...

542
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,230
...without remorse.

543
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,300
All war depends upon it.

544
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,650
Got any smokes?

545
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,620
Want this candy shit?

546
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,710
No, I'm all right.

547
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,290
The outpost got ammo.

548
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,420
Here you go, guys.

549
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,620
No, we don't know what they've got.

550
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,600
We may be attacking a weaker force...

551
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,220
...possibly more paratroopers.

552
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,030
And you know how they can be.

553
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,570
Fire and maneuver.

554
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,070
That's the name of the game, fire and maneuver.

555
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,200
Dog and Fox Companies will be on our left flank, moving with us.

556
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,800
Any questions?

557
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,900
Let's make them holler.

558
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,040
It's 9:30 in the evening back home.

559
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,440
Must be.

560
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,990
Mortar!

561
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,680
Incoming!

562
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,920
Down, down, down, down!

563
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,830
Get that OP in!

564
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,820
Tell them to hold, I'm checking the lines.

565
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,660
All Easy stations, Easy Six.

566
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,960
Hold in position, over.

567
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,830
Go, lock and load!

568
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,640
Easy Six, Easy Red Six.

569
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,470
I've got mortars all across my line.

570
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,110
No sign of infantry yet.

571
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,910
I'm pulling the OP in, over.

572
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,610
Right plus 15, charge three.

573
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,950
Range, 600.

574
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,860
Come on, move it, move it, hurry!

575
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,140
Watch for silhouettes on the horizon!

576
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,210
Keep low, go, go, go!

577
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,180
Perconte!

578
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,390
Get your men in order!

579
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,880
Stay low!

580
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,480
Pour it at them, Perconte.

581
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,720
To your left.

582
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,550
Keep going, keep going.

583
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,060
Keep it up!

584
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,430
I want fire superiority!

585
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,200
Guarnere, keep them pinned down.

586
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,830
Keep firing!

587
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,700
Sir, just reverse!

588
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,470
Cover the crest of that hill!

589
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,540
Where in the hell did they come from?

590
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Holy shit, there goes our left flank!

591
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,760
Sir, Dog and Fox are pulling back.

592
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,420
What?

593
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,570
Who gave that order, God damn it?

594
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,410
Keep firing, stay low!

595
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,610
Stay low, keep firing, Perconte.

596
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,150
Come on, Blithe!

597
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,920
Stand up!

598
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,090
Get up on your feet, soldier.

599
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,860
Get up, Blithe.

600
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,060
That's right, Blithe.

601
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,900
You can do it!

602
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,830
Fire your weapon, Blithe.

603
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,830
Hit those goddamn Germans, Blithe!

604
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,490
Keep firing!

605
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,750
Let them have it.

606
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,060
Keep firing!

607
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,790
Don't slack it off.

608
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,560
Let them have it, Blithe!

609
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,360
Pour it on them, Blithe!

610
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,610
Get some men up there!

611
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,580
Move it!

612
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,590
Let's go, McGrath, on me.

613
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,530
Shift your fire right.

614
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,930
Down, down!

615
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,480
Come on!

616
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,580
You're gonna get me killed, Lieutenant.

617
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,180
I knew you'd get me killed.

618
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,020
Don't fire till I tell you, McGrath.

619
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,890
I knew you were gonna get me killed.

620
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,950
Hold your fire!

621
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,430
No, that's too close!

622
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,070
Bitch, son of a bitch!

623
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,970
Medic!

624
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,280
Go now.

625
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,150
Now, fire, McGrath!

626
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,280
Fire!

627
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,090
Covering fire!

628
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,930
Keep firing south.

629
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,370
You hit a home run, huh?

630
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,630
Smith, I've been hit.

631
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,500
Just get me out of here!

632
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,250
Medic!

633
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,620
You okay?

634
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,630
Move it, move it!

635
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,130
Rounds complete!

636
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,360
Rounds complete!

637
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,770
Skip, more ammo!

638
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,970
Go, go!

639
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,130
On my way.

640
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,480
Medic!

641
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,920
Jesus, what was that?

642
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,530
Shermans.

643
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,560
Well, hello, 2nd Armored.

644
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,230
That's right, you sorry asses.

645
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,710
Run!

646
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,820
Oh, you beautiful babies, you!

647
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,280
Let's go!

648
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,480
Pour it on them!

649
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,720
Let them have it, come on!

650
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,970
Check it out, Shermans.

651
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,030
About damn time.

652
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,450
Come on!

653
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,030
Come on.

654
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,890
Come on.

655
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,510
Go to Lt. Kick their ass. Don't let them rest.

656
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,320
Hey, buddy?

657
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,880
Hey, buddy, you okay?

658
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,230
Looks like you fellows had a heck of a fight.

659
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,310
Move forward on the right flank.

660
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,960
We need to know what's in there.

661
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,760
I don't know who the hell to send.

662
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,140
Ask for volunteers.

663
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,300
I hate asking for volunteers.

664
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,110
Then pick them.

665
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,110
Need to take a look at that farmhouse.

666
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,480
Who wants to go?

667
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,790
I'll go.

668
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,460
Anybody else?

669
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,520
Martin, Dukeman, you just volunteered.

670
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,500
Hubba-hubba.

671
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,430
I'll be lead.

672
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,000
Blithe's lead scout, move out.

673
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,770
Harry...

674
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,790
...what exactly are you doing with your reserve chute?

675
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,880
You been hauling that thing around ever since we jumped?

676
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,320
Gonna send it to Kitty when we get back to England.

677
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,590
Silk.

678
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,900
Figure it'll make a good wedding dress, you know?

679
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,660
What with rationing and all.

680
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,210
Jeez, Harry, I never would have guessed.

681
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,900
What?

682
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,310
That I'm so sentimental?

683
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,280
No, that you think we're gonna make it back to England.

684
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,840
Okay.

685
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,970
Here we go again.

686
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,410
Covering fire, covering fire!

687
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,610
Go, go!

688
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,780
Hang in there, Blithe.

689
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,620
Come on.

690
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,420
Keep moving down!

691
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:47,920
Medic here!

692
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,620
Top window right!

693
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,820
Hang in there.

694
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,570
Medic!

695
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,400
We need a medic down here!

696
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,130
Cease fire, cease fire!

697
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,300
Take it easy, Blithe.

698
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,360
Take it easy.

699
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,880
Come on, Duke, come on.

700
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,180
Move, move.

701
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,840
Coming through, give me room.

702
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,410
Out of my way.

703
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,650
I got it.

704
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,750
What happened?

705
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,110
Sniper.

706
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,120
All right, Blithe, I got you.

707
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,590
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

708
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,820
They're pulling us off the front line.

709
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,790
Now?

710
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,120
To a field camp north of Utah Beach.

711
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,360
Hot food.

712
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,830
And showers.

713
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,460
Then back to England.

714
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,100
Harry.

715
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,510
How's the leg?

716
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,440
Stiff. Sore.

717
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,610
They want me to take it easy for a few days.

718
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,050
Yeah, you should.

719
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,150
Talked to Colonel Sink.

720
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,490
Said he appreciated Easy holding the line.

721
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,790
Said General Taylor was pleased.

722
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,830
That's why I came to France.

723
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,500
To please General Taylor.

724
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,800
Yeah.

725
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,720
In grateful acknowledgement...

726
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,120
...of the bloodshed in service of your country...

727
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,150
...it is my honor to present you...

728
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,550
...with the order of the Purple Heart.

729
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,050
Thank you, sir.

730
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,770
How many's that make?

731
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,670
Two?

732
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,970
Three?

733
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,540
You have no shame.

734
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,670
Hey, I got one hole in my shoulder...

735
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,250
...a second in my calf...

736
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,410
...and a boil on my shin that had to be lanced.

737
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,920
And he only gets one.

738
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,690
This is great.

739
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,950
She fancied me, Alton.

740
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,990
Jesus Christ!

741
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,870
It's good to be alive!

742
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,550
Jesus Christ, that sure was close.

743
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,710
Nah, missed him by a mile.

744
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,310
Hey, Hoobler.

745
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,620
Be quiet for the man.

746
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,220
What?

747
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,280
The Night of the Bayonet.

748
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,660
"The night was filled with dark and cold

749
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,160
"When Sergeant Talbert

750
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,160
"The story's told, pulled on his poncho

751
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,500
"And headed out

752
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,060
"To check the lines dressed like a Kraut"

753
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,700
Why is everyone in such a hurry to get back?

754
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,440
Hospital food don't suit you?

755
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,030
We don't need you anymore.

756
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,910
"Upon a trooper our hero came

757
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,370
"Fast asleep, he called his name

758
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,810
"Oh, Smith

759
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,580
"Get up, it's time

760
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,850
To take your turn out on the line"

761
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,420
Do you guys have any idea what he's talking about?

762
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,890
The Night of the Bayonet.

763
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,760
Whatever that is.

764
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,160
"So very weary

765
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,500
"Cracked an eye, all red and bleary

766
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,300
"Grabbed his rifle, he did not tarry

767
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,740
"Hearing Floyd but seeing Jerry"

768
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,400
Way to go, Smithy.

769
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,880
"'It's me,' cried Tab

770
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,000
"'Don't do it,' and yet Smith charged

771
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,740
"Tout de suite, with bayonet

772
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,310
"He lunged, he thrust, both high and low

773
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,090
"And skewered the boy from Kokomo"

774
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,080
I'm heading back to barracks.

775
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,320
You Heffron?

776
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,260
Yeah.

777
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,390
Where you from?

778
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,790
Who's asking?

779
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,360
You from Philadelphia?

780
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:30,930
South Philly, yeah.

781
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,330
I could tell.

782
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,860
17th Street.

783
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,870
Front Street.

784
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,430
Hey.

785
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,800
Come here, sit down.

786
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,600
Hey, you know a guy named Johnny Waylon?

787
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,110
Yeah, I know Johnny.

788
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,410
Yeah, tar-head, yeah.

789
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,210
As you weren't wounded by the enemy...

790
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,610
...and thus didn't qualify for a Purple Heart...

791
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,950
...we've taken matters into our own hands.

792
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,110
Tab, this is for you.

793
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,950
That's right.

794
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,970
I could have shot the kid a dozen times.

795
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:04,830
Yeah, right.

796
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,660
I just didn't think we could spare a man.

797
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,310
Couple of announcements, men.

798
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,110
First, listen up.

799
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,480
First, the training exercise scheduled for 2200 has been cancelled.

800
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,420
Oh, yeah.

801
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:30,750
Secondly...

802
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,820
...all passes are hereby revoked.

803
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,300
We're heading back to France.

804
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,760
So, pack up all your gear.

805
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,300
We will not be returning to England, boys.

806
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,160
Anyone who has not made out a will...

807
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,370
...go to the supply office.

808
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,600
The trucks depart for Membury at 0700.

809
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,740
As you were.

810
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,650
Hello?

811
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,960
Hello?

812
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,550
Good morning, Miss Lamb.

813
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,960
Sorry to bother you so early.

814
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,650
That's all right.

815
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,250
Private...

816
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,060
Malarkey.

817
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,490
Come in.

818
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,960
Actually, it's Sergeant Malarkey now, ma'am. I just got promoted.

819
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,090
Oh, lovely.

820
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,640
I expect you want your laundry.

821
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,230
I heard the trucks rumbling by all night.

822
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,600
I guess the Yanks must be on their way off again.

823
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,370
Yes, ma'am.

824
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,930
Looks like for good this time.

825
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,710
I'm sorry to hear that.

826
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,440
Two shirts, two pairs of trousers...

827
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,640
...light starch.

828
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,840
Two bob and tuppence, please.

829
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,880
Thank you.

830
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,590
Thank you.

831
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,460
Would you like a cup of tea?

832
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,000
I've got the water boiling.

833
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,330
No, no, thank you.

834
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,870
I'm in a hell of a...

835
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,900
...bit of a hurry but thank you anyway.

836
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,710
Oh, Private?

837
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:57,980
Yes, ma'am.

838
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,510
Lieutenant Meehan's one of yours, isn't he?

839
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,480
I hope he hasn't forgotten his laundry.

840
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,360
I'll take it.

841
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:12,860
Thank you.

842
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,330
You, you couldn't be a dear...

843
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,710
...and help me with a few others, could you?

844
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,880
Let's see.

845
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,570
Sergeant Evans.

846
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,510
Private Moya.

847
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,980
Blowzer.

848
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,090
Gray.

849
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,680
Miller.

850
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,620
Owen.

851
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,630
Collins.

852
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,460
Elliot.

853
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,650
Blithe.
