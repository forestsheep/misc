1
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,440
It was more than three years since Lewis Nixon and I...

2
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,780
...decided to join the paratroops.

3
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,320
And more than a year since we'd first gone to war...

4
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,340
...not knowing what would happen to us.

5
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,450
How long we'd be fighting where we'd end up.

6
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,920
I certainly didn't expect to find myself in a place like this.

7
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,230
I thought it might be you.

8
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,570
'Morning.

9
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,340
I heard reports about a red-headed Eskimo.

10
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,740
Thought I'd check it out.

11
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Come to join me for a morning swim?

12
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,680
Yeah. You know me so well.

13
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,150
Here, it's from Zielinski.

14
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,590
Oh, great.

15
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,630
What is that?

16
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,330
Ran into the regimental photographer.

17
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,970
Said he had all these photographs of the 506th...

18
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,340
...going all the way back to Toccoa.

19
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,670
I traded them for a couple of Lugers.

20
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,900
That's a bargain.

21
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,620
What do you think you'll do after this?

22
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,590
Get some breakfast.

23
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,560
No, after, after.

24
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,890
Well, it's funny you should mention it...

25
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,490
...'cause I had a meeting with Colonel Sink.

26
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,900
Really?

27
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,700
Yeah.

28
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,740
Yeah, he and I discussed the possibility of staying.

29
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,310
In the Army?

30
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,810
Yeah.

31
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,710
Yeah, as a career.

32
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,080
What'd you say?

33
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,310
I said I'd think about it.

34
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,030
What do you think about New Jersey?

35
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,800
New Jersey?

36
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,930
There's a company in Nixon, New Jersey.

37
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,910
It's called "Nixon Nitration Works".

38
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,100
Sounds picturesque.

39
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,230
Yeah, well, oddly enough I know the owners.

40
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,710
Probably gonna expect me to make something of myself.

41
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,050
I thought maybe I'd drag you with me.

42
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,510
Are you offering me a job?

43
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,690
We'll see how you do in your interview...

44
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,290
...but, you know, a man of your qualifications...

45
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,200
...I think we can probably scrape something up. Commensurate with your current salary level.

46
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,970
Yeah, I'll think about it.

47
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,870
I really appreciate it.

48
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,420
Yeah, just think about it.

49
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,640
Yeah.

50
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,120
Job offers. Hard to fathom.

51
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,720
And the war wasn't even over.

52
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,390
I was still getting used to hot showers and morning swims.

53
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,060
We'd entered Bavaria in early May...

54
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,930
...with the hopes of capturing Berchtesgaden.

55
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,680
This famous town, high in the Alps...

56
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,150
...was the Nazi party's symbolic home...

57
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,410
...and all the heads of the Third Reich had houses there.

58
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,310
Although Hitler was dead, he had apparently ordered the SS to make it their last stand...

59
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,080
...from which to mount a guerrilla resistance against the Allied advance.

60
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,490
The first step was blocking the roads.

61
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,500
When are we expecting the engineers to arrive?

62
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,830
Half an hour ago.

63
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,100
We're stuck here until they do, Nix.

64
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,030
Well, if you're the SS...

65
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,670
...you're not gonna let us waltz into Hitler's house.

66
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,870
Probably throw a few rocks at us yourself.

67
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,470
If you want someone to find a way up that mountain...

68
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,910
...Easy Company is ready.

69
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,510
Duly noted.

70
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,570
I already recommended you to Colonel Sink.

71
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,520
Let's go find out where Hitler lived.

72
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,850
Ron, we're not sure what's up there.

73
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,380
The Colonel doesn't want us taking any unnecessary risks.

74
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,430
So, the French are gonna beat us to the Eagle's Nest.

75
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,140
Gents, I just had a conversation with General Leclerc.

76
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,800
He said he was first into Paris...

77
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,940
...and by God he wanted to be first into Berchtesgaden.

78
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,540
Told him I understood his point.

79
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,650
You fire up 2nd battalion and outflank that French son of a bitch.

80
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,280
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,900
I want Easy Company in the lead.

82
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,520
Have the men assemble on the highway.

83
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,690
Yes, sir.

84
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,100
Eerie. Not even any natives.

85
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,340
That's 'cause this is the one town you can't deny being a true Nazi.

86
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,070
What do you mean?

87
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,310
Well, you have to be to live here.

88
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,080
Need to find some place we can put the Colonel.

89
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,780
How about right there?

90
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,480
No, no.

91
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,010
Kitty would love this.

92
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,650
How many brides get a wedding present from Hitler?

93
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,780
You wanna take half?

94
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't carry all this.

95
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,620
You know, whoever comes in here after us...

96
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,890
...is gonna take whatever isn't nailed down.

97
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,190
Well...

98
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,290
...wouldn't want that to happen.

99
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,030
Nice.

100
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,830
Don't even think about it.

101
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Major Winters. Sir.

102
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,010
More.

103
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,080
Permission to climb the mountain, sir?

104
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,050
Eagle's Nest?

105
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,380
What is this?

106
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,890
Wait one minute.

107
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,990
Harry, have F Company put a double guard on the hotel. Set up roadblocks on the west side of town.

108
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,220
I want battalion HQ, seal off the north side and prepare for prisoners.

109
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,320
Sergeant Grant.

110
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,160
And, Harry, nobody gets hurt, not now.

111
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,540
And Easy?

112
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,900
Easy will head up the mountain through the Obersalzburg...

113
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,880
...and take the Eagle's Nest.

114
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,270
Hi-ho, Silver!

115
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,190
The Eagle's Nest was a surprise birthday present for Hitler...

116
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,250
...built with Nazi party money.

117
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,760
A mountaintop stone retreat 8,000 feet up...

118
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,270
...accessible by a gold-plated elevator.

119
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,160
It was one of the crown jewels of his empire...

120
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,860
...and the man was afraid of heights.

121
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,880
Here's to him.

122
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,660
No, goddamn it, listen.

123
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,890
Hitler, Hitler, no.

124
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,600
Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels.

125
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,690
and the pope walk into a bar...

126
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,260
- Because he drinks too much... - That's how it starts.

127
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,280
Hey, Adolf. Love your Eagle's Nest.

128
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,280
I hope you don't mind. We made ourselves at home.

129
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,910
Love what you've done with it.

130
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,580
Hey, hey, have a drink. Come on.

131
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,020
Just so as we can say we saw you do it.

132
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,620
Listen up.

133
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,420
From Corps, just came in.

134
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,690
Effective immediately.

135
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,320
All troops stand fast on present positions.

136
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,060
Standing fast.

137
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,230
Wanna hear it?

138
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,600
Ready for it, listen up. The German army surrendered.

139
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,680
I got a present for you, come on.

140
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,580
- Is it? - yeah.

141
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,970
- What is this place? - Hermann Goering's house.

142
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,640
We discovered it yesterday. Had it on double guard ever since.

143
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,680
I can vouch for that.

144
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,810
Oh, anxious to get off duty, O'Keefe?

145
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
No, there's just so much to see and do, sir.

146
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,980
Ten thousand bottles of the world's finest liquor...

147
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,520
...wine, and champagne helped Easy Company mark the day the war in Europe came to an end.

148
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,190
It's all yours.

149
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,190
Take what you want and have each company take a truckload.

150
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,230
We're going to Austria in the morning. Don't feel obliged to leave stuff for whoever comes next.

151
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Austria, sir?

152
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,340
Happy V.E. Day.

153
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,430
Yeah.

154
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,330
V.E. day?

155
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,980
Victory in Europe.

156
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,320
Happy V.E. Day.

157
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,450
Instead of an aggressive combat unit...

158
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,690
...we became an occupation force...

159
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,320
...and no one wanted to leave Berchtesgaden...

160
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,230
...until they saw Austria.

161
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,670
So, you reckon they'll make us run up those or ski down them?

162
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,050
Hey, how are you?

163
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,910
Need a hand there?

164
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,050
He loves you!

165
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,500
Hey, lady, how are you?

166
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,100
I think the war is over.

167
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,400
We'll be comfortable here.

168
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,400
I wonder what will happen to us...

169
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,700
...to people like you and me when there are finally no more wars to occupy us.

170
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,680
Have all your men collect the weapons...

171
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,420
...deposit them at the church, at the school, and at the airfield.

172
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,650
Very well.

173
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,490
Please accept this as my formal surrender, Major.

174
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,130
It is better than to lay it on the desk of a clerk.

175
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,540
You may keep your sidearm, Colonel.

176
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,630
Heroic dead of a combined army and marine force mark the grim battlefield of Okinawa...

177
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,960
...where one of the worst battles of the war is being fought.

178
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,430
Thousands of Yanks have been wounded or sacrificed their lives...

179
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,910
...to drive a fanatical foe from this base.

180
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,410
Along the Jap's southern defense line...

181
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,810
...the Yanks progress slowly facing one of the fiercest artillery barrages of the war.

182
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,580
Each small advance is gained by sheer grit...

183
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,920
...in the face of withering fire from a suicidal enemy...

184
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,960
...being slowly hammered back into the hills.

185
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,720
The going is brutal and our casualties are high...

186
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,490
...but Okinawa is the next big step towards victory over Japan.

187
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,960
A victory that can only be won by work...

188
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,230
...war bonds, and heroic sacrifice.

189
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,440
- So, when are we going? - We don't have a date yet.

190
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,870
Are we to tell the men right away?

191
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,870
Some of them will have enough points to go home instead.

192
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,540
Not many if their only medal's a Purple Heart.

193
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,690
I think most of us here will have enough.

194
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,780
And each of us will have to decide what to do.

195
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,490
I don't know how long we're waiting here for orders...

196
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,090
...but I want those veterans who are staying...

197
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,790
...and all new replacements, ready to fight.

198
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,470
That means rifle ranges.

199
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,500
That means daily close order drills. That means troop reviews...

200
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,630
...but, above all, it means physical training.

201
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,900
Get your NCOs on it.

202
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,100
They're gonna love you.

203
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,980
What are you crouching down for, Perco?

204
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,050
Think the deer's gonna shoot back?

205
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,420
Leave me alone.

206
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,380
How about you all just shut up...

207
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,750
...and let Shifty kill us some dinner?

208
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,290
What's the matter, Bull?

209
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,160
You tired of eating dried up spuds three times a day?

210
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,020
Hey, you know what, I got an idea. Why don't we just shoot Bull here...

211
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,260
...and feed the company for a week?

212
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,490
Oh, goddamn it, Shifty.

213
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,190
You let him get away. Army ought to be glad to be rid of you.

214
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,330
I wish, you know. It seems they want me to stay around awhile.

215
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,830
- Are you serious? - How many points you need?

216
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,930
Fifteen.

217
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,010
Fifteen! Jesus Christ, I thought I had it bad.

218
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,640
No Purple Hearts, never was injured.

219
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,750
Company! Platoon! Attention!

220
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,890
Right shoulder. Arm!

221
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,260
Order. Arms!

222
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,490
At ease.

223
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,640
General Taylor is aware that many veterans...

224
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,470
...including Normandy veterans...

225
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,940
...still do not have the 85 points required to be discharged.

226
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,910
On this the anniversary of D-day...

227
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,070
...he has authorized a lottery to send...

228
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,080
...one man home in each company...

229
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,880
...effective immediately.

230
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,850
For Easy Company, the winner is...

231
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,750
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

232
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Serial number 13066266.

233
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,970
Sergeant Darrell C. Powers.

234
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,070
Shifty

235
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,170
That's how it's done, Shifty.

236
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,040
Congratulations, Shifty.

237
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,670
Sergeant Grant will see to it that 2nd Platoon takes over at the crossroads checkpoint...

238
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,050
...beginning tonight at 2200 hours.

239
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,750
- So much for our anniversary. - No shit.

240
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,060
General Taylor has also announced that the 101st Airborne Division...

241
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,100
...will definitely be redeployed to the Pacific.

242
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,760
So, beginning tomorrow, at 0600 hours...

243
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,200
...we will begin training to go to war.

244
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,770
Come in.

245
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,910
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir.

246
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,120
I just wanted to say goodbye.

247
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,060
You know, you was...

248
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,490
You was...

249
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,630
Well...

250
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,360
It's been a long time.

251
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,630
You got everything you need?

252
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,670
Yes, sir.

253
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,440
I gathered up my loot. Pistols mainly.

254
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,210
Paperwork's all done. I even got my back pay in my pocket.

255
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,920
Back, back home in Virginia...

256
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,780
Well...

257
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,220
I just don't rightly know how I'm gonna explain all this.

258
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
You see, I've...

259
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,870
I've seen... I've seen...

260
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,410
You're a hell of a fine soldier, Shifty.

261
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,710
There's nothing more to explain.

262
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,550
Thank you, sir.

263
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,230
Two days later, Shifty Powers was on a truck headed for the rear and a boat home.

264
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,230
Unfortunately the truck was hit head-on by a drunken corporal from another regiment.

265
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,170
Shifty had a broken pelvis...

266
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,800
...a broken arm, and a bad concussion.

267
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,110
He survived, but spent the next few months in a series of hospitals.

268
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,480
I wish I could say that he was our only casualty in Austria.

269
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,910
I've made up my mind, Nix.

270
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,250
I got the points, I'm going back to Kitty.

271
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,850
Harry, do you really think that Kitty hasn't run off with some 4-F by now?

272
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,420
Son of a bitch. That's not even funny.

273
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,080
Harry, ignore him.

274
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,960
How am I supposed to tell her I had the chance to go home to her finally...

275
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,500
...but decided not to, so I could go jump on Tokyo?

276
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,900
All right, so don't tell her.

277
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,800
Besides, she's waited for you for three years, right?

278
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,530
We'll be to Tokyo and back in two years, three tops.

279
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,770
It'll probably be over before you even get there.

280
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,870
The reality is you're gonna sit here in Austria for six months waiting to go...

281
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,540
...and I'm gonna be back in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

282
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,780
- You didn't tell him? - No, I couldn't get him to shut up.

283
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
What, tell me what?

284
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,320
Guts and Glory here applied for a transfer.

285
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,550
What?

286
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,990
13th Airborne are heading out for the Pacific right away.

287
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,500
If I'm going, I wanna get it over with.

288
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,200
Are you in on this too?

289
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,310
I can't let him go by himself. He doesn't know where it is.

290
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,610
You're leaving the men?

291
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,910
They don't need me anymore.

292
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,580
Wounded in Normandy?

293
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,930
Yes, sir. In the leg. It was a minor flesh wound.

294
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,300
Company E lost 24 men killed there.

295
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,760
Yes, sir.

296
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,100
Seventeen of those were in my company commander's plane. It went down on D-day.

297
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,600
So, you were given command of the company on D-day?

298
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,440
That's right.

299
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,690
Fall back to your original positions!

300
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,250
Everyone else maintain your pace of fire!

301
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,030
In Holland they bumped you to battalion XO.

302
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,640
Yes, sir.

303
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,040
Bastards took your company away.

304
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,710
I fired my last shots there.

305
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,440
For the whole damn war?

306
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,710
Yes, sir.

307
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,450
You got through Bastogne without having to fire your weapon?

308
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,510
That is correct, sir.

309
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,860
And you were on the line the whole time?

310
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,150
Yes, sir.

311
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,060
Can't imagine a tougher test for a leader...

312
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,970
...having to sit through a siege like that under those conditions.

313
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,000
We got through it.

314
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,500
Find some cover, find a foxhole!

315
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,070
Come on, take cover! Take cover!

316
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,540
Come on, find some cover!

317
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,490
Why do you want a transfer?

318
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,250
Sorry, sir?

319
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,050
I said, why do you want to leave your men?

320
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,220
It's not that, sir.

321
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,160
It's just that if the war was still on in the Pacific...

322
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,220
...and I could do some good over there.

323
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,140
Looking to have your own division someday?

324
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,670
No, sir.

325
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,100
Not going to make a career of the army?

326
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,300
No. Well, I don't know, sir.

327
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,810
Because if you think you need more combat experience...

328
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,250
...to get stars on your helmet...

329
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,650
...let me tell you something, son.

330
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,820
You've done enough.

331
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,950
Thank you, sir. That's not my objective.

332
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,230
Major, I took this meeting out of respect for your achievements and for the 101st.

333
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,940
If they do go to the Pacific eventually you should be running one of the battalions.

334
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,110
Thank you, sir.

335
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,380
And frankly, your men have earned the right to keep you around.

336
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,290
Yes, sir.

337
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,850
Thank you, sir.

338
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,330
So, I would stay in Austria for the time being waiting for orders...

339
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,210
...and trying to watch over soldiers who had no enemy to fight.

340
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,250
Lieb, I fucking hate this.

341
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,040
Oh, Jesus Christ, they fingered him.

342
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,910
He was in the fucking room, Web.

343
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,520
A Polack who was at the slave camps said this is where he lives, here.

344
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,720
- Which camp? - Whatever camp.

345
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,320
I'm under direct orders and I'm happy to follow it.

346
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,870
Is this a personal thing, Joe?

347
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,780
What?

348
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,480
Is this personal to you?

349
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,280
No, it's a goddamn order.

350
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,150
Does Major Winters know about this?

351
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,520
Doesn't matter here.

352
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,950
Oh, the fuck it doesn't.

353
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,680
What if this guy's just a soldier?

354
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,950
What if he's an officer with no ties to the SS?

355
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,250
If he's innocent? You know...

356
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,130
...what if he's a fucking Nazi commandant of a slave camp?

357
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,700
Which one, which camp? You don't have any proof.

358
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,360
Were you at Landsberg?

359
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,170
You know I was.

360
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,040
You think he's a soldier like you and me?

361
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,370
A fucking innocent German officer?

362
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,040
Where the hell have you been for the past three years?

363
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,280
Wer sind Sie?

364
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,880
Was machen Sie hier?

365
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,980
What?

366
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,980
Ich habe gar nichts.

367
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,650
Shut up.

368
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,780
Was machen Sie?

369
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,750
Ruhe.

370
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,720
Sie sind der Kommandant.

371
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,950
Gehen Sie raus.

372
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,650
Sie sind der Kommandant.

373
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,790
Welcher Kommandant?

374
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,850
Vom Arbeitslager.

375
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,830
Ich weiss von keinem Arbeitslager.

376
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,730
Sie haben die falsche Person.

377
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,560
Nein, nein.

378
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,340
Don't fucking lie to me.

379
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,810
Sie tauschen sich.

380
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,870
See what you did to my fucking people?

381
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,470
Nein.

382
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,560
He's guilty.

383
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,500
- Liebgott says so. - He probably is.

384
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,310
Goddamn son of a bitch. Shoot him.

385
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,080
Shoot him!

386
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,250
No.

387
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,380
Officers don't run.

388
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,010
The war's over, anybody would run.

389
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,710
Summer in this Alpine paradise should have been a welcome relief...

390
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,590
...especially now that we were at peace with the Germans.

391
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,560
Everyone just wanted to go home.

392
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,420
France. France was the best.

393
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,120
Really?

394
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,430
Yeah, five years.

395
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,730
I think I was in every country, but France was the best.

396
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,410
Italy would be second for me.

397
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,380
Russia is not desirable. Ukraine, it was okay.

398
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,130
So, when do you get out?

399
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,240
The unit is discharged. We leave when my captain gets transferred.

400
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,740
It is the end of my second war.

401
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,040
Jesus.

402
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm going home now to Mannheim.

403
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,550
I'll take this one.

404
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,580
Passkarte, bitte.

405
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,920
Okay.

406
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,580
Hey, Webster.

407
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,420
- My relief. - Don't salute the Germans.

408
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,260
Come on. I sort of get a kick out of it.

409
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,490
Anyway, I got me a new enemy. The Japs.

410
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:57,200
75 points. How about you? I mean, you're a Toccoa guy, right?

411
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,040
- How many you got? - Wouldn't you like to know?

412
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,310
Discharged, huh?

413
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,570
- Go ahead, take off, it's my turn. - Okay, see you back at the farm.

414
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,980
Eighty-one.

415
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,780
What?

416
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,120
I have 81 points.

417
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,920
Well, that's just not good enough.

418
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,300
See about getting you a ride.

419
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,130
Hey!

420
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,370
Hey!

421
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,110
Where are they going?

422
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,770
Munich. Munchen, Munich.

423
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,740
Wanna go to Munich?

424
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
Mochten Sie nach Munchen gehen?

425
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,510
Ja, bitte.

426
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,750
Get in.

427
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,080
Too bad.

428
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,160
Turn the wheel!

429
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,730
Oh, Jesus.

430
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,180
It's Private Janovec.

431
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,620
He was dead when they brought him in.

432
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,920
75 points.

433
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,690
- What? - He was 10 points short.

434
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,990
The enemy had surrendered, but somehow men were still dying.

435
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,500
Young men, who wanted to be home with their families by now...

436
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,130
...who'd served with distinction since before Normandy...

437
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,800
...were stuck here because they didn't have the points.

438
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,340
What they did have plenty of were weapons, alcohol, and too much time on their hands.

439
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,910
When all of a sudden, from out of nowhere...

440
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,650
...a guy jumps out of the hedgerow...

441
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,980
...onto this guy's chest.

442
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,520
Shoves a trench knife up against his throat and screams, "Whose side are you on?"

443
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,490
I don't get it.

444
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,860
It's D-day.

445
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,460
It's 2nd platoon's own Bill Guarnere. Old' Gonorrhea himself.

446
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,500
Just landed in Normandy and wound up like I don't know what.

447
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,300
"Whose side are you on?" What a fucking character!

448
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,900
What happened to him?

449
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,240
Got his leg blown off in Bastogne.

450
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,970
Wait here.

451
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,350
Are you okay, Mac, do you need some help?

452
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,990
They wouldn't give me any gas.

453
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,990
Krauts.

454
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,230
I tried to explain.

455
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,930
This fucking limey wouldn't listen.

456
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,040
I think he was a Major.

457
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,650
Look, Private, we've got a problem here.

458
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,270
Do you have any gas?

459
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,280
Why don't you give me your weapon?

460
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,620
Well, I guess I'll just use his Jeep. I don't think he's gonna be needing it.

461
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,850
Hold on a second there, all right?

462
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,160
Jesus.

463
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,230
Sarge! Sergeant Grant!

464
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,030
Sarge!

465
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,680
Jesus.

466
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,410
What?

467
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,410
He's not gonna make it.

468
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,240
You can't operate on him?

469
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,080
Not me.

470
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,680
You'd need a brain surgeon.

471
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,880
And even if you had one, I don't think there's any hope.

472
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,620
Find the shooter. Alive. Come on, help me.

473
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,590
What are you doing?

474
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,860
We're gonna go find a brain surgeon.

475
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,900
Hey, Lieb. He wants a noncom guarding each roadblock...

476
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,160
...and two men watching every road out of town.

477
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,100
Bull, Malark, you each pick a squad...

478
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,230
...and one witness on a house to house search.

479
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,470
Can we shoot this bastard on sight?

480
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,310
Try and take him alive.

481
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,780
Where's Grant now?

482
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,780
They took him to a Kraut hospital...

483
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,650
...to see if they could drum up any good doctors.

484
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,120
Open up.

485
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,490
Come with me.

486
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,600
Why?

487
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,630
Get in the Jeep.

488
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,100
Where're we going?

489
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,870
To the hospital, get in.

490
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,840
If you're going to shoot me, shoot me.

491
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,670
If you're not, put the gun away.

492
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,740
Get in the Jeep, now.

493
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,240
- What happened to him? - He was shot in the head.

494
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,550
Half hour ago. Come on.

495
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,060
If you want him to live, you'll help me.

496
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,180
First by putting that away.

497
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,260
- Let's go. - Let me drive.

498
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,130
We'll get there faster.

499
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,840
Jesus. Again, what a hand.

500
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,840
I don't know who's taking a bigger beating, me or him.

501
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,390
Wanna play a different game?

502
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,980
No.

503
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,520
Same game, just shuffle them up good, huh?

504
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,620
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right.

505
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,020
You wanna go in there and join in?

506
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,200
I should go in there and stop this.

507
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,970
Floyd, let's just play cards, all right?

508
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,350
Where is he?

509
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,440
How's Grant?

510
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,310
Is he okay?

511
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,180
This him?

512
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,320
That's him.

513
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,130
Replacement I Company.

514
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,340
Where's the weapon?

515
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,070
What weapon?

516
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,410
When you talk to an officer, you say "sir."

517
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,850
Have the MPs take care of this piece of shit.

518
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,960
- Grant's dead? - No.

519
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,530
Kraut surgeon says he's gonna make it.

520
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,170
Hey, tough guy, on your feet. Come on, move, move it.

521
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm guessing they were Hitler's photo albums, sir.

522
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,310
Sure had a lot of pictures of him in it.

523
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,880
You looked at them, but you didn't take them?

524
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,080
That's right, sir.

525
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,710
I don't believe you.

526
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,820
I'll be watching you.

527
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,830
You're dismissed.

528
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,060
You'd better not be lying to me.

529
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,500
What?

530
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,740
Sir, if it's not gonna put you in too much of a bind...

531
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,170
...I'd like to resign as Company 1st Sergeant.

532
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,540
If I had my choice I miss being back amongst the men.

533
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,890
I'd be happy to go to Staff Sergeant whichever platoon you wanna put me in.

534
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,190
Well, I guess you've earned your right to demote yourself.

535
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,090
Thank you, sir.

536
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,030
You wanna take over Sergeant Grant's platoon?

537
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,800
That would do fine, sir.

538
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,870
All right then, report to Lieutenant Peacock.

539
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,210
Let me know if he gives you any trouble.

540
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,110
Oh, sir, you make your decision yet?

541
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,520
Yeah, I did.

542
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,460
So, what else is on your mind?

543
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,860
I know Easy Company's gonna need a Commanding Officer post-war.

544
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,170
Somebody to hold their hand keep them from killing each other.

545
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,170
It better be somebody who knows what they're doing.

546
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,670
Yep, I couldn't agree more.

547
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,000
It's absolutely irresponsible to leave them in the hands of the wrong person.

548
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,210
They're too much of a valuable resource to the military.

549
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,890
So, you've decided to stay in the army?

550
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,410
Yes, I'm gonna stay with the men.

551
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,420
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

552
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,900
So, some of us would stay by choice...

553
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,430
...but others were stuck if we couldn't find excuses to send them away.

554
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,160
So, it's an airborne exhibition.

555
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,440
They have one of every Allied combat plane they've used in the war.

556
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,910
I mean, yes, sir.

557
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,970
You'll be like a technical adviser to make sure they get everything right.

558
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,170
I understand, sir.

559
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,010
I'm sorry it's not a more hospitable location.

560
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,780
No, sir. Paris is just fine.

561
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,890
You know, if you need me to go...

562
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,580
- ...someone must be there. - Yeah, we do, we absolutely do.

563
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,760
And your driver will drop you off at a hotel of your choice.

564
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:42,420
And I don't think we'll see you back here any time soon.

565
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,330
I won't let you down, sir.

566
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,250
Carwood, yes.

567
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,880
I wanted to say...

568
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,080
...as you probably know...

569
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,020
...when they give a man a battlefield commission make him an officer...

570
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,650
...they usually don't let him stay with the same company.

571
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,090
Yes, sir, I figured this was coming.

572
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,330
Yeah, they're afraid the men won't show him the proper degree of respect as they would another officer.

573
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,830
It's a good theory, sir.

574
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
It's an idiotic theory especially in your case.

575
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,870
Nevertheless, they've given me the choice as to where to re-assign you...

576
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,910
...and I thought battalion headquarters might be a good place.

577
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,240
I can think of few better, sir.

578
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:38,710
Good.

579
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,120
Good.

580
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,750
Right now, down at the airfield there is a German general who is a little POed...

581
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,150
...about having to surrender to a private from South Philly.

582
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,430
- Thinks it's beneath his stature. - Understandable, sir.

583
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah. I thought 2nd Lieutenant Carwood Lipton from West Virginia...

584
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,260
...could soothe his ruffled feathers.

585
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,800
No problem, sir.

586
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,610
Major, is this the type of job I can expect from now on?

587
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,640
Yeah. Yeah.

588
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,270
When we're not sunning ourselves by the lake.

589
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,590
Lieutenant.

590
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,270
With your permission, I would like to address my men briefly.

591
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,100
That'll be fine, General.

592
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,050
Captain Sobel.

593
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,350
- Major Winters. - Captain Sobel.

594
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,550
We salute the rank, not the man.

595
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,030
Manner...

596
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,570
...es war ein langer Krieg.

597
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,640
Es war ein harter Krieg.

598
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,940
Liebgott?

599
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,550
Men, it's been a long war, it's been a tough war.

600
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,610
lhr habt tapfer und stolz fur euer Vaterland gekampft.

601
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,550
You have fought bravely, proudly for your country.

602
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,590
lhr seid eine besondere Gruppe...

603
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,790
You are a special group...

604
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,360
...die ineinander einen Zusammenhalt gefunden habt...

605
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,460
...who have found in one another a bond...

606
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,010
...wie er sich nur im Kampf entwickeln kann.

607
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,040
...that exists only in combat.

608
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,900
Unter Kameraden...

609
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,240
Among brothers...

610
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,440
...die Fuchshohlen geteilt haben.

611
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,380
...of shared foxholes.

612
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,980
Die sich in schrecklichen Momenten...

613
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,020
...gegenseitig geschtutzt haben.

614
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,490
Held each other in dire moments.

615
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,650
Die den Tod zusammen gesehen haben.

616
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:19,900
Und gemeinsam gelitten haben.

617
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,430
Who've seen death and suffered together.

618
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,240
Ich bin stolz...

619
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,770
...mit euch gedient zu haben.

620
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,870
I am proud to have served with each and every one of you.

621
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,510
Sie alle verdienen ein langes und gluckliches...

622
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,570
...Leben in Frieden.

623
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,520
You deserve long and happy lives of peace.

624
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,030
Towel, towel, towel, towel, towel.

625
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,060
Thanks.

626
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,410
Take a look at these two kids.

627
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,670
What the hell happened to them?

628
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,970
New Jersey, huh?

629
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,110
Yeah.

630
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,410
Think about it.

631
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,350
Yeah, I am.

632
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,410
You awake yet?

633
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,150
Awake?

634
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,560
Time to go to bed.

635
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,780
Bad luck, Jimmy.

636
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,310
Nice play.

637
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,810
Come on, we got one down.

638
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,080
Come on, Pee Wee, let's get Webster.

639
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,860
Buck Compton came back to see the Company. To let us know that he was all right.

640
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,290
He became a prosecutor in Los Angeles.

641
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,820

...and was later appointed to the California Court of Appeals.

00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,440
In 1961, he went out on the ocean alone...

646
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,010
...and was never seen again.

647
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,310
Go, go, go!

648
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,050
Johnny Martin would return to his job at the railroad...

649
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,180
...and then start his own construction company.

650
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,460
He splits his time between Arizona and a place in Montana.

651
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,930
George Luz became a handyman in Providence, Rhode Island...

652
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,660
...and as a testament to his character...

653
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,070
...1600 people attended his funeral 1998.

654
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,970
Doc Roe died in Louisiana in 1998.

655
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,050

...and drove his cab.

659

Bull Randleman was one of the best soldiers I ever had.

660
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,870
He went into the earth-moving business in Arkansas.

661
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,680
He's still there.

662
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,850
Alton More returned to Wyoming with a unique souvenir...

663
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,190
...Hitler's personal photo albums.

664
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,980
He was killed in a car accident in 1958.

665
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,860
Floyd Talbert, we all lost touch with in civilian life...

666
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,830
...until he showed up at a reunion just before his death in 1981.

667
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,810
How we lived our lives after the war was as varied as each man.

668
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,370
Carwood Lipton became a glass-making executive...

669
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,850

675
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,830
He retired a Lieutenant Colonel.

676
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,040
Get them round.

677
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,110
Easy Company, school circle!

678
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,490
For Easy Company, it was D-day plus 434.

679
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,960
A fast man would've had it, Perco.

680
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,360
Listen up, got some news.

681
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:15,460
This morning President Truman received the unconditional surrender from the Japanese.

682
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,590
War's over.

683
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,300
Regardless of points, medals, or wounds...

684
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,710
...each man in the 101st Airborne would be going home.

685
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,810
Each of us would be forever connected by our shared experience.

686
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,840
And each would have to rejoin the world as best he could.

687
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,540
War is over

688
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,570
Lewis Nixon had some tough times after the war.

689
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,970
He was divorced a couple of times.

690
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,070
Then in 1956, he married a woman named Grace and everything came together for him.

691
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,210
He spent the rest of his life with her, traveling the world.

692
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,310
My friend, Lew, died in 1995.

693
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:16,090
I took up his job offer and was a personnel manager at the Nixon nitration works until I was called back...

694
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,150
...into service in 1950 to train officers and rangers...

695
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,620
...but I chose not to go to Korea. I'd had enough of war.

696
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,930
I stayed around Hershey, Pennsylvania finally finding a little farm.

697
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,400
A little peaceful corner of the world...

698
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,300
...where I still live today.

699
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:38,500
And there is not a day that goes by that I do not think of the men I served with...

700
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,840
...who never got to enjoy the world without war.

701
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,510
It's a very unusual feeling.

702
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,050
It's a very unusual happening and it's a very unusual bonding.

703
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,790
We knew that we could depend on each other...

704
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,990
...and so, we were a close-knit group.

705
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,700
Just brave, so brave it was unbelievable.

706
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:08,300
And I don't know anybody that I admire more than Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

707
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,400
And they were very, very special.

708
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,370
I'm just one part of the big war, that's all.

709
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:16,780
One little part.

710
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,880
And I'm proud to be a part of it.

711
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,940
Sometimes it makes me cry.

712
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,150
The real men the real heroes are the fellows...

713
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,560
...that are still buried over there and those that came home to be buried.

714
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,420
It seemed like you thought that you could do...

715
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,030
...just about anything and after the war was over and you came back out.

716
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,070
Well, you lost a lot of that...

717
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,230
...or at least I did.

718
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,900
I lost all that confidence.

719
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,800
We was hoping to stay alive, that's all, you know.

720
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,910
Henry the Fifth was talking to his men.

721
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:57,420
He said, "From this day to the ending of the world...

722
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,480
"...we in it shall be remembered.

723
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,650
"We lucky few, we band of brothers.

724
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:11,930
"For he who today sheds his blood with me shall be my brother."

725
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,090
Do you remember...

726
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,270
...the letter that my granny wrote me?

727
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,840
You do? Do you remember how I ended it?

728
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:30,140
"I cherish the memories of a question...

729
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,180
"my grandson asked me the other day...

730
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,180
"...when he said:

731
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,150
"Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?"

732
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,460
Grandpa said, "No...

733
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,460
"...but I served in the company of heroes."
