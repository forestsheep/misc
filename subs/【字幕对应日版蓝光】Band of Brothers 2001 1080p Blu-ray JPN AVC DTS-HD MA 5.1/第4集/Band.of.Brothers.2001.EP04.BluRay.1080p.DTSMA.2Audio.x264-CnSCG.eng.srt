1
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,459
The Toccoa men, that's the ones that was there at the very beginning.

2
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,299
They are very close and...

3
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,239
...they accept people coming in like myself...

4
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,739
...as a replacement.

5
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,539
But you also had to prove yourself.

6
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,969
Most of them were, we know were qualified parachutists.

7
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,179
They had to be.

8
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,779
A lot of them were awfully green...

9
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,749
...and we knew that.

10
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,049
We just... We hoped we could keep them alive...

11
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,599
...or they could keep alive, a lot of them didn't.

12
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,059
But, well, all right, they eventually blend right in.

13
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,829
I think maybe they were trying to...

14
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,709
...impress the older guys people like me or Shifty.

15
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,839
I don't know why but I got right there to where...

16
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,249
...I didn't wanna be friendly with replacements coming in because...

17
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,789
...God, I didn't like seeing them get killed.

18
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,979
I just, it just tore me up.

19
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,119
We were in awe of them.

20
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,889
They were wearing infantry badges, you know the uniform.

21
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,089
They had a star on their jump wings.

22
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,329
They...

23
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,168
They were like heroes to us, you know?

24
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,999
That's how we looked at them.

25
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,069
And they were good. Furthermore, they were good.

26
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,369
We had good officers, for the most part...

27
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,079
...but we had excellent NCOs.

28
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,049
They looked... They looked after you.

29
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,539
Lieutenant, nice and easy. We've still got a shot.

30
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,249
Tough break, you're having a tough night.

31
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,437
People have tough nights.

32
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,317
I'm sorry, George.

33
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,757
It's all right.

34
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,259
Nice shot, sir.

35
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,449
Thank you, Bull.

36
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,750
Thank you, Lieutenant.

37
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,949
Finish me up.

38
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,959
Here we go.

39
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,358
Double seven.

40
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,398
You're embarrassing the Lieutenant here.

41
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,269
Have a drink.

42
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,768
Don't mind if I do, Sarge.

43
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,738
Better start winning money soon.

44
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,609
I think your buddies miss you.

45
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,868
Yeah, they do look kind of sad, don't they?

46
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,438
They're just serious fighting men, that's all.

47
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,878
Well, I think I'm gonna go introduce myself.

48
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,949
Careful what you say now.

49
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,079
Don't take much to set my guys off.

50
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,719
Yeah, and you got some wild-eyed killers right there.

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,659
It's a good thing we weren't gambling.

52
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,028
Boy, we would've gotten killed.

53
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:07,556
Wanna bet? What?

54
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,220
What?

55
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,059
You wanna bet?

56
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:12,118
No, I'm not much of a gambling man.

57
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,328
Hey, come on.

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,799
First one to hit the bull's-eye?

59
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,339
Yeah, one shot. One shot.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,569
Yeah? Make it two

61
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,699
Two packs.

62
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,438
All right, two packs, here we go. One shot, very good.

63
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,699
Hey, fellows.

64
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,478
What do you hear? What do you say?

65
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,749
Actually, that's Babe's seat, Private Heffron's.

66
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,908
Is that right?

67
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,749
I don't care if it's fucking Eisenhower's.

68
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,059
Who are you?

69
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,728
Private Miller, James Miller.

70
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,899
I'm in Sergeant Randleman's squad.

71
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,559
Us too, I'm Les Hashey.

72
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,868
Tony...

73
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,459
Garcia, I know who you are.

74
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,598
Old Gonorrhea don't miss nothing.

75
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,478
Lieutenant, are you gonna shoot lefty all night?

76
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,109
Hey, come on.

77
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,739
Just curious as he's right-handed.

78
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,509
George. What would I do without George Luz?

79
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,068
Bu...Bo...

80
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,148
Goodness gracious.

81
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,489
Two packs, gentlemen.

82
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,079
I know you got them, pay up.

83
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,888
So, Heffron tell you about Doris yet?

84
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,689
No.

85
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,588
No?

86
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,018
Well, then I'm gonna educate you.

87
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,698
We're about to get on a plane...

88
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,959
...for that first frog town we never jumped into.

89
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,468
All of a sudden, Heffron stops dead in his tracks.

90
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,878
Bing and a bang and a boom everybody banging into each other.

91
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,269
Heffron's just staring up at the plane's nose, because...

92
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,048
...on it is painted this beautiful pinup.

93
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,779
And written underneath: "Darling Doris".

94
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:37,978
Doris just happens to be the name of the skirt who just...

95
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,688
...that day, sent Babe one of them letters.

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,053
You know the...

97
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,337
What do you call them letters that the broads send?

98
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,000
Dear John letter.

99
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,960
That's it, a "Dear Babe" letter.

100
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,549
Well, anyway, lucky for Babe, Patton overruns our drop zone.

101
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,664
Mission cancelled. In other words...

102
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:59,590
...Babe don't have to risk getting inside old Doris again.

103
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,380
Hey, Bull, your squad listens up real good.

104
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,510
Yeah, they're being polite like whenever Bull opens his mouth.

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,420
What are you saying?

106
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,820
Bull's boys are humoring him?

107
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,160
Like whenever he gives out some of his folksy wisdom from back down on the farm.

108
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,530
Probably think he's a fucking hayseed.

109
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,990
They're right.

110
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,300
What are you laughing at?

111
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,510
You new boys, you pay attention to Sergeant Randleman.

112
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,380
Got that?

113
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,580
That's the smartest man in the company.

114
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,770
Where'd you get that?

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,060
It's a Presidential Distinguished Unit Citation.

116
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,610
For...

117
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,000
For what the Regiment did in Normandy.

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,550
That's right, for what the Regiment did.

119
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,380
You weren't there.

120
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,150
Hey, hey, ease up, Cobb?

121
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,890
It's a unit citation.

122
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,590
Shit, Cobb.

123
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,590
You didn't fight in Normandy neither.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,000
I got hit in the plane before I got a chance to jump.

125
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,670
Hey, you all, listen up.

126
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,200
I got us an announcement to make.

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,250
This here is Carwood Lipton.

128
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,410
He's already married, Smokey.

129
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,750
This here is Carwood Lipton:

130
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,420
The new Easy Company 1st Sergeant.

131
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,930
As befitting his position...

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
...he says he has to make an announcement.

133
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,560
Well, hate to break the mood here, boys, but...

134
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,430
...we're moving out again.

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
As you can see...

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,660
...this is called Operation Market-Garden.

137
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,730
In terms of airborne divisions involved...

138
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,860
...this one's even bigger than Normandy.

139
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,410
We're dropping deep into occupied Holland.

140
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,770
The Allied objective is to take this road here...

141
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,480
...between Eindhoven and Arnhem...

142
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,140
...so the two British armored divisions can move up it...

143
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,450
...toward Arnhem.

144
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,750
Our job is gonna be to liberate Eindhoven.

145
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,690
Stay there, wait for the tanks.

146
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,790
The entire European advance has been put on hold to allocate...

147
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,670
...resources for this operation.

148
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,600
It's Montgomery's personal plan...

149
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,070
...and we'll be under British command. - Yippee.

150
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,870
The good news is, if this works...

151
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,810
...these tanks will be over the Rhine and into Germany.

152
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,410
It could end the war and get us home by Christmas.

153
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,220
It'll be a daytime jump.

154
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,280
Intelligence doesn't expect much opposition.

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,330
They think the Krauts in Holland are mostly kids and old men.

156
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,450
And we should take them by surprise.

157
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,390
In any case, say goodbye to England.

158
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,860
I don't think they're gonna call this one off.

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,420
What are you doing?

160
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,320
Look at Cobb, man.

161
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,190
Watch and learn, kids.

162
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,860
You wanna live?

163
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,020
Jump ready to fight.

164
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,840
They let you out of the hospital like that, boy?

165
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,710
They didn't let me out, I busted out.

166
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,910
I didn't wanna get reassigned to some other unit.

167
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,710
Can you make the jump?

168
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,350
Sure I can, Lip, I just can't sit.

169
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,390
Welcome back, Popeye.

170
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,420
Thanks, Bull.

171
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,590
Popeye went AWOL just in time to jump.

172
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,060
What's he doing here?

173
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,930
Who, Sobel?

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,870
Well, he's the newly appointed regimental S4.

175
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,460
Supply officer?

176
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,770
Yeah, you got it.

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,430
He picked me up in Aldbourne...

178
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,030
...trying to find you guys.

179
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,130
He know you went AWOL?

180
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,110
He knows.

181
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,980
He just said I was lucky...

182
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,180
...I could sit out this jump if I wanted.

183
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,320
I said I didn't want to.

184
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,720
So he says, "Hop in."

185
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,590
"Hop in"?

186
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,820
Yeah, I know, I couldn't believe it either.

187
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,190
Maybe he's gonna court-martial me later?

188
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,920
Let's get you some gear.

189
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Hey, Mal.

190
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,000
Over there.

191
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Son of a bitch.

192
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,610
Malarkey.

193
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,490
Sergeant Malarkey.

194
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,720
Sir?

195
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,730
You thought you'd get away with it?

196
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,400
What do you mean, sir?

197
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,280
Sergeant, that motorcycle is United States Army property.

198
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,150
That may not mean anything to you...

199
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,010
...but it means something to me.

200
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,610
Where'd you find it?

201
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,320
That's him all right.

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,680
Who is he, Sarge?

203
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,050
He was our first CO.

204
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,120
What happened?

205
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,350
He got promoted.

206
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,330
Just tap my leg, Sergeant.

207
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,670
Lieutenant, you'll be in the doorway.

208
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,030
Yeah, I know, but...

209
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,770
Look, Sergeant, you'll be the man behind me.

210
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,840
When the green light comes on if you could just tap me, all right?

211
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,070
The green light will be next to you, sir.

212
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,670
Just do it, that's an order.

213
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,610
Come here, come here.

214
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,240
Sling it around, and when you land...

215
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,550
...your knee'll hit the butt.

216
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,210
The business end'll break your jaw.

217
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,220
Lose your reserve, you don't need it. We'll jump low.

218
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,850
Take your belly band and wrap it around you. Fine.

219
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,760
I'm sorry, Sarge.

220
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,880
Don't be sorry.

221
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,650
Grab your rifle, let's go.

222
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,050
Where'd you get that from, Hoobler?

223
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,630
I think I love Holland.

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,300
Where'd you get these?

225
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,990
That farmhouse over there.

226
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,630
Just sitting out in the open.

227
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,140
I don't know, maybe they were expecting us.

228
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,670
Boys?

229
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,020
Made it.

230
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,320
I wonder if they hit anything.

231
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,400
Goodbye air support.

232
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,930
There's some kind of holdup ahead.

233
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,100
We're going in through this field here.

234
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,780
Move out, let's go! Let's go, move it, move it!

235
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,700
You won't be able to shoot as straight with that thing on.

236
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,760
Okay, hold your fire.

237
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,950
Hey, kid.

238
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,950
Bull!

239
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,190
Bull, you seen Captain Winters?

240
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,920
No, why?

241
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,050
Keep your squad moving.

242
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,270
Where are all the Germans?

243
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,130
They could be anywhere.

244
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,610
Keep moving!

245
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,840
Keep moving!

246
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,940
Pardon me.

247
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,690
Come on, lady.

248
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,360
Dick, clock's ticking.

249
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,290
Yeah.

250
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,230
Thank you.

251
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,730
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,900
Very kind.

253
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,470
What's up, Welshy?

254
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,440
Snipers.

255
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,140
We've gotta get to these bridges.

256
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,230
Sergeant Talbert.

257
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,160
Let's move, we've got work to do.

258
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,890
What did they do?

259
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,670
They slept with the Germans.

260
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,530
They are lucky.

261
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,430
The men who collaborated are being shot.

262
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,180
Mr. Van Kooijk here is with the Dutch resistance.

263
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,110
We've been waiting and hoping for this day...

264
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,620
...for almost five years.

265
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,020
Says he can help us secure the bridges here.

266
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,560
Together we can push the remaining Germans...

267
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,720
...out of Eindhoven.

268
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,550
And that's just the beginning.

269
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,590
Any idea where they might be?

270
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,130
Well, we're still working on that right now.

271
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,000
Pius and his friends here are getting information as we speak.

272
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,770
His contacts, a couple of towns down...

273
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,600
...saw the British 2nd and Guards Armored pass half an hour ago.

274
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,610
They're kids.

275
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,270
These are reliable reports.

276
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,240
Anything we can do to help you, we will do.

277
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
Anything.

278
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,080
Right on time.

279
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,200
Captain.

280
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll be happy to show you the quickest route to the bridges.

281
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,350
I'd be happy to have your help.

282
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,020
Get scouts to the edge of town...

283
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,120
...in case we're here for the night.

284
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,340
Hey, Van Klinken.

285
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,970
Webster.

286
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,340
Sleeping outside is for suckers, guys.

287
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,220
Better be good, I was almost asleep.

288
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,720
Heraus, Hande hoch.

289
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,730
Mach schnell.

290
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,720
Niederlander. Niederlander.

291
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,060
Sprechen Sie English?

292
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,510
Ja.

293
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,730
A little bit.

294
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,300
What were you doing down there?

295
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,930
It's an air-raid shelter.

296
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,570
My family has been in there...

297
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,940
...ever since the first plane flew over.

298
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,950
We're Americans.

299
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,070
Paratroopers.

300
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,680
The Germans...

301
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,880
...are gone?

302
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,790
Think so.

303
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,550
You see any, you let us know.

304
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,790
Are you here to stay?

305
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,990
As long as we have to.

306
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,050
Yeah, they don't tell us very much.

307
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,700
Or feed us much.

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,760
Please wait here.

309
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,400
You see that?

310
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,800
I say screw Paris.

311
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,270
Hey, don't talk about screwing, all right?

312
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,740
They all speak English.

313
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,940
They all love us.

314
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,500
What a fantastic country.

315
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,670
Hey, take a look.

316
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,010
Here, take.

317
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,180
Danke.

318
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,050
Are these olives?

319
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
Thanks, danke.

320
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,720
Ja, komme wieder, es ist gut.

321
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,460
Zigaretten?

322
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
Ja.

323
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,500
He never tasted chocolate.

324
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,840
It's pretty good, isn't it?

325
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,380
Oh, man, you know what?

326
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,980
I hate this!

327
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,880
Here, Sarge, you can have this one.

328
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,850
Vincent van Gogh was born in Nuenen.

329
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,690
Yeah?

330
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,290
So what?

331
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,490
Sure teach a lot of useful stuff at Harvard.

332
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,970
Mellett.

333
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,100
Hey, get a load of General Patton.

334
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,570
What the hell's he doing?

335
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,410
Makes quite a target, don't he?

336
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,550
Lieutenant!

337
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,420
Sniper!

338
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,960
Charge!

339
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,230
Clear the track!

340
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,260
Move it!

341
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,030
Come on, come on!

342
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,620
Medic up front, medic up front!

343
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,590
What should we do?

344
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,150
Keep down, stay still.

345
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,130
Keep moving!

346
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
Get up! Keep moving!

347
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,180
Keep moving!

348
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,940
He's shooting stationary targets!

349
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,950
Move!

350
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,990
The farmhouse, deploy right.

351
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,600
Take the right side.

352
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,510
Right.

353
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,940
Go.

354
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,880
Go on.

355
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,250
Kraut!

356
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,020
Shit.

357
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,460
God damn it, move!

358
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,590
Go, come out, come out!

359
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,780
Away, away, away!

360
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,470
What's he saying?

361
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,340
He said:

362
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,510
"Away, away,"...

363
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,950
...which either means that the Germans have gone...

364
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,380
...or he wants us to go.

365
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,480
I don't know.

366
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,970
Go, go!

367
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,220
Ramirez!

368
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,360
Beat it!

369
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,440
All right, fellows, set them up.

370
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,410
Tiger.

371
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,750
Shit!

372
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,290
Heffron, on me.

373
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,360
Stay low.

374
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,370
You got a can opener, Babe?

375
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,430
Afraid I don't, Sarge.

376
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,180
We've got a Kraut tank...

377
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,850
...100 yards on the left.

378
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,420
I don't see him.

379
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,460
Put some shells through that building...

380
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,260
...you gonna see him real good.

381
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,300
I can't.

382
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,390
My orders are no unnecessary destruction of property.

383
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm telling you, he's right there.

384
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,360
And I believe you.

385
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,100
And if I can't see the bugger...

386
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,770
...I can't bloody well shoot him, can I?

387
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,570
Are you staying or going?

388
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,590
He's gonna see you real soon.

389
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,920
What the hell's he doing?

390
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,820
Forward, roll tank!

391
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,420
Fall back!

392
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,700
Pull back, pull back!

393
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,800
Take cover!

394
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,060
There's a ditch on the other side.

395
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,830
Follow me through.

396
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,800
Van Klinken!

397
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,510
Bull!

398
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,950
Go!

399
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,930
Rifle grenade!

400
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,730
Schmitz, MG-42.

401
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,540
Ten o'clock, nail them.

402
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,410
Fire!

403
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,660
You had to leave him.

404
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,900
He's still alive!

405
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,690
Who's hurt?

406
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,530
Van Klinken.

407
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,090
Other side of that hedge.

408
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,900
Oh, shit!

409
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,770
Okay, ready.

410
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,520
Fall back, fall back, fall back!

411
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,700
Pull back, Alley, pull back!

412
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,170
Go!

413
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,470
Pull back!

414
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,120
Take over.

415
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,020
Yeah, where?

416
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,920
We have to get him to the rear.

417
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,220
What are we gonna do, Lieutenant?

418
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,860
I'm not sure.

419
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,330
Sir, they're about to unflank us.

420
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
We gotta get out of here!

421
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,980
We have infantry everywhere.

422
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,540
Repeat, Arnhem has cut the road.

423
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,310
We are covered in infantry.

424
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,120
We are pulling back.

425
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,850
Luz, fall back!

426
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,120
Luz, fall back!

427
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,470
Hash, where's Randleman?

428
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't know, Sergeant.

429
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,170
Get out of here!

430
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,980
Miller!

431
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,560
Come on.

432
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,430
Hashey, let's go!

433
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,670
Get down!

434
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,920
Medic!

435
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,880
Go, get a medic, keep moving!

436
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,330
- Hey, doc. - Lieutenant.

437
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,560
It's gone right through.

438
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,160
Side to side, both cheeks.

439
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,030
Malarkey, get them out of here, go!

440
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,930
What?

441
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,900
Leave me here for the Germans.

442
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,530
You nuts? We'll carry you.

443
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,770
Are you kidding me?

444
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,680
I weigh more than both of you two guys combined.

445
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,140
Come on.

446
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,210
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,280
Help us!

448
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,750
Get back to the tank!

449
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Keep moving, keep low!

450
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,940
Let's go, let's go.

451
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,000
Over you go.

452
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,980
One bullet, four holes.

453
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,880
Yeah, it's almost a miracle.

454
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,650
Lip, I don't think we know where Bull is?

455
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,950
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

456
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,510
Keep moving, keep moving!

457
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,390
Move them out, let's go!

458
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,920
Hurry up, let's go!

459
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,520
How bad?

460
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,590
I don't know yet.

461
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,830
Nix!

462
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm all right, I'm all right.

463
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,200
- Am I all right? - Yeah

464
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,570
Yeah, you feel all right?

465
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,540
Yeah, quit looking at me like that.

466
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,210
Captain, we got four dead.

467
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,680
Eleven injured.

468
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,020
Okay, let's move them out.

469
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,220
And, sir, Randleman's missing, too.

470
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,420
Randleman?

471
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,550
Yes, sir.

472
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,590
Okay, let's go.

473
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,630
Where's the Bull?

474
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,070
Don't know.

475
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,430
I never fired a shot, the whole time.

476
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,930
Find anything out?

477
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,840
About what?

478
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,670
Anything.

479
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,370
What we're doing next.

480
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,080
No.

481
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,420
I did hear one thing.

482
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,050
Lieutenant Brewer's gonna make it.

483
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,850
What?

484
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,730
Lieutenant Brewer's gonna make it.

485
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,920
There's no way.

486
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,220
He's headed back to England.

487
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,030
They'll probably send him home.

488
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,870
How is that possible?

489
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,030
He did turn his head at the last second.

490
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,830
When Sergeant Randleman called out to him.

491
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,860
No.

492
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,660
Just pull...

493
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,600
Fuck.

494
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,200
Just pull it out.

495
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,050
Go, go!

496
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,620
Hoob.

497
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,390
Any news of the Bull yet?

498
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,230
If there ain't no body...

499
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,390
...then there ain't nobody fucking dead.

500
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,860
Understand me?

501
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,460
I'm gonna look for him.

502
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,130
Not by yourself you're not.

503
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,330
I'll go with you, let me get some ammo.

504
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,370
That's okay.

505
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,240
I'll go.

506
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,500
Me, too.

507
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,420
All right.

508
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,420
Go get him.

509
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,760
All right, what the hell...

510
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,760
I ain't going back up there.

511
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,720
Webster, us or them?

512
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,420
Not us.

513
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,180
Stupid. Stupid.

514
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,920
Stupid.

515
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,126
Go.

516
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,203
They're bombing Eindhoven.

517
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,460
Yeah.

518
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,900
Come on, Nix.

519
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,610
We'll dig in for the night.

520
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,450
Won't be waving so many orange flags at us tomorrow.

521
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,790
Where the fuck you been?

522
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,480
Glad to see you boys.

523
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,030
Not as glad as us.

524
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:46,230
Bet you thought we'd given up on you there, boss?

525
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,490
Shut up, Cobb.

526
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:48,690
What?

527
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,930
I think we should go back now.

528
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,300
Hey, Johnny, look.

529
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,540
Bull!

530
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,650
Hey, Johnny.

531
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,310
Get a little lost?

532
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,610
Something like that.

533
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,380
It's good to see you.

534
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,510
me too.

535
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,630
I don't know whether to slap you, kiss you, or salute you.

536
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,690
I told these scallywags you was okay.

537
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,920
And they didn't listen?

538
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,050
These salty bastards...

539
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,460
...wanted to do a suicide run...

540
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,970
...to drag your ass back.

541
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,090
Is that right?

542
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,100
Yeah, I told them, "Don't bother."

543
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,440
I never did like this company none.

544
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,600
Hoobler.

545
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,020
So, they found you.

546
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,640
Wait, what did you say?

547
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:38,320
Johnny, don't irrigate me!

548
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,320
"They found you"?

549
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,720
I don't know who's more stupid, you or the hick.

550
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:42,920
All right, mount up!

551
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,480
Hup hup, let's move out!

552
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,490
Grab your gear, let's go!

553
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,360
2nd Platoon, grab your gear!

554
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,360
Let's go!

555
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,360
1st Platoon!

556
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,160
Let's start falling in now.

557
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,070
Cobb, move it.

558
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,500
Dukeman, round them up.

559
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,135
1st Platoon.

560
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:58,680
Grab your gear, let's go!

561
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,730
Van Kooijk says the Germans are concentrating...

562
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,660
...their armor up near Veghel.

563
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,360
We may be heading into some more tanks.

564
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,870
Well, as long as it's only old men and kids.

565
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,940
Yeah.

566
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,510
I don't like retreating.

567
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,650
First time for everything.

568
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,390
How are the other divisions faring up north?

569
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:51,230
I think we're gonna have to find another way into Germany.
