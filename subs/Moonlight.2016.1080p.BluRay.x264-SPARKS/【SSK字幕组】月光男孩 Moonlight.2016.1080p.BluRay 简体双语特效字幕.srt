你一路走过来的吗

322
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,310
首先 重中之重 你不能坐在这个位置
First things first. You can't sit at my table like that.

323
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,310
你不能背对着门坐 起来
You can't sit with your back to the door, come on.

324
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,620
如果有人悄悄靠近你 你会浑然不知
Ain't gonna know if somebody creepin' up on you.

325
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,290
好了 看到了吗

想什么呢
What's over there?

328
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,420
我昨晚看见你妈妈了
I saw your mama last night.

329
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
我讨厌她
I hate her.

330
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,360

332
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,430
我也不喜欢我妈妈
I hated my mom, too.

333
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,870

是一个侮辱同性恋的词
...A word used to make gay people feel bad.

339
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,860
-我是基佬吗 -不
- Am I a faggot? - No.

340
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,200
不是
No.

341
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,100
你可以是同性恋 但你不能让别人叫你基佬
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.

342
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,670
我是说 除非
I mean, unless...

343
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,180

你现在还不会知道 好吗
You ain't gotta know right now, all right?

349
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,010
现在还不会
Not yet.

350

你贩毒吗
Do you sell drugs?

351
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,370
嗯
Yeah.

352
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,570

好 脱氧核糖核酸
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

356
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,130
很长的一个词 对不对
Long word, right?

357
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,700

我知道你们还不知道这是什么意思
I know y'all don't know what that means

359
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,710
但是请先认真听

这么夸我有意思么
Why she got to compliment a nigga for?

那个特瑞莎跟你一点关系都没有

特瑞莎难道没给你点钱吗
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

491
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,230
她怎么可能没给你揣点钱

所以现在你可以知道白血球减少
So you can see how a lack of white blood cells

507
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,880
对人体很危险 对不对

00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,820
好 有人能解释一下 如果没有足够的白血球
Okay, can anybody explain what will happen to the body

509
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,020
人体会有什么反应吗
if there's not enough white blood cells?

510
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,230
如果没人回答问题
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom

511
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,890

我想做很多讲不通的事
I wanna do a lot of things that don't make sense.

put me straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.

942
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,400
在那里我遇到一个人
Met this dude in there.

943
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,030
我出来以后 他让我上街卖毒品
When I come out, he put me on the block.

944
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:53,200
后来我混得风生水起
Did good at it and rose up.

945
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,710
就是这样
It is what it is.

946
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,980
胡说
Bullshit, man.

947
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,910
不应如此
That ain't what it is.

948
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,950
那不是你 奇伦
That ain't you, chiron.

949
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:10,820
你又不了解我
Nigga, you don't know me.

950
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,860
我不了解你吗
I don't know you?

951
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,340
这是您的小票
There you are.

952
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,680
二十四点五美元
$24.50.

953
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,010
你为什么要戴金牙
Why you got them damn fronts, man?

954
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,400
为什么给我打电话
Why'd you call me?

955
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,730
什么
What?

956
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,870
我问你为什么打电话给我
Why did you call me?

957
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,010
我告诉过你的
I told you, man...

958
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,880
-有个男人走进来 -说重点
...dude came in... - Yeah, yeah, yeah...

959
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,790
他放了首歌
He played this song, man...

960
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,220
这是你的车吗
This you?

961
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,700
你说贩毒还真不是开玩笑说说的啊
You wasn't playin' 'bout them traps, huh.

962
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,110
开始飙车了吗
Ride dirty, huh?

963
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,720
差不多吧
Something like that.

964
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,090
你怎么上下班
So how you be in to work?

965
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,530
坐公交

966
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,230
黑车
Jitney.

967
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,570
有时当我带着小凯文的时候
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there

968
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,530
萨曼塔会来接我
when I got li'l kev.

969
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,310
在迈阿密没车的日子简直无法想象
I can't picture bein' in Miami with no car.

970
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:34,680
-这倒是真的 -我想也是
- Man, it's real out here. - Yeah, I bet.

971
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:39,880
这里天气又热 车又慢 还特别堵
Real hot, real slow, and real busted.

972
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,350
感觉自己像个窝囊废
Shot me like a duck out here, man.

973
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:45,020
你说什么
This nigga said "A duck."

974

01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,000
总不能让你坐黑车吧
Can't have yo ass on no jitney.

01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,410

那你今晚在哪里过夜
So where you got' stay tonight, man?

01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,370
是你倒的酒
Nah, you was pouring that mug. You was pouring it.

有太久没见你了
I ain't seen you in a minute and...

1013
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,310
你与我想象中不太一样
...it's not what I expected.

1014
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:09,420
那你想象的是怎样的我
Well what did you expect?

1015
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,530
你还记得
You remember...

1016
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,830
上一次我见到你的时候吗
You remember the last time I saw you?

1017
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,670
太久了 我尽量不去想
For a long time, tried not to remember.

1018
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,380
试着忘掉过去的种种
Tried to forget all those times.

1019
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,850
好吧
Yeah.

1020
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,420
我来到亚特兰大
When we got to Atlanta...

1021
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,490
开始了新的生活
...I started over.

1022
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,030
白手起家
Built myself from the ground up.

1023
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,690
变得强大起来
Built myself hard.

1024
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,900
-你怎么样 -我吗
- What about you? You-- - me?

1025
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,810
我根本不值一提
I wasn't never really worth shit.

1026
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,750
只是浑浑噩噩地活着
Just kept on, man.

1027
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,490
从未实现过心中所想
Never really did anything I actually wanted to do.

1028
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,440
我能做的
It was all I could do was

1029
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,990
就是活成别人所想的样子
to do what folks thought I should be doing.

1030
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,890
我从来没真正做自己
I wasn't never really myself.

1031
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,270
现在呢
And now?

1032
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,730
现在
Now?

1033
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,810
如今
Now, man...

1034
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,240
我有了小凯文
...now I got li'l kev.

1035
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,040
做着这份工作
Got this job.

1036
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,950
十八个月的实习期
Another 18 months of probation.

1037
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,920
真实无比
That 's some real shit, man.

1038
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,590
这就是我的人生
Nah, man. It's a life.

1039
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,650
你知道吗
You know?

1040
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,920
我从来没经历过这样的生活
I ain't never had that before.

1041
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:57,460
现在的我
Like...

1042
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,260
疲于奔命
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,

1043
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:03,260
挣着这点小钱
and I ain't making more than shoe money, but...

1044
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:07,130
但是我已经不再烦恼了
...I ain't got no worries, man.

1045
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:09,470
我是说以前的种种烦恼
Not them kind what I had before.

1046
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:12,340
这是真实的生活
That's that real shit.

1047
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,940
就像鲍勃・马利说过的那样
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

1048
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,200
这一生只有你抚摸过我
You the only man that's ever touched me.

1049
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,840
只有你一个
You're the only one.

1050
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,750
从那以后我也没再碰过别人
I haven't really touched anyone, since.

1051
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,580
