首先 重中之重 你不能坐在這個位置
First things first. You can't sit at my table like that.

323
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,310
你不能背對著門坐 起來
You can't sit with your back to the door, come on.

324
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,620
如果有人悄悄靠近你 你會渾然不知
Ain't gonna know if somebody creepin' up on you.

325

我昨晚看見你媽媽了

329
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
我討厭她

你可以是同性戀 但你不能讓別人叫你基佬
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.

342
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,670

00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,710
那個特瑞莎跟你一點關係都沒有
That bitch over there ain't no kin of you.

483
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,240

490
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,890
特瑞莎難道沒給你點錢嗎
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

491
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,230
她怎麼可能沒給你揣點錢
Your li'l play-play mama ain't put something in your hand?

492
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,530
把錢給我
Give me that damn money, chiron.

這就對了
Yes. That is what I thought.

501
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,760
我對她還真是瞭解
I know that bitch like a hooker know her trick.

502
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,360
你是我的孩子 好嗎
You my child, okay?

503
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,460
告訴她最好不要忘了
And tell that bitch she better not forget it.

504
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,230
接著去上學
Go on to school.

00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,460
你沒遲到嗎
Ain't you late?

506

所以現在你可以知道白血球減少
So you can see how a lack of white blood cells

507
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,880
對人體很危險 對不對
can be dangerous to the human body, right?

508
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,820
好 有人能解釋一下 如果沒有足夠的白血球
Okay, can anybody explain what will happen to the body

509
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,020
人體會有什麼反應嗎
if there's not enough white blood cells?

510
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,230
如果沒人回答問題
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom

511
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,890
就不下課
until I get a response.

512
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,430

520
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,690
是哦 她長得可真是漂亮呢

Or does she charge like Paula?

524
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,660
寶拉現在便宜了
Hell, Paula getting cheap though.

525
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,230

一切都變得安靜 你知道嗎
Everything just gets quiet, you know?

577
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,180

感覺自己都快變成水做的了
I feel like I'm gon' just turn into drops.

595
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,280
我想做很多講不通的事
I wanna do a lot of things that don't make sense.

596
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,850
我沒有說講不通啊

01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,080
說吧 直接說
Yeah, nigga, straight up.

937
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,450
我在販毒
I'm trappin'.

938
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,590
什麼
What?

939
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,650
嗯
Yeah.

940
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,460
因為打了那個男孩
When they sent me to Atlanta,

941
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:45,530
他們送我到亞特蘭大的少管所
put me straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.

942
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,400
在那裏我遇到一個人
Met this dude in there.

943
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,030
我出來以後 他讓我上街賣毒品
When I come out, he put me on the block.

944
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:53,200
後來我混得風生水起
Did good at it and rose up.

945
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,710
就是這樣
It is what it is.

946
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,980
胡說
Bullshit, man.

947
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,910
不應如此
That ain't what it is.

948
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,950
那不是你 奇倫
That ain't you, chiron.

949
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:10,820
你又不瞭解我
Nigga, you don't know me.

950
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,860
我不瞭解你嗎
I don't know you?

951
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,340
這是您的小票
There you are.

952
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,680
二十四點五美元
$24.50.

953
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,010
你為什麼要戴金牙
Why you got them damn fronts, man?

954
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,400
為什麼給我打電話
Why'd you call me?

955
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,730
什麼
What?

956
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,870
我問你為什麼打電話給我
Why did you call me?

957
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,010
我告訴過你的
I told you, man...

958
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,880
-有個男人走進來 -說重點
...dude came in... - Yeah, yeah, yeah...

959
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,790
他放了首歌
He played this song, man...

960
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,220
這是你的車嗎
This you?

961
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,700
你說販毒還真不是開玩笑說說的啊
You wasn't playin' 'bout them traps, huh.

962
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,110
開始飆車了嗎
Ride dirty, huh?

963
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,720
差不多吧
Something like that.

964
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,090
你怎麼上下班
So how you be in to work?

965
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,530
坐公交

黑車
Jitney.

967
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,570
有時當我帶著小凱文的時候
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there

968
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,530
薩曼塔會來接我
when I got li'l kev.

969
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,310
在邁阿密沒車的日子簡直無法想像
I can't picture bein' in Miami with no car.

970
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:34,680
-這倒是真的 -我想也是
- Man, it's real out here. - Yeah, I bet.

971
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:39,880
這裏天氣又熱 車又慢 還特別堵
Real hot, real slow, and real busted.

972
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,350
感覺自己像個窩囊廢
Shot me like a duck out here, man.

973
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:45,020
你說什麼
This nigga said "A duck."

974

不用客氣

01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,000
總不能讓你坐黑車吧
Can't have yo ass on no jitney.

980
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,410
奇倫

還是說你嗑嗨了
Like you was just- you was just on one...

985
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,570
就開上高速路嗎
...and you hit the highway?

986
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,600
是的
Yeah.

987
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:46,810
那你今晚在哪裏過夜
So where you got' stay tonight, man?

988
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,940

Man, you a lightweight.

995
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,370
是你倒的酒
Nah, you was pouring that mug. You was pouring it.

996
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:47,700
-我嘗不出味道 -別說了

有太久沒見你了
I ain't seen you in a minute and...

1013
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,310
你與我想像中不太一樣
...it's not what I expected.

1014
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:09,420
那你想像的是怎樣的我
Well what did you expect?

1015
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,530
你還記得
You remember...

1016
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,830
上一次我見到你的時候嗎
You remember the last time I saw you?

1017
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,670
太久了 我盡量不去想
For a long time, tried not to remember.

1018
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,380
試著忘掉過去的種種
Tried to forget all those times.

1019
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,850
好吧
Yeah.

1020
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,420
我來到亞特蘭大
When we got to Atlanta...

1021
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,490
開始了新的生活
...I started over.

1022
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,030
白手起家
Built myself from the ground up.

1023
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,690
變得強大起來
Built myself hard.

1024
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,900
-你怎麼樣 -我嗎
- What about you? You-- - me?

1025
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,810
我根本不值一提
I wasn't never really worth shit.

1026
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,750
只是渾渾噩噩地活著
Just kept on, man.

1027
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,490
從未實現過心中所想
Never really did anything I actually wanted to do.

1028
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,440
我能做的
It was all I could do was

1029
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,990
就是活成別人所想的樣子
to do what folks thought I should be doing.

1030
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,890
我從來沒真正做自己
I wasn't never really myself.

1031
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,270
現在呢
And now?

1032
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,730
現在
Now?

1033
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,810
如今
Now, man...

1034
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,240
我有了小凱文
...now I got li'l kev.

1035
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,040

Got this job.

01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,950
十八個月的實習期
Another 18 months of probation.

1037
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,920
真實無比
That 's some real shit, man.

1038
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,590
這就是我的人生
Nah, man. It's a life.

1039
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,650
你知道嗎
You know?

1040
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,920
我從來沒經歷過這樣的生活
I ain't never had that before.

1041
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:57,460
現在的我
Like...

1042
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,260
疲於奔命
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,

1043
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:03,260
掙著這點小錢
and I ain't making more than shoe money, but...

1044
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:07,130
但是我已經不再煩惱了
...I ain't got no worries, man.

1045
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:09,470
我是說以前的種種煩惱
Not them kind what I had before.

1046
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:12,340
這是真實的生活
That's that real shit.

1047
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,940
就像鮑勃·馬利說過的那樣
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

1048
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,200
這一生只有你撫摸過我
You the only man that's ever touched me.

1049
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,840
只有你一個
You're the only one.

1050
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,750
從那以後我也沒再碰過別人
I haven't really touched anyone, since.

1051
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,580
