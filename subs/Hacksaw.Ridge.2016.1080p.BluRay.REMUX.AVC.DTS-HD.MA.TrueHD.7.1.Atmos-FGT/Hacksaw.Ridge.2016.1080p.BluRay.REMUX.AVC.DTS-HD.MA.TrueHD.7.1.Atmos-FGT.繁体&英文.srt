就是少年人也要疲乏睏倦

你別鬧
You quit it.

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,820
天哪
For Pete's sake.

38
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,180
別站在懸崖邊上
Hey, get away from that ledge.

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,560
你們這兩個愚蠢的小鬼
You damn fool kids.

你們會摔斷脖子的
You gonna break your neck.

是道斯家的孩子
It's them. Doss kids.

42
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,610
和他們爸爸一樣瘋
Crazy as their old man.

43
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
他們新開了塊地 就在傑克遜大街拐角...
They dug up the corner of Jackson and Main...

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
鋪上了人行道...
Putting in the sidewalk...

45
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,830
你們現在肯定都認不出了
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

46
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,450
他們可能連你們也認不出了吧
Mind you, I doubt they'll recognize you.

47
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,680
我路過的時候 他們都不認識我了
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,470
就好像我和你們一起死了
It's like I died with you.

49
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,590
就好像我們從來就不曾存在過
It's like we boys never existed.

50
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,280
我今天就想說這麼多

戴斯蒙德 用你的右手擋住他
Block him with your right, Desmond.

52
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,210
住手
Stop it.

53
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,860
你們聽到了嗎
Do you hear me?

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
他們為什麼要打架
What are they fighting about?

55
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,670
他們打架還需要理由嗎
When did they ever need a reason?

56
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,800
湯姆 你就...
Hey, Tom, do you...

為什麼要管 省得我還得揍他們兩個

醒醒 能聽到我說話嗎
Wake up. Can you hear me?

64
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,860
你他媽的做了什麼
What the hell have you done?

65
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,040
他沒有意識了
He can't hear me.

66
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,670
讓我來
I got it.

67

哈爾

72
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,770

醒醒

上帝啊 救救他吧
Dear God help him.

77
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,350
哈爾
Hal...

78
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,000

What do you think you doing?

我現在要揍你了
I'm going to have to beat you now.

你知道規矩
You know the rules.

83
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,260
湯姆 住手
Tom. Stop.

84
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,150
不能這樣教孩子
What's that gonna teach the boy?

85
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,010
他已經夠暴力的了
He's violence enough already.

86
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,210
行吧 你就繼續寵著他吧
Okay, fine. You go smother him in kisses.

87
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,710
繼續告訴他 這世界是個美好善良的地方
You tell him the world is a soft and gentle place.

88
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,070
哈爾會沒事的
Hal's gonna be okay.

89

殺戮是最大的罪惡
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

93
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,330
而奪走另一個人的生命
And to take another man's life,

94
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,180
在上帝眼中 是最嚴重的罪惡
that is the most egregious sin in Lord's eye.

95
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,180
這個最傷上帝的心
Nothing hurts His heart so much.

96
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,270
- 你聽不懂話嗎 - 湯姆 你...

- Do I have to tell you again? - I am telling you...

你最好自己滾 女人 否則我會給你點顏色看看
You move, woman, or I will wallop you good and hard!

99
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
到底怎麼回事
What the hell is going on?

100
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,160
- 你沒事吧 貝莎 - 你他媽管好自己吧
- You okay, Bertha?- You mind your own damned business!

101
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,180
回去睡覺吧 湯姆
Go sleep it off, Tom.

102
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,950
我討厭他
I hate him.

103
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,480
媽媽
Momma?

104
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,610

他不恨我們
Oh, he don't hate us.

106
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,800
他恨的是自己
He hates himself.

107
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,910
有時候
Sometimes.

108
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,730
今晚你父親... 這不是他本來的樣子
Your daddy tonight... that ain』t the real him.

109
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,810
我希望你們能像我一樣 認識戰前的他
I wish you knew him like I did, before the war.

110
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,650
我們唱得如何 戴斯蒙德
How do we sound, Desmond?

111
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,810
就像是天堂裏的天使 媽媽
Like a heavenly host angel, Mom.

112
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,340
你知道 說謊也是種罪
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,

113
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,870
特別是在這裏
especially in this place.

114
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,160
我從來沒說過 那是負責歌唱的天使
Well, I never said they were singing angels.

115
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,670
外面發生了什麼 戴斯蒙德
What's going on out there, Desmond?

118
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,710
把墊子拉出來
Just the tarp.

我去叫救護車
I'll phone an ambulance.

120
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320

主動脈破裂
That's a severed artery.

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,700
你之前獻過血嗎
You've ever given blood before, Mr....

162
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,050
道斯
Doss.

163
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,590
但我的朋友都叫我戴斯蒙德
But my friends call me Desmond.

164
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,460
沒有 女士 這是第一次獻血
No, ma'am. My first time.

165
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,750
我的夢想是當一名醫生 但...
I always dream about being a doctor but...

166
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,510
我沒怎麼上過學
I didn't get much school.

167
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,000
獻完了血 你可能會有點頭暈
You might be a little dizzy when we're done.

168
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,140
有人會來接你嗎
Is somebody picking you up?

169
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,830
不 女士 我打算走回去
No, ma'am. Walking back.

170
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
你住在哪裏呢
Where do you live?

171
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,490
希爾堡 女士
Fort Hill, ma'am.

172
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,990
那很遠啊
That's a ways.

173
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,380
不遠 也就五六英里吧
No. Just five or six miles,

174
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,450
如果我從樹林走回去
but I cut through the woods.

175
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,380
那就是七英里
It's seven that way!

176
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,670
你肯定很喜歡樹林吧
You must really like the woods.

177
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,470
是的 女士 當然
Yes, ma'am. Sure do.

178
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,990
好吧
Okay.

179
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,770
用力按住這裏
Put some pressure here.

180
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,030
你沒事吧
You okay?

181
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,210
沒事
Yeah.

182
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,870
你穿得這麼帥 要去哪裏啊
Where are you going looking all spruced and nice?

183
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,480
昨天遇見了一個人
Met someone yesterday.

184
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,930
一個在醫院的護士
A nurse over at the hospital.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,690
她叫多蘿西·舒特 我要娶她
Her name's Dorothy Schutte, and I'm gonna marry her.

186
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,430
天哪 她知道嗎
Goodness, does she know that?

187
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
還不知道 但她會知道的
Well, not yet. She's about to.

188
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,600
你和女人說過話嗎
You've ever even spoken to a woman?

189
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,840
我的意思是 除了家人以外的女人
I mean, one that's not family.

190
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
我和她說過話了
Spoke to her.

191
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,150
既然那樣 來和你哥哥抱一個
Well, in that case, come and give your brother a big hug.

192
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,670
- 來吧 - 不要用你的髒手碰我
- Come here. - Keep your greasy paws off me.

193
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,430
祝我好運 媽媽
Wish me luck, momma.

194
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,410
祝你好運
Good luck.

195
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
下一個
Next.

196
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
坐吧
Grab a seat.

197
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,870
您之前獻過血嗎
You've ever given blood before?

198
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,340
獻過 女士
Yes, ma'am. I have.

199
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,810
你是那個皮帶男孩
You're the belt man.

200
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,440
我叫戴斯蒙德 是的 女士
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

201
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,500
戴斯蒙德 你不能連著兩天來獻血
Well, Desmond, we can't take your blood two days in a row.

202
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,600
那好吧 我來是為了要回我的血
Well, that's good. I came to get mine back.

203
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,680
什麼
You what?

204
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,250
我的血 把它還給我
My blood, I need it back.

205
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
那樣可不行
Well, it don't work like that.

206
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,260
我們不能還給你
We can't just give it back to you.

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,790
你必須還給我
Well, you got to.

208
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,020
自從你用針頭紮了我之後
Ever since you stuck me with that needle,

209
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,840
我的心就跳得飛快
my heart has been beating real fast.

210
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,750
每次我想到你 就跳得更快了
Everytime I think about you, it beats faster still.

211
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,400
我從沒聽過這樣的搭訕
I never heard that one before.

212
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,700
陳腔濫調
It's pretty corny.

213
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,810
是嗎
It is?

214
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,810
沒錯
Yeah.

215
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,760
真可惜 我還練了整整一個晚上
That's a shame. I've done practicing that all night.

216
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,750
表現得不好嗎
No good?

217
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,840
我可沒那麼說
I didn't say that.

218
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,330
動脈和靜脈的區別是什麼
What's the difference between an artery and a vein?

219
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,850
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

220
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,580
那個男孩的事故
The boy's accident.

221
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,830
動脈的血是噴出來的
Arteries spurt blood.

222
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,350
靜脈呢
And veins?

223
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
流出來的
Bleed.

224
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,580
我覺得 你應該在出門前
I think you need to practice your

225
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,350
好好練習下 如何和女生聊天
boy-girl-dating-talk at home before you come out.

226
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
沒錯 我確實需要練習
Yeah, I probably do.

227
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,880
如果你感興趣 我可以給你一本書
I'll give you a book if you're that interested.

228
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,290
關於約會的嗎
On dating?

229
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,260
關於血液的
On blood.

230
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,960
還有什麼醫學問題嗎
Another medical question perhaps?

231
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,200
不 我覺得 你是我見過最漂亮的姑娘
No. I just think you're the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

232
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,580
因為我坐在暗處 你看不清楚
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

233
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,020
不
No.

234
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
你真是太美了
You're just beautiful.

235
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,230
別擋道
Out of the way!

236
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,100
你走路得看著前面
You need to watch where you're going.

237
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,210
抱歉 我以為你不介意
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd mind.

238
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,000
你又沒問
You didn't ask.

239
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
我以為你會接受
I thought you might've liked it.

240
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,720
你要是問了 我說不定會接受
Well, I might've if you'd asked.

241
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
你要來嗎
You coming?

242
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,120
走路看著點
Watch where you're walking!

243
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,190
為何你之前沒告訴我們
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

244
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,970
因為你們會盡力勸我不要去
'Cause you would've tried and talked me out of it.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
而我知道自己這樣做才是對的
I know what I'm doing is right.

246
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,590
那聖經上說的十誡呢
And what about His commandment?

247
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
在戰爭中 殺戮不是罪惡
It's not killing in a war.

248
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,390
我是在幫助我們教堂裏的小伙子們 以免他們參戰
I was protecting loads of boys from our church from going.

249
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,890
好吧
Yeah.

250
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
現在是戰時 國家需要兵源
There's a war and they need men.

251
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,470
在造紙廠工作 並不會拯救這個國家
And working in a paper mill ain't going to save this country.

252
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,760
你看起來像個電影明星
Looks like a movie star,

253
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,890
小伙子
our boy.

254
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,860
軍服很帥
Nice uniform.

255
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,410
帽子也不錯
Good hat.

256
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,820
讓我想起 我們出征法國時
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked

257
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,260
亞提·吉登斯穿著那套軍服的樣子
in his look in his uniform when we went to France.

258
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,370
還記得他嗎 貝莎
Remember him, Bertha?

259
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,950
別這樣 湯姆
Don't, Tom.

260
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
怎麼了
What?

261
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,600
我只是想說 亞提裝著軍服真是精神
I'm just saying how snappy Artie looked in his uniform.

262
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,000
你們這些姑娘貌似都這麼覺得
All you girls certainly seemed to think so.

263
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,560
當時 他身邊圍的全是姑娘 他可驕傲了
He had them flocking to him. He was most proud.

264
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,780
我只希望 如果哈爾中彈
I just hope that when our Hal get shot,

265
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,640
子彈會從他夾克的前面穿過
it's through the front of his jacket.

266
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,590
那種乾脆的射入傷 不會弄得太難看
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

267
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,430
當初亞提是從背後被擊中
Artie got hit in the back, It blew most of his

268
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,570
內臟和腸子全從前面炸了出來 掉得滿地都是
guts and intestines out his front, awful everywhere.

269
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,860
完全把他的制服毀了
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

270
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,280
幸好他當時已經死了
It was lucky he was dead

271
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,540
永遠不會知道 他的軍服有多難看
so he never knew how awful his uniform looked.

272
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,550
你給我滾出去
Get out of my sight.

273
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,450
你到底是誰呀 難道是山羊嗎
What are you? Part mountain goat?

274
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,530
你還要不要幫我一把啊 戴斯蒙德·道斯
Are you gonna help me, Desmond Doss?

275
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,120
還是就這麼丟下我 困在這裏
Or are you just gonna leave me stranded?

276
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,910
我來幫你
I'll help you.

277
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,500
但你要答應一個條件
But it's gonna cost you.

278
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,700
什麼條件
What?

279
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,400
一個吻
A kiss.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,560
這簡直就是赤裸裸的敲詐
That is pure blackmail.

281
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,860
是的 女士 沒錯
Well yes, ma'am it is,

282
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,800
不過我依然堅持我的要求
but that is still my condition.

283
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,540
那就說定了
That's the deal.

284
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,510
我會把你帶上去
And I'm going to hold you to it.

285
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,690
等等
Well, hold on now.

286
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,430
你不會再扇我耳光了吧
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

287
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,970
因為要是我跌下去 我會把你也拽下去的
'Cause I'll fall off, I'm gonna take you with me.

288
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,490
那就吻我試試看吧
Kiss me and find out.

289
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,350
怎麼了
What?

290
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,300
我必須去參軍了
I have to enlist.

291
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,710
我不能待在後方 讓他們為我拚命
I can't stay here while all them go fight for me.

292
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,570
你可以的
Yes, you can.

293
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,270
- 你可以待在這裏 - 多蘿西 我必須去
- You can stay here. - Dorothy, I have to.

294
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,690
我想去做醫護兵
I want to be a medic.

295
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,580
我覺得我可以去救人 而不是去殺人
I figure I'll be saving people, not killing them.

296
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,510
我得去上班了 我快要遲到了
I have to go to work. I'm going to be late.

297
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,960
多蘿西 親愛的
Dorothy, darling.

298
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,210
多蘿西 多蘿西
Dorothy. Dorothy.

299
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,370
所以你是要向我求婚 還是怎麼呢
So are you gonna ask me to marry you or what?

300
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,910
我不知道啊 你會答應我嗎
Well, I don't know. You're still going to have me?

301
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,190
我也不知道 你還沒問呢
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

302
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,320
那我這就求婚
Well, I'm asking you,

303
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,090
真心誠意
with all my heart and then some.

304
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,270
你願意嫁給我嗎
Will you marry me?

305
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,790
那我就答應吧
Then, yes.

306
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,480
我願意
Yes. I will.

307
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,880
什麼時候呢
When?

308
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,000
等到你第一次休假回家 我們就結婚
Soon as you get your first leave.

309
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
不過現在 我還是不喜歡你
But I still don't like you at this moment.

310
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,260
好吧
Yeah.

311
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,470
好吧
Okay.

312
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,980
我愛你
Okay. Well, I love you.

313
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,050
噓
Shhhh.

314
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,490
媽媽說 在這裏可以找到你
Momma said come see you here.

315
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,680
當初 他們三個是我最好的朋友
These three were my best friends.

316
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,620
我和他們一起長大
I grew up with 'em.

317
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,440
和他們一起闖禍 和他們一起追女孩
I got into trouble with 'em. Chased girls with 'em.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
然後也和他們一起入伍
And I enlisted with 'em.

319
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,350
現在 我的朋友們就在這裏
Now my friends are there,

320
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,560
被泥土和野草覆蓋 被蟲子吞噬
covered in dirt and grasss, and eaten by worms.

321
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,930
我不想也來這裏祭奠我的兒子們
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.

322
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,480
爸爸 我已經報名了
Daddy, I... I signed up already.

323
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,450
我別無選擇啊 老爹
I couldn't do otherwise, pop.

324
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,120
- 其他人都... - 你不是其他人
- Everybody else is doing...- You ain't everybody else!

325
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,360
其他人都不加思考
Everybody else jumps in and does thing quick,

326
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,020
魯莽行事
without thinking!

327
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,080
就像我們當初那樣 都是白癡
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

328
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,250
你要明白 那些能活下來的士兵
You know what? Soldiers who live,

329
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,600
是因為他們有能力活下來
they live cause they can do that!

330
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,630
而你不行
You can't!

331
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,540
你得冷靜下來
Look, you gotta sit

332
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,340
好好思考 好好祈禱
and think and pray about everything.

333
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
瞧瞧你 你現在就做得很好
I mean, look at you, you're doing it right now

334
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,840
如果你去了 你根本就活不下去
You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.

335
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,940
不 如果我不去 我才活不下去
No, I won't be able to live with myself if I don't.

336
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,290
我要去當醫護兵
I'm going to be a medic.

337
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,920
我要以這種方式服役
That's going to be my way to serve.

338
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,160
看來你都想明白了啊
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

339
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,990
怎麼著 你覺得這場戰爭會配合你嗎
What, you figure this war is going to fit in with you?

340
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,090
配合你的想法嗎
Your ideas?

341
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,870
我毫不懷疑 這肯定會非常艱難
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

342
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,880
不是艱難 而是根本就不可能
It won't be hard. It will be impossible.

343
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,710
你知道嗎
You know, whatever

344
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
不管你那瘋狂的腦子裏 現在有什麼想法
beliefs you have in your crazy head now,

345
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,520
戰爭都不會按你想的發展
they won't ever play out it.

346
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,080
戰爭從來都不是那樣的
It don't work that way.

347
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,160
如果真有奇跡出現
And if by some, I don't know,

348
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,900
你能活下來
miracle chance you survive,

349
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,450
你也應該感謝上帝
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

350
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,300
- 準備好了嗎 - 好了
- Ready? - Ready.

351
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,240
我們需要新鮮空氣
We all need some air.

352
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,530
來吧 夥計們 快點吧 為國效力吧
C'mon fellas, shake a leg. Uncle Sam's got you now.

353
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,810
跟媽媽說再見吧
Say goodbye to Momma.

354
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,630
快點啊
C'mon.

355
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,300
女士們 請遠離大巴
Ladies, please! Step away from the bus.

356
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,370
我差點忘了
I almost forgot.

357
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,450
我需要把撬棍 才能把你們分開嗎
Do I need a crowbar?

358
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,120
給你
Here.

359
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,650
我想要你帶上這個
I want you to have this.

360
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
這是我的
It's mine.

你隨身帶著它
You keep it right here,

362
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
就像我也在你身旁
where I'll be.

363
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,600
再見
Bye.

364
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
我愛你
I love you.

365
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,930
不許那樣說我女人
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

366
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,370
不好意思 兄弟
Hey. Sorry, pal.

367
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,040
這意味著 你就是那個傢伙
Means you're the person.

368
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,530
我這裏挨了一拳
I got a punch here.

369
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,430
不 只是被撞了下
Nah, it's just a bump.

370
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,620
難不成我每次走向自己的床位
Do I have to gaze at your deformity

371
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,110
還要盯著你那玩意看嗎
everytime I walk to my bed?

372
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,500
看吧 看吧 你就嫉妒吧 朋友
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

373
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,910
你還好嗎
You okay there?

374
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,330
你看起來是迷路了
You look lost.

375
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,990
這裏有個空床
Vacancy right here.

376

明智的選擇
Wise choice.

377

Call him 'Teach'.

381
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,350
他說的話 別人都聽不懂
No one understand a word he says.

382
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,450
那是因為這裏其他人都不讀書
That's because no one else here can read.

383
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,210
不過那對蛋蛋的主人
The testicles there belong to a man

384
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,710
自稱為"大明星"
calling himself 'Hollywood'.

那玩意看上去 像是屬於塊頭更小的傢伙

408
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,860
假裝自己是玩牌高手
pretending they're card shufflers.

409
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,990
格雷斯 安靜點 好嗎
Pipe down, Grease, alright?

410
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,390
別光說 有本事拿錢過來玩
Unless you want to put your money where your mouth is.

411
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,120
這是聖經 對嗎

只有無用之人 才會自稱長官

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,010
是你的頭髮嗎
Is it your hair?

436
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,770
還是你褲子上的褶皺呢
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

437
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,580
我的腳上插著把刀 中士

因為我腳上插著把刀

誰把刀插在那裏的 二等兵
Who placed the knife there, Private?

445
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,640
那只是場意外 中士 我們鬧著玩呢
It was an accident, Sergeant. I was playing stretch.

446
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,880
居然不是你自己有意插上去的
I'm heartened by the knowledge

447

464
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,490
- 你是束帶蛇嗎 - 不是 中士

你是在嘲笑我嗎
Are you grinning at me, boy,

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,250
還是說你平時就這樣

你的寶貝

別把你們的槍朝前

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,490
我可不想今天被射中

有問題嗎 玉米稈二等兵
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

586
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,600
你不喜歡這槍的尺寸
Is there not one in your size,

587
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,870
還是不喜歡這槍的顏色呢
or is it the color that is the issue?

588
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,990
沒有 中士
No, Sarge.

589
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,570
有人跟我說 我可以不用帶武器
I was... I was told I don't have to carry a weapon.

590
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,730
再說一次 上前一步 二等兵
Come again, step forward, Private.

591
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,280
我剛才肯定是聽錯了
I can't be hearing this right.

592
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,740
我很抱歉 中士
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

593
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,900
我不能碰槍
I can't touch a gun.

594
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,830
所以 到底出什麼問題了
What exactly is the problem?

595
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,840
沒什麼問題 只是個誤會 長官
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

596
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,230
我報名參軍時 已經和陸軍說過...
I... I told the Army when I joined up...

597
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,490
那不可能
That's not possible.

598
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,340
你知道為什麼不可能嗎 二等兵
Do you know why it's not possible, Private?

599
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,180
不知道 長官
No, sir.

600
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,690
因為美國陸軍是不會出錯的
'Cause the United States Army does not make mistakes.

601
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,430
所以 如果有問題
So if there's a problem,

602
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,020
那肯定就是你的問題
you must be that problem.

603
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,200
我本不該被編入步兵連
I was just never supposed to be sent to a rifle company.

604
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,480
他是個拒絕服兵役者 長官
He's a CO, sir.

605
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,590
你是個拒絕服兵役者
You're a conscientious objector,

606
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,740
- 那你還來參軍 - 你誤會了 長官
- and you joined the army? - Well no, sir.

607
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,180
我只是堅持反對暴力而已
I'm... I'm a conscientious cooperator.

608
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,170
你是在耍我嗎 道斯
Are you screwing with me, Doss?

609
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,130
我沒有 長官 我是自願參軍
No. No, sir. I volunteered.

610
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,480
不管是穿軍服 敬禮
I got no... no problem with wearing my uniform,

611
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,720
還是盡我的職責 我都沒問題
or saluting the flag and... and doing my duty.

612
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,050
只是 持槍殺人 是絕對不行的
It's just... just carrying a gun and taking a human life.

613
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,360
你不殺生 是這個意思嗎
You don't kill. That's all?

614
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,550
是的 長官 是這個意思
Yes, sir. That's all.

615
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,150
你知道戰場上 幹的就是殺人勾當嗎
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in a war.

616
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,240
我知道 長官
Yes, Sir.

617
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,650
殺戮就是戰爭的本質
I mean that is the essential nature of war.

618
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,550
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

619
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
好吧
Alright.

620
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,980
那你對美國陸軍還有什麼其他要求嗎
Do you have any other requirements of the United States army?

621
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,040
為了能讓您在這裏 和我們一起生活得舒心
Is there anything else that we can do to ensure

622
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,860
還有什麼我們能為您做的嗎
that you have a comfortable stay here with us?

623
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,560
他不想在週六執勤 長官
He doesn't wanna work on Saturday, sir.

624
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,970
週六是... 我信奉安息日會
Well, Saturday is... I'm a Seventh Day Adventist.

625
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,420
週六是安息日 所以
So... saturday is my sabbath, so...

626
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,170
我不能工作
I'm not allowed to work then.

627
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,620
在我看來 這完全不成問題
I don't think that poses a problem,

628
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,660
你覺得呢 中士
do you, Sergeant?

629
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,370
考慮到道斯二等兵是個虔誠的信徒
We should simply ask the enemy not to invade on the Sabbath,

630
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,240
我們應該通知敵人 讓他們別在週六發動進攻
'cause Private Doss here is a prayer.

631
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,990
好了 事情已經很清楚了
Alright. Now we got that clear.

632
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,310
現在 我來跟你說說我的要求吧
Now let me tell you my requirements.

633
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,490
不像你的要求那麼複雜
They're not as complicated as yours.

634
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,750
我的要求很簡單
They are very simple.

635
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,720
只要你還在這個軍營 只要你還是我的兵
As long as you're in this company under my command,

636
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,940
你就得遵守我的命令 完畢
you will obey my orders. Period.

637
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,030
如果在這裏 你都不能服從命令
If you can't do it here,

638
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,650
那麼在戰場上 我就更不能信任你
I can't trust you to do it in the battle.

639
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,980
我會用第八條例來處理你
I'm putting you in

640
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,940
以精神問題為理由 遣送你回去
for a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

641
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,050
解散
Dismissed.

642
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,910
各位
Gentlemen!

643
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,160
我想向你們介紹一下 戴斯蒙德·道斯二等兵
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

644
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,890
顯而易見
Apparently,

645
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,760
道斯二等兵反對暴力
Private Doss does not believe in violence.

646
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,800
他絕不會採取暴力行動
He does not practice violence.

647
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,190
甚至不會屈尊去碰武器
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

648
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,700
道斯二等兵
You see, Private Doss

649
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,490
是一位拒絕服兵役者
is a conscientious objector.

650
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,520
在此 我請求各位
So I plead with you,

651
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,710
在戰場上 就別指望他來救你們了
do not look to him to save you on the battlefield,

652
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,790
因為他肯定會
because he will undoubtedly

653
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,530
忙著和他的良心作鬥爭 根本沒時間理你們
be too busy wrestling with his conscience to assist.

654
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,190
中士 不是這樣的 中士
Sarge, that's not true, Sarge.

655
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,500
二等兵 別說話
Private, as you were.

656
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,990
我知道
Now, I realize

657
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,360
各位對這件事一定有所怨言
some of you might have strong feelings about this.

658
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,450
我們浴血奮戰
It is what we men fight for.

659
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,570
就是為了捍衛我們的權利
To defend our rights,

660
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,860
保護我們的女人和孩子
and to protect our women and children.

661
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,910
哪怕道斯二等兵的信仰
Even if Private Doss's belief

662
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,500
會對婦女兒童造成傷害
might cause women and children to die.

663
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,530
在此 我希望連隊的每一位
So I will expect everyone in this company

664
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,370
能夠給予道斯二等兵應得的尊敬
to give Private Doss the full measure of respect he is due

665
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,440
畢竟他在這裏也待不久了
for the short time he will be with us.

666
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,430
明白了嗎
Am I clear?

667
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,320
是 中士
Yes, sergeant.

668
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,070
你看什麼呢 小妹妹
What'cha got there, Dessie?

669
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,090
你知道那是什麼嗎
You know what that is?

670
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,710
這個版本有點小啊
It just seems kind of small.

671
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,920
這本小聖經正適合你這個小男生
It's half-the-Bible for half-the-man.

672
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,600
拜託 史密提 把他的聖經還他吧
For Pete's sake, Smitty give him back his Bible.

673
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,490
我可沒跟你說話
I don't remember speaking to you.

674
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,990
你為什麼不動手呢
So, how come you don't fight?

675
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,440
你是不屑跟我們動手嗎
You think you better than us?

676
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,130
不是
No.

677
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,300
那如果你被打了呢
Well, what if you're attacked?

678
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,260
例如 就像這樣
Say, like that.

679
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:45,760
聖經告訴你
The Bible says

680
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,190
把另一側臉也湊過來 不是嗎
to turn your other cheekbone, don't it?

681
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,770
各位 我覺得這不是宗教信仰問題
See, I don't think this is a question of religion, fellas.

682
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,800
我覺得這就是懦弱
I think this is cowardice,

683
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,660
顯而易見
plain and simple.

684
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,130
你還好嗎 道斯
You alright, Doss?

685
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,930
你就是孬種 對嗎
Are you chickenshit, that it?

686
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,930
來啊
Go on.

687
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
打我一拳
Take a poke.

688
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,400
告訴你 我讓你隨便打
Tell you what, I'm gonna give a free shot.

689
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,830
打這裏
Right there.

690
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
打我啊 道斯
Hit me, Doss.

691
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
來啊
Go on.

692
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,050
揍他
Let him have it!

693
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,940
上啊
Go ahead.

694
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,060
不出手嗎
No?

695
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,490
孬種
Chickenshit.

696
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,010
- 這是什麼 - 還給我
- What is this? - Give me that.

697
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,500
這姑娘真水靈
This is a fine looking broad.

698
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,290
真漂亮
Nice.

699
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,320
傳過來看看
Hey, pass it around.

700
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,760
只有真正的英雄才配得上
Now, this would be the kind of broad

701
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,180
這樣的美人
that deserves a real man.

702
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,740
把照片還給我
Give me that back.

703
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,680
求我
Please.

704
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,430
求你
Please.

705
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,090
"求你 史密提 把照片還給我"
"Please give it back, Smitty."

706
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,110
求你 史密提 把照片還給我
Please give it back, Smitty.

707
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,430
你有出現幻聽嗎 戴斯蒙德
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

708
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,610
沒有 長官
No, sir.

709
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,750
根據我的理解 上帝會跟你說話
But I understand that God talks to you.

710
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,810
對嗎
Is that right?

711
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,770
長官 我並不是個瘋子
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

712
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,640
那大家都認為你瘋了
Then how you feel... most people regard you,

713
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,520
你有什麼感受呢
a... a crazy person?

714
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,100
我知道我和大家不一樣 但...
I'm... I'm different. I know that. But...

715
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,570
我沒打算強迫自己裝得和大家一樣
I'm not gonna pretend to be something I'm not.

716
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
我就是我
I am what I am.

717
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,240
聽起來很孤獨啊
Sounds lonely.

718
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,330
你孤獨嗎
Are you lonely?

719
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,050
所以你沒有出現幻聽 是嗎
So, you don't hear voices?

720
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,090
沒有 長官
No, sir.

721
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,010
我向上帝祈禱
I pray to God

722
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,920
希望他能聽見
and I like to think He hears me,

723
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,890
但我並沒有和他聊天
but it ain't a conversation,

724
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,400
並非像我們正在假裝的這樣
like the one we're pretending to have right now.

725
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,610
假裝嗎 二等兵
Pretending, Private?

726
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,480
是的 長官 我知道你想...
Well, yes, sir. I know what you really wanna do is...

727
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,650
想用第八條例把我趕出軍隊
is give me a section 8, draw me out of the Army.

728
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,450
但我沒瘋
But... I'm not off...

729
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,680
我腦子沒問題
Up above.

730
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,050
我只是堅守我的信仰而已
I just simply believe what I believe.

731
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,160
我在盡量試圖理解你 好嗎
Well, I'm trying to understand, alright?

732
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,400
是上帝告訴你 不要拿槍的嗎
Was it...  Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?

733
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,840
上帝說 不要殺戮
God says not to kill.

734
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,130
那是十誡中最重要的一條
That's one of His most important commandments.

735
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,770
但大家都將其理解為 "不蓄意謀殺他人"
Most people take that to mean, "Don't commit murder."

736
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,260
戰爭 則是特殊情況
War is completely differen set of circumstances.

737
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,050
主說 "我賜給你們一條新的誡律
Jesus said "A new commandment I give unto you,

738
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,800
乃是叫你們彼此相愛
That you love one another,

739
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,160
如同我愛你一般"
just as I have loved you."

740
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,230
我們面對的可是惡魔撒旦本人
This is satan himself we're fighting.

741
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,940
作為一名虔誠的基督教徒 你應該能明白
Surely, as good Christian, you can see that.

742
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,010
我明白 長官 所以我才來參軍了
I can see that, sir, and that is why I joined up.

743
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,900
但很抱歉 我不會碰任何武器的
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

744
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,050
毫無疑問 他的信仰非常獨特
His religious view is certainly unique,

745
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,910
但並不合適採用條例第八章
but they do not constitute grounds

746
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,410
沒法把他趕出軍隊
for Section 8 discharge.

747
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,500
有他這樣的人
How am I supposed to

748
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,010
在我隊伍裏 我要如何才能維持秩序呢
maintain discipline with a man like that in my unit?

749
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,020
我不知道
I don't know.
在我隊伍裏 我要如何才能維持秩序呢
maintain discipline with a man like that in my unit?

750
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,930
我不知道
I don't know.

751
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,810
但他出於信仰而拒絕服兵役 是合法的
But he is a legitimate conscientious objector,

752
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,010
只要能完成所有訓練內容
and he must be allowed to work as combat medic,

753
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,250
他就能以醫護兵的身份 留在軍隊裏
provided he qualifies in all other areas in his training.

754
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,370
或許我們可以幫助他 改變其想法
Perhaps we could help make believe in his idea.

755
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,970
沒錯 你讓他只負責營房和廚房的雜事
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks in KP.

756
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,870
他只要跟你說起上帝 你就給他點顏色看看
If he throws God at you, you throw hell right at him.

757
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,320
我要他走
I want him gone.

758
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,130
道斯 你的床太亂了
Doss, your area is in disgrace.

759
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,880
簡直就像個豬窩
It's a pig stock.

760
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,700
- 有什麼好笑的嗎 雷克 - 沒有 中士
- Something funny, Ryker? - No, Sarge!

761
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,540
- 你腦子有毛病嗎 - 沒有 中士
- You got some shit on your mind? - No, Sarge!

762
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,800
你們沒有意識到的
What you men fail to recognize

763
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,670
團隊中最弱者的能力 才真正決定團隊的水平
is a unit is no better than its weakest member.

764
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,420
為了幫助你們學習這個道理
Now, to help you learn that lesson,

765
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,960
這個週末 所有人都不許外出
there will be no passes this weekend.

766
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,130
全都滾到廚房去幫忙
You will all be on KP.

767
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,200
現在 所有人全副武裝 二十英里的負重越野
Right now everybody on full gear for 20-mile hike.

768
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,430
快點
Let's go.

769
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
出發
Let's go.

770
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,180
保持清醒
Get your heads right.

771
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,050
不要自怨自艾
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

772
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,130
看到你們自怨自艾的樣子 我就覺得噁心
Makes me sick seeing you feel sorry for yourself.

773
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,450
你們根本就不知道什麼是累
You dogs don't know what tired is.

774
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,170
我不停下 你們都別想休息
We gonna keep going till I drop.

775
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,660
來吧 夥計們
Come on, guys.

776
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,500
別打了 別打了
Hey, knock it off. Knock it off!

777
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,450
我還要睡覺呢
Trying to sleep here.

778
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,510
別碰我 別碰我
Get off me. Get off me.

779
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,030
你他媽到底為什麼還賴著不走呢
Why the hell are you still here?

780
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,340
- 立正 - 稍息
- Ten-hut.- As you were.

781
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,350
道斯呢
Where's Doss?

782
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,100
這對任何人都沒有好處
This isn't good for anybody.

783
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,600
這確實不是我當初報名參軍的原因
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

784
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,790
這跟你參軍的原因沒關係
It's not about what you joined up for.

785
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,200
而是關乎這裏所有人的性命
It's about the lives of every men in here.

786
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,210
還有你的性命 小子
And yours, son.

787
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,600
是時候退出了
It's time you quit this.

788
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,190
穿好衣服 我送你出去
Finish getting dress and I'll walk you down.

789
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,470
沒事的 道斯
It's okay, Doss.

790
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,990
沒什麼好羞恥的
There's no shame in this.

791
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
走吧
Let's go.

792
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,490
我今天還要值班
I got an extra guard duty today,

793
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,440
早上還要去廚房幫忙 所以...
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

794
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,080
走不了
I can't.

795
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,530
好吧 道斯
Alright, Doss.

796
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,350
道斯二等兵
Private Doss,

797
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,410
你能認出打你的人嗎
can you identify the men that beat you?

798
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,390
不 中士
No, Sarge.

799
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,280
你是說 你不知道誰打了你嗎
Are you saying that you don't know who attacked you?

800
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,710
我沒說我被打了啊 中士
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

801
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,940
你到底在說什麼呢 道斯
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

802
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,120
你睡覺睡得遍體鱗傷的嗎
You bruised half your body sleeping?

803
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,330
我睡相確實很差
I... I sleep pretty hard.

804
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,730
好吧
Alright.

805
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,060
如果這個週末 你們打算要享受艷福
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,

806
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,390
- 要記得做安全措施噢  -下一個
- make sure you put on a hat. - Next!

807
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,720
我可不想看你們帶著一身騷味回來
I don't want anyone coming back pissing cream.

808
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,100
難道你不想享受享受嗎 中士
What, you don't want to none for your coffee, Sarge?

809
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,710
那現在就來一發吧 史密提
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

810
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,790
- 這是你的經驗之談嗎 中士 - 下一個
- You speaking from experience, Sarge? - Next.

811
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,020
你去問問你媽就知道了 胖球
You'd have to ask your mom about that, greaseball.

812
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,550
敬禮
Move!

813
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,850
稍息
At ease.

814
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,780
道斯二等兵
Private Doss,

815
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,710
恐怕我不能批准你外出
I'm afraid I can't authorize your pass.

816
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,990
只有通過所有基礎訓練項目 才能享有假期
This is a furlough for men who had pass the basic training.

817
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,650
恕我直言 長官 我已經通過了
Well, sir... respectfully, sir, I have.

818
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,160
我三周前就開始申請這次外出了
I... I put in for this furlough three weeks ago.

819
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,670
今天下午 我就要結婚了
I'm getting married this afternoon.

820
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,850
上面寫著 你沒有通過步槍測試
It says you're not rifle-qualified.

821
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,560
但我不需要佩槍 長官
Well, I'm not required to carry a rifle, sir.

822
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,820
上校... 施特爾策上校 他...
Colonel... Colonel Stelzer he...

823
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,460
施特爾策上校的規矩是說
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

824
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,520
"如果道斯想要留在軍隊 做醫護兵
"Doss must be allowed to work as a combat medic,

825
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,090
他必須通過所有的訓練測試"
provided he qualifies in all other areas of his training."

826
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,310
但你並沒有通過步槍訓練 二等兵
And you have not qualifiedon the rifle range, private.

827
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,120
非常清楚
Pretty clear.

828
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,940
讓我看看 你會不會拿槍
Show me you know how to handle a rifle,

829
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,930
如果你會 我就批准你外出
and I'll sign your furlough.

830
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,320
- 坎農下士 - 長官
- Corporal Cannon. - Sir.

831
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,930
把你的佩槍遞給道斯二等兵
Hand private Doss your firearm.

832
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,270
我不會碰槍的 長官
I won't touch a rifle, sir.

833
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,540
我沒有在詢問你的意見 二等兵
I'm not asking you, Private.

834
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,150
這是指揮官給你下達的直接指令
That is a direct order from a company commander.

835
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,830
看在上帝的份上 道斯
For God's sake, Doss,

836
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,440
別胡鬧了 退出吧
you stop this nonsense and quit.

837
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,560
如果你拒絕
Refuse,

838
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,100
那我就只能把你送上軍事法庭了
and I will have no recourse but to court martial you,

839
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,680
在整個戰爭期間
and you will spend

840
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,600
你都將只能待在軍事監獄裏
the duration of the war in a military prison.

841
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:06,980
我做不到 長官
I can't, sir.

842
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,140
你還想等多久 多蘿西
How much longer would you like to wait, Dorothy?

843
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,540
我想 我們已經等得夠久了
I think it's been long enough.

844
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,270
很抱歉
I'm so very sorry.

845
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,450
有時候男人就會臨陣退縮
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

846
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,860
有些男人可能會吧
Some men might.

847
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,600
但我的戴斯蒙德不會
Not my Desmond.

848
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,700
你可能認為 我就是個混蛋
You probably think I'm a really son of a bitch

849
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,930
只在乎規定 而不愛惜自己手下
who cares only about regulations and not his men.

850
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
我可以看一下嗎
May I?

851
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,730
我和其他人一樣 也對聖經深信不疑
I believe in this book as much as any men.

852
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,550
也和其他人一樣
And just like any man,

853
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,830
良心備受煎熬
I wrestled with my conscience,

854
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,720
但當這世上你所珍視的一切
but what do you do

855
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,650
都受到攻擊時 你該怎麼辦
when everything you value in this world is under attacked?

856
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,080
我不知道 長官
I don't know, sir.

857
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,540
我不能回答如此深刻的問題
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

858
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,500
但我也感覺到 我的價值觀正受到衝擊
but I also feel like my values are under attack,

859
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,520
我甚至都不知道為什麼
and I don't know why.

860
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,820
我可不在乎你那什麼鬼原則
I don't give a rat-ass

861
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,170
因為日本人也不會在乎
about your principles because the Japs don't.

862
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,180
如果敵人襲擊你
If one of them attacks you

863
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,320
和其他受傷的士兵 你該怎麼辦
and some wounded soldier, what are you gonna do?

864
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,490
用聖經打他嗎
Hit him with your Bible?

865
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,250
我願意為我的隊友 獻出生命
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

866
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,100
光靠犧牲自己的生命 並不能贏得戰爭
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

867
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:06,950
聽著
Look.

868
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,210
我來這裏
I'm only here because

869
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,520
是因為 我不想看到你被困在監獄裏
I don't wanna see you rotting in a prison cell.

870
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,070
認罪吧
Plead guilty,

871
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,780
在法庭上 請求他們的寬恕
throw yourself at the mercy of the court.

872
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,820
或許他們會讓你安然無恙地回家
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

873
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,100
讓那些勇敢的人 去贏得這場戰爭吧
Let the brave men out there go and win this war.

874
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,540
如果我說服不了你 或許她可以
If I can't convinceyou, maybe she can.

875
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,630
他們不讓我打電話給你
They wouldn't let me call you.

876
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,410
我就知道這不是你的錯
I knew it wasn't your making.

877
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,360
他們對你幹了什麼
What've they done to you?

878
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,320
沒事 我沒事
It's okay. I'm alright.

879
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,970
我只是跟牆打了幾個回合 然後輸了而已
I just went a couple of rounds with the wall and lost.

880
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,450
他們說你很可能被送進監獄 戴斯蒙德
They're saying you could go to prison, Desmond.

881
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,640
利文沃斯堡監獄
Leavenworth.

882
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,160
肯定還有其他辦法
There must be some other way.

883
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,150
我不知道還能怎麼辦
I don't know what that could be.

884
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,780
除了碰槍這件事
I've done everything they asked me

885
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,760
他們說的我全照做了
except this one thing,

886
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,970
就因為我不肯殺人
and I'm being treated like a criminal

887
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,240
他們就如同對待犯人般對待我
just 'cause I won't kill.

888
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,270
你盡力了
You tried.

889
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,560
沒人能否認這一點
Nobody can say you didn't.

890
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,760
但你在監獄裏 能救到誰呢
But who are you gonna save in prison?

891
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,800
估計誰也救不了吧
Probably nobody.

892
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,440
那你為什麼 就不能拿起那該死的槍
Then why can't you just pick up the stupid gun

893
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,590
隨便裝裝樣子呢
and wave it around.

894
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,400
你不需要用它 只要做出讓步就好了
You don't have to use it, just meet them halfway.

895
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,390
但我做不到
But I can't do that.

896
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,690
你可以的 你只是太驕傲了
Yes, you can. It's just pride.

897
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,630
驕傲又頑固
Pride and stuborness.

898
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
不要混淆你的意志和主的意志
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

899
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,350
我很驕傲嗎
Have I been prideful?

900
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,180
或許我確實很驕傲
Maybe I am prideful.

901
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,720
但如果不堅持我自己的信仰
But I don't know how I'm going to live with myself

902
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,030
我都不知道 該怎樣生活下去
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

903
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,690
更重要的是 該怎樣和你一起生活
much less how you could live with me.

904
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,560
我永遠不會成為 你眼中真正的男人
I'd never be the man that I want to be in your eyes.

905
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,080
我之所以愛你
I fell in love with you

906
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,370
因為你跟其他人不一樣
because you weren't like anyone else.

907
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,590
而你也不曾改變自己
and you didn't try to be.

908
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,610
永遠不要覺得 你會讓我失望
Do not think for one moment that you'll disappoint me.

909
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,950
無論怎樣
I will love you,

910
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,140
我都愛你
no matter what.

911
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,360
我不知道他要怎麼辦
I don't know what he's gonna do.

912
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,660
不管怎樣 他都會輸
He loses no matter what.

913
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,660
他們想要他認罪
They want him to plead guilty

914
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,940
但這樣他就會被開除軍籍...
but then he'll get dishonorable discharge...

915
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,350
或者拒不認罪 那他肯定會進監獄的
Otherwise he fights them, he for sure goes to prison.

916
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,590
不管怎樣 他都會被人們稱作懦夫
Either way, they'll call him a coward

917
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,430
我不知道他怎麼能那樣活下去
and I don't see how he can live with that.

918
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,930
謝謝 多蘿西
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

919
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,660
如果你有機會跟他說話
If you get to talk to him,

920
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,590
告訴他 我們愛他
tell him that we love him

921
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,880
我們為他禱告
and that  we're praying for him.

922
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,090
為你們倆祈禱
We're praying for both of you.

923
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
我會的
I will.

924
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,550
再見
Bye-bye.

925
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,890
你能不要煩我嗎
Will you leave me alone?

926
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,130
你能走開嗎
Will you just go?

927
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,170
湯姆 你已經瘋了 簡直不可理喻...
Tom, you're out of your mind, you're delirious...

928
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,860
我當然是瘋了
Of course I'm out of my mind.

929
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,390
不然呢 我已經瘋了
What do you think I am? I'm out of my mind.

930
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,680
你給我滾出這間房 蠢女人
Will you leave this room? Stupid woman!

931
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,320
天哪 把槍放下
God! Put it down!

932
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,020
死女人 離我遠點
Get away from me, woman.

933
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,110
明白了 先生
I got that, sir.

934
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,180
我有什麼能幫您嗎 先生
May I help you, sir?

935
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,150
我想跟斯格羅夫准將說幾句話
I wish to speak to Brigadier General Musgrove.

936
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,370
沒有預約 是不行的
Not without an appointment you can't.

937
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,810
那是不可能的
That would be quite impossible.

938
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,340
能請你轉告他
If you would kindly tell him

939
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,850
托馬斯·道斯下士想跟他說幾句話嗎
Corporal Thomas Doss would appreciate a brief word.

940
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,600
他在參加一個很重要的會議
He is in a very important meeting.

941
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,220
在法國貝洛森林戰役中 我曾與他並肩作戰
I fought with him in France at Belleau Wood.

942
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,880
當時 他是我的上尉
He was my Captain.

943
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,680
求你了 女士 我有很重要的事
Please ma'am. It's... It's most vital.

944
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,550
謝謝你 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

945
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,870
外面有位叫做托馬斯·道斯的人想要見您
There's a man out there, Thomas Doss, wants to see you.

946
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:57,750
道斯
Doss?

947
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,730
很快就能結束
Be over in a minute.

948
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,170
你很快就能安全回家了
You'll be home safe and sound,

949
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,300
就像什麼都沒發生過一樣
like nothing ever happened.

950
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
我愛你
I love you.

951
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,780
本次聽證會 被告為戴斯蒙德·道斯二等兵
This is a hearing into the matter of Private Desmond Doss.

952
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,390
其罪名為
The charge is disobeying

953
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,890
不服從指揮官的多項指令
a series of direct orders from his commanding officer.

954
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,530
被告方做何辯護
How says the defendant?

955
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,540
道斯二等兵 希望做無罪辯護
Private Doss wishes to enter a "not guilty" plea.

956
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,680
是嗎 二等兵 我本以為已經談妥了
Is that so, Private? I thought this was agreed.

957
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,360
你打算認罪 達成協議
You wanted to enter some sort of plea bargain.

958
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,530
- 是的 長官 但我改變主意了 - 就這樣嗎
- Yes, sir. But I changed my mind.- Just like that?

959
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,940
你想繼續在軍事法庭上辯護嗎
You wish to proceed to a court-martial.

960
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,070
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

961
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,660
那後果自負 二等兵
Well, on your head, then. Private.

962
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
請繼續
Proceed.

963
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:36,890
法官大人
Your honor,

964
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,710
道斯二等兵
Private Doss

965
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,450
到處炫耀他的道德觀
waves his morality at us,

966
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
就像炫耀榮譽勳章
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

967
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,990
通過違抗
He flaunts his contempt

968
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,110
直屬指揮官的一系列指令
by directly disobeying

969
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,390
來顯示自己的輕蔑之情
a series of direct orders from his commanding officer.

970
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,020
與此同時 我們國家最出色的年輕人們
When the very best of our young men

971
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,290
正在戰場上 不惜生命 抗擊...
are sacrificing their lives against...

972
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,660
- 你還好吧 - 還好
- You okay? - Yes.

973
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,130
- 還在審議嗎 - 是的
- Are they still deliberating? - Yes, sir.

974
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,350
好吧 你把這個拿進去
Okay, now you go take this in there.

975
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,640
不行 非軍事人員不得入內
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

976
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,680
那你要他們中一個拿進去吧
Well, then you get one of them to take it in.

977
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,080
他們不會幫忙的 他們都恨不能把他埋了
They ain't out to help. They're fixing to burying him.

978
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,610
軍事法庭只需詢問被告
There's only one question

979
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,250
一個簡單問題就可以了
that any military court need ask of the accused.

980
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,440
你要否認 自己曾違抗塞恩斯頓上校的直接命令嗎
Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

981
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,990
你否認嗎 二等兵
Well, do you, Private?

982
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,950
不 長官 我不否認
No, sir. I don't.

983
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,700
那你到底在爭論什麼
Why are you contesting it, then?

984
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,500
你既然拒絕觸碰武器 那到底為什麼
Why is it so important to you, given your refusal to even

985
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,950
要加入戰鬥分隊呢
touch a weapon to serve in a combat unit?

986
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,260
因為在日本人襲擊珍珠港後
Because when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor,

987
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,890
我也感同身受
I took it personal.

988
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,530
我認識的每個人 都熱血沸騰地想參軍
Everyone I knew was on fire to join up,

989
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,730
其中也包括我
including me.

990
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,680
在我的家鄉 有兩個人
There were two men in my hometown,

991
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,820
因為體檢不合格
declared 4-F unfit,

992
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,220
沒能入伍 而選擇了自殺
they killed themselves 'cause they couldn't serve.

993
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,140
之前 我在兵工廠工作
I had a job in a defense plant,

994
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,710
本來可以申請延期服役 但那是不對的
and I could've taken a deferment, but that ain't right.

995
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,190
當其他人都在戰場上 浴血奮戰時
It isn't right that other men should fight and die,

996
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,070
我卻在家高枕無憂 這樣是不對
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

997
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,440
我要報效祖國
I need to serve.

998
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,450
我有熱情也有能力 成為一名醫護兵
I got the energy and the passion to serve as a medic,

999
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,610
與其他人並肩戰鬥 同甘共苦
right in the middle with the other guys, no less danger,

1000
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,320
只是...
just...

1001
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,570
當其他人都在奪取生命時
while everybody else is taking life,

1002
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,070
我將會拯救生命
I'm going to be saving it.

1003
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,040
世界已經開始分崩離析
With the world so set on tearing itself apart,

1004
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,890
而有人想要盡力 維持一點點原樣
it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me

1005
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,270
在我看來 這似乎並不是壞事
to want to put a little bit of it back together.

1006
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,400
- 抱歉 先生 任何人禁止入內 - 不
- Sorry, sir, nobody is allowed to... - No,

1007
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,580
你不明白 我的兒子是被告
You don't understand. My son is the defendant.

1008
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,570
我明白 先生
I understand, sir.

1009
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,180
但任何人禁止入內
But nobody is allowed...

1010
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,840
我有重要的消息
I have information, that's important.

1011
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,630
先生 你不能...
Sir, you are not allowed...

1012
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,760
雖然你表達的精神值得讚賞
While the sentiments expressed are laudable,

1013
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,790
然而被控的罪行 卻是無可爭辯 所以...
the facts of the charge seem incontestable, so...

1014
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,130
外面發生什麼事了
What the hell is going on out there?

1015
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,010
- 先生 - 讓他進來吧
- Sir. - Let him go.

1016
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:13,910
那是一戰的制服
That's a Great War uniform.

1017
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,160
是的 長官
It is, sir.

1018
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,420
長官 我想讓您看看這個
Sir, I need to show you this.

1019
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,720
我沒有冒犯的意思 先生
With respect, sir,

1020
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,010
但您已經不再是軍人了
you are no longer a member of the military.

1021
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,390
您不能參加這次聽證會 我很抱歉
You're unable to attend this hearing. I'm sorry.

1022
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,110
現在軍隊真的是這樣了嗎 長官
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

1023
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,360
你為國家而戰
You fight for your country,

1024
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,320
失去了許多寶貴的東西
you lose so much that were dear to you,

1025
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,760
然後你卻一文不值嗎
and then you're done with?

1026
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,920
軍裝被遺忘 老兵被漠視
The uniform's forgotten. You have no voice?

1027
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,530
您參加了里昂戰役嗎
You were at Lyons?

1028
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,700
是的 長官 以及貝洛森林戰役
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

1029
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,410
兩次都被授予了勳章 我看到了 先生
Twice decorated. I see it, sir.

1030
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,840
我想您是這位二等兵的父親
I take it you're the Private's father.

1031
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,880
沒錯 長官 我是托馬斯·道斯
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

1032
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,470
那麼作為一名退役軍人
Then, as former military man,

1033
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,040
您應該知道這裏的法律
you know there are laws here.

1034
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,050
長官 我知道那些法律
Sir, I know the law.

1035
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,400
我也知道 法律會維護我兒子應該有的權利
and I know my son is protected by those laws.

1036
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,510
這些都是被憲法所保障的
They are framed in our constitution.

1037
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,580
我相信這些法律 他也一樣
And I believe in them, as he does.

1038
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,500
正是為了捍衛我們的法律 我才會去報名參軍
They are why I went and fought to protect them.

1039
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,490
至少當初我奔赴戰場時 我是這樣想的
At least that's what I thought I was doing

1040
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,810
因為 如果不是那樣
because if it wasn't for that

1041
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,870
那我就不知道我為何而戰 長官
then I have no idea what the hell I was doing there, sir.

1042
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,630
謝謝您 道斯下士
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

1043
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,550
把信交給我吧
Let me have the letter.

1044
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
您必須離開
You must go.

1045
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,570
"國會法案保護
"The defendant's rights as a

1046
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,650
被告所擁有 出於信仰拒絕服兵役的權利"
conscientious objector are protected by an Act of Congress."

1047
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,910
"並且不能強迫他放棄這些權利
"And he cannot be compelled to waive those rights.

1048
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,090
包括本案中
That includes in this case

1049
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,870
他擁有的違反軍令拒絕拿起武器的權利"
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

1050
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,020
簽名 斯格羅夫准將
Signed, Bridgadier General Musgrove,

1051
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,490
華盛頓特區 作戰指揮部
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

1052
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:58,780
上校
Colonel?

1053
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,470
我撤回指控 長官
I withdraw the charges, sir.

1054
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,450
那麼案件審理結束
Then this case is dismissed.

1055
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,800
道斯二等兵 你被允許 可以手無寸鐵
Private Doss, you are free to run into the hell fire of

1056
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,960
衝進硝煙瀰漫的戰場了
battle without a single weapon to protect yourself.

1057
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,990
你將重拾責任
You may resume your duties

1058
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,120
受訓成為一名醫護兵
and begin training as a combat medic.

1059
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,790
- 他在哪兒 - 走了
- Where is he? - Gone.

1060
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,520
他出來就直接離開了 我求過他留下來
Straight after. I begged him to stay.

1061
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,610
- 我告訴過他 你肯定想見他 - 我明白
- I told him you'd want to see him. - No, I understand.

1062
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,770
等你回家了 告訴他 我愛他
When you get home, you tell him I love him.

1063

你一定要回家 回我身邊

1065
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,100
# 山姆大叔微微笑 平靜似小孩 #
Uncle Sam is smiling. Peaceful as a child

1066
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,860
# 但千萬不要把他惹惱 #
But never get him rowdy.

1067
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,190
別唱了 大明星
Cut it out, Hollywood.

1068
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:36,810
閉嘴吧
Shut up.

1069
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,410
- 現在你想玩了嗎 - 拜託 別唱了

1072

用襪子堵上嘴 可以嗎
Put a sock in it, will you?

1073

等我們到了再高歌也不遲
Save the choir for when we get there.

1074
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,320
真是掃興
Killjoy is here.

1075
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,350
都讓開
Give 'em room.

1076
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,950
- 讓開 - 借過
- Clear! - Clear! Move aside.

1077
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,670
九十六步兵團
The 96th...

1078
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:43,320
就剩這麼點兒人了
Or what's left of them.

1079
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,350
我們就是要去輪換這些人
These are the guys we are replacing.

1080
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,570
- 看起來沒問題  - 安全

1081
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,880

01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,260
我是曼威爾中尉 來自九十六步兵團

1085
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,560
我們來接受您的指揮 長官

Over there.

1093
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,860
你就是道斯
You Doss?

1094
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,880
我是爾文·塞克特
Irv Schecter

1095
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,560
你 我還有佩奇
You, and me and Page here

1096
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,960
是這片區域僅剩的醫護兵了 所以...
are about the only medics weg ot left in this area. So...

1097
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,260
我想我們將要團結協作
I guess we're going to be working together.

1098
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,560
你們剛剛從前線下來嗎
You just come off the line?

1099
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,140
那裏怎麼樣
What's it like?

1100
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,070
我問 那裏怎麼樣
I said, what's it like?

1101
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,770
鋼鋸嶺嗎
Hacksaw?

1102
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,240
我們攀爬了六次
We climbed up six times.

1103
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,540
六次 都被他們擊退
Six times, they threw us off.

1104
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:44,040
上次進攻之後 九十六步兵團已經所剩無幾
Last time, there wasn't anything left of the 96th.

1105
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,990
他們是禽獸
They're animals.

1106
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,630
散發惡臭的禽獸
Stinking animals.

1107
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,250
日本人不在乎自己的死活
Nips don't care if they live or die.

1108
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,730
他們悍不畏死
They want to die.

1109
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,480
他們不斷地發起衝鋒
They keep coming at you.

1110
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,780
而且從不放棄
And they ain't never going to give up.

1111
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,220
從不
Never.

1112
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:05,910
來 夥計
Here. Hey, buddy.

1113
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,900
這些日本人專門瞄準傷員
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

1114
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,920
取下你所有的紅十字標記
Lose all your red cross markings.

1115
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,180
對於擊殺醫護兵 日軍有額外獎賞
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

1116
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,590
那塊白布太顯眼了
That white's a bull's-eye.

1117
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,740
我給你找了個新頭盔
Here, I got you a new helmet .

1118
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,550

One-size-fits-all.

1119
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,980
那就是我們的目標
That's our objective.

1120
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,170
鋼鋸嶺
Hacksaw Ridge.

1121
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,750
只要拿下它 也許我們就能拿下衝繩
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

1122
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:45,110
拿下衝繩 我們就拿下了整個日本
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

1123
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,530
稍事休息
Take a breather.

1124
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,210
我們的海軍弟兄們 會先替我們轟炸他們
Our pals in the Navy are gonna soften them up for us.

1125
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,080
沒人能從這種攻擊中活下來
Nobody can survive that shit.

1126
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,090
他們可以
Oh, but they can.

1127
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:40,870
中尉
Lieutenant.

1128
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,210
堡壘在這裏 這裏 還有這裏 對嗎
these bunkers here, here and here. Is that accurate?

1129
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,220
這裏有三個...
Yeah, there's three...

1130
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,520
沒錯 長官 也許比地圖上再往後點 但...
Yes, sir. Maybe they look further back, but it's all...

1131
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,710
在上面 情況完全不同
it's all different up there.

1132
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,190
發射完畢 上尉
All clear, Captain.

1133
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,830
大兵們
Gents.

1134
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,220
出發
Move out!

1135
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,030
這是血
It's blood.

1136
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,530
那還用說
No shit.

1137
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,110
我們不是在堪薩斯州了 小妹妹
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

1138
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,410
繼續爬
Keep climbing.

1139
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,900

明天就能掃平整個山嶺
We mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.

1281
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,010
現在 孩子們

都給自己找個舒服的安全窩

1285
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,980
我們都不知道外邊還有什麼

尤其是他
Particularly him.

1290
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,650
我不管你是要撒泡尿 還是蹲大號
I don't care if you need to take a piss or a dump.

1291
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,630
都不能獨自出去
It ain't safe to go out there alone.

1292
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,250
道斯 你他媽要去哪裏
Where the hell you going, Doss?

1293

機靈點 小心行事
Be smart, keep your ears down.

1296
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,430
好了 大家先找地方吧

斯坦福和墨菲
Stanford and Murphy.

1303
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,220
佩奇和昂格爾
Page and Unger.

1304
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,750
還有拉斯頓.

1305
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,350
"和平年代 黑髮人送白髮人"
"In peace sons bury their fathers."

1306
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,280
"戰爭到來 白髮人送黑髮人"
"In war fathers bury their sons."

1307
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,740
別說這些喪氣話了 行嗎
You wanna stop spouting that crap?

1308
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,860
沒有任何作用
It don't help none.

1309
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,230
是啊

1310
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,490
你說的沒錯

在這是沒用
Not here.

1312

讓我來吧
Give me that.

1313
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,900
喂
Hey!

1314
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,380
喂
Hey!

1315
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,080
這位腹部受傷
We got an abdominal wound.

1316

這兄弟需要輸點血
This lad is gonna need some plasma.

1317
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,480
- 沒問題 - 交給我們吧

1318
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,910
好的 你安全了
Okay. You're okay now.

1319
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,410
他們會照顧好你的
They got you.

1320
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,630
我們要不要找個地方 吃點東西
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1321
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,810
是個好主意
Sounds good to me.

1322
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,210
把鋼盔戴上吧
Put your helmet on.

1323
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,600
你不來點嗎
You ain't gonna eat that?

1324
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,580
我不吃肉
I don't eat meat.

1325
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
你吃吧
Help yourself.

1326
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:27,820
你當然不吃肉了
Of course you don't.

1327
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,780
她可真是漂亮
That's one heck of a dame.

1328
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:41,990
你真是配不上這個美人
You know you're fighting out of

1329
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,470
你知道這點 對嗎
your weight class with her,don't you?

1330
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:51,980
是的 我知道
Yes, I do.

1331
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,430
可別這麼跟她說
Don't tell her that.

1332
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,170
她要是和我這樣的人在一起 肯定會更幸福
She'd be much happier with a man like me anyway.

1333
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,900
沒錯 不過等她認清你就不會了
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1334
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,420
有時候 我確實挺混蛋的
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1335
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
只是有時候嗎
Sometimes?

1336
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,340
你說的沒錯 好吧
You're alright. Alright.

1337
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,430
這些日本人很狡猾
These Japs are sneaky.

1338
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,480
我來放第一班哨
I'll take first watch.

1339
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,100
你先休息會吧
And you get some shut-eye.

1340
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,780
肯定是場噩夢
Hell of a dream.

1341
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,880
我夢到 敵人用刺刀殺死了我
Dreamed I got myself skewered.

1342
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,220
而我卻毫無辦法
I couldn't do nothing.

1343
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,960
槍就在這裏
Rifle's just there.

1344
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,080
不會咬人的
It won't bite.

1345
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:03,710
不對 它會的
Yeah, it will.

1346
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,170
看看周圍死的人
Look around you.

1347
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,020
在經歷這一切之後
After what we've just been through,

1348
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,010
任何正常人 就會拚命想要武器
any sane man would be screaming for a weapon.

1349
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,840
我可沒說過 我是正常人
I never claimed to be sane.

1350
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,590
我爸爸是個酒鬼
My daddy is a drunk.

1351
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,350
多年以來 他一直想戒掉
He fought it for years,

1352
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,060
但始終沒能成功
but it kinda got a hold of him hard.

1353
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,340
所以脾氣很糟糕
Made him mean.

1354
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,440
至少你還知道自己父親是誰
Least you knew him.

1355
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,840
而我父親卻可能是十來個男人中的任意一個
Mine could've been any one of the ten guys

1356
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,650
而且他們誰都不配 所以...
and none of them would worth a damn, so...

1357
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,350
所以 是你媽媽把你養大的嗎
So, your momma raised you?

1358
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,200
我記得她
I knew her.

1359
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,620
但在我五歲時 她就把我送進了孤兒院
But she gave me to an orphanage when I was five.

1360
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,980
從此就再沒見過她
Never saw her again.

1361
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,840
我學會了麻利做事
I learned how to act quick.

1362
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,720
學會了迅速識人
Learned how to judge people quicker,

1363
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,450
但卻看錯你了 大錯特錯
and I got you very wrong.

1364
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:01,160
我爸經常揍我和我哥
My daddy used to beat me and my brother

1365
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,990
太陽上山的時候打 太陽下山的時候抽
just because the sun rose and then whip us because it set.

1366
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,120
這點我都能忍
I could take that...

"小子 你是在打單套結 不是做內衣"

你是說塞克特 那個醫護兵嗎

我一直以為 你只是個瘦弱的孩子
All I saw was a skinny kid.

1661
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,890
我根本不瞭解你的為人
I didn't know who you were.

1662

你對這個國家所做出的貢獻
You've done more than any other man

1663
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,800
超過了其他任何服役的軍人

我這輩子 從來沒有如此誤解過別人

他們很多人都不像你這樣 擁有虔誠的信仰
Most of these men don't believe the same way you do.

1669
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:53,390
但他們堅信
But they believe so much

1670
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,110
你對自己信仰的虔誠
in how much you believe.

1671
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,140
你在鋼鋸嶺上的所作所為
What you did on that Ridge

1672
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:01,630
簡直堪稱奇跡
is just nothing short of a miracle,

1673
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:03,560
他們也希望能享有這份奇跡
and they want a piece of it.

1674
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:09,000
如果你不去 他們是不會上去的
And they're not gonna go up there without you.

1675
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,370
上尉 你們為什麼還沒行動
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

1676
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,750
十分鐘前 你們就該發動攻擊了
You were supposed to begin that assault 10 minutes ago.

1677
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:25,180
我們還在等待 長官
We're waiting, sir.

1678
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,470
等什麼
Waiting for what?

1679
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:32,050
等待道斯二等兵 為我們祈禱完畢 長官
For Private Doss to finish praying for us, sir.

1680
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,700
道斯二等兵正在為你們祈禱
Private Doss is praying for you?

1681
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:35,760
他媽的誰是道斯二等兵
Who the hell is Private Doss?

1682
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,770
準備出發
Let's go to work.

1683
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,560
跪下
Down!

1684
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:55,810
跪下 跪在地上
Get down! Get down on the ground!

1685
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,560
立刻跪下
On the ground. Now!

1686
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:39,490
躺下 快躺下 我有嗎啡
Lay down! Lay down! Lay down! I got the morphine.

1687
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,720
快走 快走 快帶他離開這裏
Let's go! Let's go. Let's get this man outta here.

1688
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,740
快 快
Go! Go!

1689
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:49,410
我的《聖經》
My Bible...

1690
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:52,420
我的《聖經》 我的《聖經》
My Bible. My Bible...

1691
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:54,960
停 停 快停下
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1692
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:58,790
我的《聖經》 我的《聖經》
My Bible. My Bible.

1693
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,360
知道了
Okay.

1694
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,480
戴斯蒙德 你馬上就能回家了
You going home, Desmond.

1695
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:19,530
我們拿下了鋼鋸嶺
We've taken the Hacksaw.

1696
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:26,160
等等 等等 戴斯蒙德
Hold up! Hold up! Desmond.

1697
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:29,310
戴斯蒙德
Desmond.

1698
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,820
當時 我一直在祈禱
I was praying the whole time.

1699
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,790
我一直向主祈禱
I just kept praying,

1700
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:23,820
"主啊 求求你 讓我再救一個吧"
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1701
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,720
每當救下一個人之後
When I got this,

1702
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:29,440
我就繼續祈禱 "主啊 求你 讓我再救一個吧"
I said "Lord, please help me get one more".

1703
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:37,810
在我看來
I would say anyone is wrong

1704
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:40,090
試圖改變任何人的信仰 都是不明智的
to try to compromise somebody's conviction.

1705
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:43,210
不論是在軍隊 還是在其他地方
I don't care whether it's the army or what it is.

1706
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,530
只要你秉承自己的信仰
When you're on a conviction,

1707
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:47,490
那就絕不是玩笑
that is not a joke.

1708
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:50,900
而是真正的你
That's what you are.

1709
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:54,130
雖然我對他說了許多
Even though I said those things

1710
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:56,410
說他應該拿槍上戰場
to him in regard to carrying a rifle,

1711
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,730
如果他不拿槍
then... then he would never be my...

1712
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:02,650
我就絕不會和他一起並肩作戰
by my damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1713
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:05,600
但最終
But then, in the long run,

1714
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,170
我卻發現 他是最英勇的士兵之一
finding out that he was one of the bravest persons alive.

1715
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:12,280
而最後 還需要他來救我
And then to have him ended up

1716
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,330
這簡直太諷刺了
saving my life was the irony of the whole thing.

1717
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:21,230
鮮血從他的臉龐和眼睛上流下
Blood had ran down through to the fella's face and eyes.

1718
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:25,900
當時 他躺在那裏 呻吟著 不停地叫醫護兵
He was laying there just groaning and calling for a medic.

1719
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:31,450
我從水壺中倒了些水 拿了些紗布
I took the water from my canteen and got some bandages,

1720
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:33,890
幫他洗了臉
and I washed his face.

1721
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,510
當他眼裏的鮮血 被擦乾淨之後
And when I was washing his eyes,

1722
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,310
他睜開了眼睛
his eyes came up.

1723
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:42,500
他簡直高興壞了
Man, he just lit up.

1724
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:47,050
他說 "我還以為我瞎了"
He says "I thought I was blind."

1725
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,220
而當時他臉上的笑容
And if I hadn't got anything more out of the war

1726
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,310
對我而言
than that smile he gave me,

1727
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:56,580
就是最好的回報
I wouldn't have been well repaid.
