和他们爸爸一样疯

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
他们新开了块地 就在杰克逊大街拐角...
They dug up the corner of Jackson and Main...

Putting in the sidewalk...

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,830
你们现在肯定都认不出了
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

46
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,450
他们可能连你们也认不出了吧
Mind you, I doubt they'll recognize you.

47
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,680
我路过的时候 他们都不认识我了
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,470
就好像我和你们一起死了
It's like I died with you.

49
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,590
就好像我们从来就不曾存在过
It's like we boys never existed.

50

你们听到了吗
Do you hear me?

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
他们为什么要打架
What are they fighting about?

55
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,670
他们打架还需要理由吗
When did they ever need a reason?

56
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,800
汤姆 你就...

为什么要管 省得我还得揍他们两个

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,040
他没有意识了
He can't hear me.

他已经够暴力的了
He's violence enough already.

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,210
行吧 你就继续宠着他吧

继续告诉他 这世界是个美好善良的地方

杀戮是最大的罪恶
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

在上帝眼中 是最严重的罪恶

这个最伤上帝的心
Nothing hurts His heart so much.

今晚你父亲... 这不是他本来的样子

我希望你们能像我一样 认识战前的他

你知道 说谎也是种罪
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,

113
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,870

没有 女士 这是第一次献血

我的梦想是当一名医生 但...
I always dream about being a doctor but...

166
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,510
我没怎么上过学
I didn't get much school.

167
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,000
献完了血 你可能会有点头晕
You might be a little dizzy when we're done.

168
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,140
有人会来接你吗
Is somebody picking you up?

169
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,830
不 女士 我打算走回去
No, ma'am. Walking back.

你住在哪里呢
Where do you live?

希尔堡 女士
Fort Hill, ma'am.

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,990
那很远啊
That's a ways.

173
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,380
不远 也就五六英里吧
No. Just five or six miles,

174
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,450
如果我从树林走回去
but I cut through the woods.

175
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,380
那就是七英里
It's seven that way!

176
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,670
你肯定很喜欢树林吧
You must really like the woods.

177
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,470
是的 女士 当然
Yes, ma'am. Sure do.

178
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,990
好吧
Okay.

179
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,770
用力按住这里
Put some pressure here.

180
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,030
你没事吧
You okay?

181
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,210
没事
Yeah.

182
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,870
你穿得这么帅 要去哪里啊
Where are you going looking all spruced and nice?

183
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,480
昨天遇见了一个人
Met someone yesterday.

184
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,930
一个在医院的护士
A nurse over at the hospital.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,690
她叫多萝西·舒特 我要娶她
Her name's Dorothy Schutte, and I'm gonna marry her.

186
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,430
天哪 她知道吗
Goodness, does she know that?

187
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
还不知道 但她会知道的
Well, not yet. She's about to.

188
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,600
你和女人说过话吗
You've ever even spoken to a woman?

189
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,840
我的意思是 除了家人以外的女人
I mean, one that's not family.

190
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
我和她说过话了
Spoke to her.

191
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,150
既然那样 来和你哥哥抱一个
Well, in that case, come and give your brother a big hug.

192
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,670
- 来吧 - 不要用你的脏手碰我
- Come here. - Keep your greasy paws off me.

193
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,430
祝我好运 妈妈
Wish me luck, momma.

194

坐吧
Grab a seat.

197
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,870
您之前献过血吗
You've ever given blood before?

198
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,340
献过 女士
Yes, ma'am. I have.

199
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,810
你是那个皮带男孩
You're the belt man.

200
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,440
我叫戴斯蒙德 是的 女士
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

201
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,500
戴斯蒙德 你不能连着两天来献血
Well, Desmond, we can't take your blood two days in a row.

202
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,600
那好吧 我来是为了要回我的血
Well, that's good. I came to get mine back.

203
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,680
什么
You what?

204
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,250
我的血 把它还给我
My blood, I need it back.

205
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
那样可不行
Well, it don't work like that.

206
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,260
我们不能还给你
We can't just give it back to you.

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,790
你必须还给我
Well, you got to.

208
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,020
自从你用针头扎了我之后
Ever since you stuck me with that needle,

209
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,840
我的心就跳得飞快
my heart has been beating real fast.

210
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,750
每次我想到你 就跳得更快了
Everytime I think about you, it beats faster still.

211
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,400
我从没听过这样的搭讪
I never heard that one before.

212
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,700
陈腔滥调
It's pretty corny.

213
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,810
是吗
It is?

214
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,810
没错
Yeah.

215
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,760
真可惜 我还练了整整一个晚上
That's a shame. I've done practicing that all night.

216
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,750
表现得不好吗
No good?

217
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,840
我可没那么说
I didn't say that.

218
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,330
动脉和静脉的区别是什么
What's the difference between an artery and a vein?

219
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,850
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

220
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,580
那个男孩的事故
The boy's accident.

221
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,830
动脉的血是喷出来的
Arteries spurt blood.

222
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,350
静脉呢
And veins?

223
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
流出来的
Bleed.

224
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,580
我觉得 你应该在出门前
I think you need to practice your

225
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,350
好好练习下 如何和女生聊天
boy-girl-dating-talk at home before you come out.

226
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
没错 我确实需要练习
Yeah, I probably do.

227
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,880
如果你感兴趣 我可以给你一本书
I'll give you a book if you're that interested.

228
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,290
关于约会的吗
On dating?

229
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,260
关于血液的
On blood.

230
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,960
还有什么医学问题吗
Another medical question perhaps?

231
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,200
不 我觉得 你是我见过最漂亮的姑娘
No. I just think you're the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

232
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,580
因为我坐在暗处 你看不清楚
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

233
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,020
不
No.

234
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
你真是太美了
You're just beautiful.

235
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,230
别挡道
Out of the way!

236
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,100
你走路得看着前面
You need to watch where you're going.

237
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,210
抱歉 我以为你不介意
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd mind.

238
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,000
你又没问
You didn't ask.

239
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
我以为你会接受
I thought you might've liked it.

240
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,720
你要是问了 我说不定会接受
Well, I might've if you'd asked.

241
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
你要来吗
You coming?

242
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,120
走路看着点
Watch where you're walking!

243
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,190
为何你之前没告诉我们
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

244
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,970
因为你们会尽力劝我不要去
'Cause you would've tried and talked me out of it.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
而我知道自己这样做才是对的
I know what I'm doing is right.

246
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,590
那圣经上说的十诫呢
And what about His commandment?

247
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
在战争中 杀戮不是罪恶
It's not killing in a war.

248
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,390
我是在帮助我们教堂里的小伙子们 以免他们参战
I was protecting loads of boys from our church from going.

249
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,890
好吧
Yeah.

250
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
现在是战时 国家需要兵源
There's a war and they need men.

251
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,470
在造纸厂工作 并不会拯救这个国家
And working in a paper mill ain't going to save this country.

252
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,760
你看起来像个电影明星
Looks like a movie star,

253
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,890
小伙子
our boy.

254
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,860
军服很帅
Nice uniform.

255
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,410
帽子也不错
Good hat.

256
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,820
让我想起 我们出征法国时
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked

257
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,260
亚提·吉登斯穿着那套军服的样子
in his look in his uniform when we went to France.

258
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,370
还记得他吗 贝莎
Remember him, Bertha?

259
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,950
别这样 汤姆
Don't, Tom.

260
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
怎么了
What?

261
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,600
我只是想说 亚提装着军服真是精神
I'm just saying how snappy Artie looked in his uniform.

262
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,000
你们这些姑娘貌似都这么觉得
All you girls certainly seemed to think so.

263
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,560
当时 他身边围的全是姑娘 他可骄傲了
He had them flocking to him. He was most proud.

264
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,780
我只希望 如果哈尔中弹
I just hope that when our Hal get shot,

265
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,640
子弹会从他夹克的前面穿过
it's through the front of his jacket.

266
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,590
那种干脆的射入伤 不会弄得太难看
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

267
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,430
当初亚提是从背后被击中
Artie got hit in the back, It blew most of his

268
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,570
内脏和肠子全从前面炸了出来 掉得满地都是
guts and intestines out his front, awful everywhere.

269
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,860
完全把他的制服毁了
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

270
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,280
幸好他当时已经死了
It was lucky he was dead

271
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,540
永远不会知道 他的军服有多难看
so he never knew how awful his uniform looked.

272
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,550
你给我滚出去
Get out of my sight.

273
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,450
你到底是谁呀 难道是山羊吗
What are you? Part mountain goat?

274
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,530
你还要不要帮我一把啊 戴斯蒙德·道斯
Are you gonna help me, Desmond Doss?

275
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,120
还是就这么丢下我 困在这里
Or are you just gonna leave me stranded?

276
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,910
我来帮你
I'll help you.

277
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,500
但你要答应一个条件
But it's gonna cost you.

278
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,700
什么条件
What?

279
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,400
一个吻
A kiss.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,560
这简直就是赤裸裸的敲诈
That is pure blackmail.

281
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,860
是的 女士 没错
Well yes, ma'am it is,

282
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,800
不过我依然坚持我的要求
but that is still my condition.

283
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,540
那就说定了
That's the deal.

284
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,510
我会把你带上去
And I'm going to hold you to it.

285
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,690
等等
Well, hold on now.

286
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,430
你不会再扇我耳光了吧
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

287
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,970
因为要是我跌下去 我会把你也拽下去的
'Cause I'll fall off, I'm gonna take you with me.

288
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,490
那就吻我试试看吧
Kiss me and find out.

289
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,350
怎么了
What?

290
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,300
我必须去参军了
I have to enlist.

291
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,710
我不能待在后方 让他们为我拼命
I can't stay here while all them go fight for me.

292
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,570
你可以的
Yes, you can.

293
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,270
- 你可以待在这里 - 多萝西 我必须去
- You can stay here. - Dorothy, I have to.

294
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,690
我想去做医护兵
I want to be a medic.

295
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,580
我觉得我可以去救人 而不是去杀人
I figure I'll be saving people, not killing them.

296
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,510
我得去上班了 我快要迟到了
I have to go to work. I'm going to be late.

297
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,960
多萝西 亲爱的
Dorothy, darling.

298
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,210
多萝西 多萝西
Dorothy. Dorothy.

299
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,370
所以你是要向我求婚 还是怎么呢
So are you gonna ask me to marry you or what?

300
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,910
我不知道啊 你会答应我吗
Well, I don't know. You're still going to have me?

301
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,190
我也不知道 你还没问呢
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

302
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,320
那我这就求婚
Well, I'm asking you,

303
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,090
真心诚意
with all my heart and then some.

304
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,270
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

305
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,790
那我就答应吧
Then, yes.

306
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,480
我愿意
Yes. I will.

307
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,880
什么时候呢
When?

308
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,000
等到你第一次休假回家 我们就结婚
Soon as you get your first leave.

309
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
不过现在 我还是不喜欢你
But I still don't like you at this moment.

310
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,260
好吧
Yeah.

311
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,470
好吧
Okay.

312
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,980
我爱你
Okay. Well, I love you.

313
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,050
嘘
Shhhh.

314
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,490
妈妈说 在这里可以找到你
Momma said come see you here.

315
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,680
当初 他们三个是我最好的朋友
These three were my best friends.

316
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,620
我和他们一起长大
I grew up with 'em.

317
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,440
和他们一起闯祸 和他们一起追女孩
I got into trouble with 'em. Chased girls with 'em.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
然后也和他们一起入伍
And I enlisted with 'em.

319
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,350
现在 我的朋友们就在这里
Now my friends are there,

320
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,560
被泥土和野草覆盖 被虫子吞噬
covered in dirt and grasss, and eaten by worms.

321
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,930
我不想也来这里祭奠我的儿子们
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.

322

爸爸 我已经报名了

323
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,450
我别无选择啊 老爹
I couldn't do otherwise, pop.

324
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,120
- 其他人都... - 你不是其他人
- Everybody else is doing...- You ain't everybody else!

325
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,360
其他人都不加思考
Everybody else jumps in and does thing quick,

326
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,020
鲁莽行事
without thinking!

327
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,080
就像我们当初那样 都是白痴
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

328
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,250
你要明白 那些能活下来的士兵
You know what? Soldiers who live,

329
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,600
是因为他们有能力活下来
they live cause they can do that!

330
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,630
而你不行
You can't!

331
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,540
你得冷静下来
Look, you gotta sit

332
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,340
好好思考 好好祈祷
and think and pray about everything.

333
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
瞧瞧你 你现在就做得很好
I mean, look at you, you're doing it right now

334
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,840
如果你去了 你根本就活不下去
You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.

335
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,940
不 如果我不去 我才活不下去
No, I won't be able to live with myself if I don't.

336
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,290
我要去当医护兵
I'm going to be a medic.

337
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,920
我要以这种方式服役
That's going to be my way to serve.

338
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,160
看来你都想明白了啊
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

339
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,990
怎么着 你觉得这场战争会配合你吗
What, you figure this war is going to fit in with you?

340
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,090
配合你的想法吗
Your ideas?

341
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,870
我毫不怀疑 这肯定会非常艰难
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

342
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,880
不是艰难 而是根本就不可能
It won't be hard. It will be impossible.

343
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,710
你知道吗
You know, whatever

344
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
不管你那疯狂的脑子里 现在有什么想法
beliefs you have in your crazy head now,

345
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,520
战争都不会按你想的发展
they won't ever play out it.

346
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,080
战争从来都不是那样的
It don't work that way.

347
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,160
如果真有奇迹出现
And if by some, I don't know,

348
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,900
你能活下来
miracle chance you survive,

349
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,450
你也应该感谢上帝
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

女士们 请远离大巴
Ladies, please! Step away from the bus.

356
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,370
我差点忘了
I almost forgot.

357
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,450
我需要把撬棍 才能把你们分开吗
Do I need a crowbar?

358
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,120
给你

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,600
再见

364
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
我爱你
I love you.

365
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,930
不许那样说我女人
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

366
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,370
不好意思 兄弟
Hey. Sorry, pal.

我这里挨了一拳
I got a punch here.

369
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,430
不 只是被撞了下
Nah, it's just a bump.

370
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,620
难不成我每次走向自己的床位
Do I have to gaze at your deformity

371
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,110
还要盯着你那玩意看吗
everytime I walk to my bed?

372

看吧 看吧 你就嫉妒吧 朋友
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

他说的话 别人都听不懂
No one understand a word he says.

382
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,450
那是因为这里其他人都不读书

你是在嘲笑我吗
Are you grinning at me, boy,

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,250
还是说你平时就这样
or is that your natural state?

让人想要把你耳朵揪下来 二等兵

有问题吗 玉米秆二等兵

00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,600
你不喜欢这枪的尺寸

00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,870
还是不喜欢这枪的颜色呢

588
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,990
没有 中士
No, Sarge.

589
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,570
有人跟我说 我可以不用带武器
I was... I was told I don't have to carry a weapon.

590
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,730
再说一次 上前一步 二等兵
Come again, step forward, Private.

591
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,280
我刚才肯定是听错了
I can't be hearing this right.

592
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,740
我很抱歉 中士
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

593
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,900
我不能碰枪
I can't touch a gun.

594
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,830
所以 到底出什么问题了
What exactly is the problem?

595
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,840
没什么问题 只是个误会 长官
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

596
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,230
我报名参军时 已经和陆军说过...
I... I told the Army when I joined up...

597
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,490
那不可能
That's not possible.

598
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,340
你知道为什么不可能吗 二等兵
Do you know why it's not possible, Private?

599
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,180
不知道 长官
No, sir.

600
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,690
因为美国陆军是不会出错的
'Cause the United States Army does not make mistakes.

601
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,430
所以 如果有问题
So if there's a problem,

602
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,020
那肯定就是你的问题
you must be that problem.

603
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,200
我本不该被编入步兵连
I was just never supposed to be sent to a rifle company.

604
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,480
他是个拒绝服兵役者 长官
He's a CO, sir.

605
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,590
你是个拒绝服兵役者
You're a conscientious objector,

606
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,740
- 那你还来参军 - 你误会了 长官
- and you joined the army? - Well no, sir.

607
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,180
我只是坚持反对暴力而已
I'm... I'm a conscientious cooperator.

608
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,170
你是在耍我吗 道斯
Are you screwing with me, Doss?

609
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,130
我没有 长官 我是自愿参军
No. No, sir. I volunteered.

610
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,480
不管是穿军服 敬礼
I got no... no problem with wearing my uniform,

611
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,720
还是尽我的职责 我都没问题
or saluting the flag and... and doing my duty.

612
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,050
只是 持枪杀人 是绝对不行的
It's just... just carrying a gun and taking a human life.

613
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,360
你不杀生 是这个意思吗
You don't kill. That's all?

614
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,550
是的 长官 是这个意思
Yes, sir. That's all.

615
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,150
你知道战场上 干的就是杀人勾当吗
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in a war.

616
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,240
我知道 长官
Yes, Sir.

617
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,650
杀戮就是战争的本质
I mean that is the essential nature of war.

618
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,550
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

619
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
好吧
Alright.

620
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,980
那你对美国陆军还有什么其他要求吗
Do you have any other requirements of the United States army?

621
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,040
为了能让您在这里 和我们一起生活得舒心
Is there anything else that we can do to ensure

622
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,860
还有什么我们能为您做的吗
that you have a comfortable stay here with us?

623
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,560
他不想在周六执勤 长官
He doesn't wanna work on Saturday, sir.

624
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,970
周六是... 我信奉安息日会
Well, Saturday is... I'm a Seventh Day Adventist.

625
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,420
周六是安息日 所以
So... saturday is my sabbath, so...

626
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,170
我不能工作
I'm not allowed to work then.

627
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,620
在我看来 这完全不成问题
I don't think that poses a problem,

628
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,660
你觉得呢 中士
do you, Sergeant?

629
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,370
考虑到道斯二等兵是个虔诚的信徒
We should simply ask the enemy not to invade on the Sabbath,

630
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,240
我们应该通知敌人 让他们别在周六发动进攻
'cause Private Doss here is a prayer.

631
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,990
好了 事情已经很清楚了
Alright. Now we got that clear.

632
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,310
现在 我来跟你说说我的要求吧
Now let me tell you my requirements.

633
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,490
不像你的要求那么复杂
They're not as complicated as yours.

634
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,750
我的要求很简单
They are very simple.

635
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,720
只要你还在这个军营 只要你还是我的兵
As long as you're in this company under my command,

636
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,940
你就得遵守我的命令 完毕
you will obey my orders. Period.

637
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,030
如果在这里 你都不能服从命令
If you can't do it here,

638
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,650
那么在战场上 我就更不能信任你
I can't trust you to do it in the battle.

639
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,980
我会用第八条例来处理你
I'm putting you in

640
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,940
以精神问题为理由 遣送你回去
for a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

641
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,050
解散
Dismissed.

642
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,910
各位
Gentlemen!

643
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,160
我想向你们介绍一下 戴斯蒙德·道斯二等兵
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

644
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,890
显而易见
Apparently,

645
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,760
道斯二等兵反对暴力
Private Doss does not believe in violence.

646
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,800
他绝不会采取暴力行动
He does not practice violence.

647
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,190
甚至不会屈尊去碰武器
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

648
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,700
道斯二等兵
You see, Private Doss

649
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,490
是一位拒绝服兵役者
is a conscientious objector.

650
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,520
在此 我请求各位
So I plead with you,

651
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,710
在战场上 就别指望他来救你们了
do not look to him to save you on the battlefield,

652
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,790
因为他肯定会
because he will undoubtedly

653
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,530
忙着和他的良心作斗争 根本没时间理你们
be too busy wrestling with his conscience to assist.

654
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,190
中士 不是这样的 中士
Sarge, that's not true, Sarge.

655
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,500
二等兵 别说话
Private, as you were.

656
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,990
我知道
Now, I realize

657
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,360
各位对这件事一定有所怨言
some of you might have strong feelings about this.

658
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,450
我们浴血奋战
It is what we men fight for.

659
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,570
就是为了捍卫我们的权利
To defend our rights,

660
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,860
保护我们的女人和孩子
and to protect our women and children.

661
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,910
哪怕道斯二等兵的信仰
Even if Private Doss's belief

662
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,500
会对妇女儿童造成伤害
might cause women and children to die.

663
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,530
在此 我希望连队的每一位
So I will expect everyone in this company

664
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,370
能够给予道斯二等兵应得的尊敬
to give Private Doss the full measure of respect he is due

665
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,440
毕竟他在这里也待不久了
for the short time he will be with us.

666
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,430
明白了吗
Am I clear?

667
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,320
是 中士
Yes, sergeant.

668
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,070
你看什么呢 小妹妹
What'cha got there, Dessie?

669
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,090
你知道那是什么吗
You know what that is?

670
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,710
这个版本有点小啊
It just seems kind of small.

671
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,920
这本小圣经正适合你这个小男生
It's half-the-Bible for half-the-man.

672
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,600
拜托 史密提 把他的圣经还他吧
For Pete's sake, Smitty give him back his Bible.

673
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,490
我可没跟你说话
I don't remember speaking to you.

674
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,990
你为什么不动手呢
So, how come you don't fight?

675
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,440
你是不屑跟我们动手吗
You think you better than us?

676
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,130
不是
No.

677
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,300
那如果你被打了呢
Well, what if you're attacked?

678
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,260
例如 就像这样
Say, like that.

679
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:45,760
圣经告诉你
The Bible says

680
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,190
把另一侧脸也凑过来 不是吗
to turn your other cheekbone, don't it?

681
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,770
各位 我觉得这不是宗教信仰问题
See, I don't think this is a question of religion, fellas.

682
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,800
我觉得这就是懦弱
I think this is cowardice,

683
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,660
显而易见
plain and simple.

684
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,130
你还好吗 道斯
You alright, Doss?

685
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,930
你就是孬种 对吗
Are you chickenshit, that it?

686
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,930
来啊
Go on.

687
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
打我一拳
Take a poke.

688
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,400
告诉你 我让你随便打
Tell you what, I'm gonna give a free shot.

689
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,830
打这里
Right there.

690
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
打我啊 道斯
Hit me, Doss.

691
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
来啊
Go on.

692
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,050
揍他
Let him have it!

693
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,940
上啊
Go ahead.

694
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,060
不出手吗
No?

695
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,490
孬种
Chickenshit.

696
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,010
- 这是什么 - 还给我
- What is this? - Give me that.

697
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,500
这姑娘真水灵
This is a fine looking broad.

698
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,290
真漂亮
Nice.

699
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,320
传过来看看
Hey, pass it around.

700
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,760
只有真正的英雄才配得上
Now, this would be the kind of broad

701
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,180
这样的美人
that deserves a real man.

702
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,740
把照片还给我
Give me that back.

703
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,680
求我
Please.

704
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,430
求你
Please.

705
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,090
"求你 史密提 把照片还给我"
"Please give it back, Smitty."

706
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,110
求你 史密提 把照片还给我
Please give it back, Smitty.

707
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,430
你有出现幻听吗 戴斯蒙德
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

708
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,610
没有 长官
No, sir.

709
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,750
根据我的理解 上帝会跟你说话
But I understand that God talks to you.

710
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,810
对吗
Is that right?

711
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,770
长官 我并不是个疯子
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

712
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,640
那大家都认为你疯了
Then how you feel... most people regard you,

713
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,520
你有什么感受呢
a... a crazy person?

714
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,100
我知道我和大家不一样 但...
I'm... I'm different. I know that. But...

715
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,570
我没打算强迫自己装得和大家一样
I'm not gonna pretend to be something I'm not.

716
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
我就是我
I am what I am.

717
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,240
听起来很孤独啊
Sounds lonely.

718
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,330
你孤独吗
Are you lonely?

719
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,050
所以你没有出现幻听 是吗
So, you don't hear voices?

720
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,090
没有 长官
No, sir.

721
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,010
我向上帝祈祷
I pray to God

722
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,920
希望他能听见
and I like to think He hears me,

723
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,890
但我并没有和他聊天
but it ain't a conversation,

724
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,400
并非像我们正在假装的这样
like the one we're pretending to have right now.

725
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,610
假装吗 二等兵
Pretending, Private?

726
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,480
是的 长官 我知道你想...
Well, yes, sir. I know what you really wanna do is...

727
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,650
想用第八条例把我赶出军队
is give me a section 8, draw me out of the Army.

728
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,450
但我没疯
But... I'm not off...

729
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,680
我脑子没问题
Up above.

730
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,050
我只是坚守我的信仰而已
I just simply believe what I believe.

731
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,160
我在尽量试图理解你 好吗
Well, I'm trying to understand, alright?

732
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,400
是上帝告诉你 不要拿枪的吗
Was it...  Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?

733
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,840
上帝说 不要杀戮
God says not to kill.

734
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,130
那是十诫中最重要的一条
That's one of His most important commandments.

735
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,770
但大家都将其理解为 "不蓄意谋杀他人"
Most people take that to mean, "Don't commit murder."

736
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,260
战争 则是特殊情况
War is completely differen set of circumstances.

737
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,050
主说 "我赐给你们一条新的诫律
Jesus said "A new commandment I give unto you,

738
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,800
乃是叫你们彼此相爱
That you love one another,

739
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,160
如同我爱你一般"
just as I have loved you."

740
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,230
我们面对的可是恶魔撒旦本人
This is satan himself we're fighting.

741
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,940
作为一名虔诚的基督教徒 你应该能明白
Surely, as good Christian, you can see that.

742
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,010
我明白 长官 所以我才来参军了
I can see that, sir, and that is why I joined up.

743
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,900
但很抱歉 我不会碰任何武器的
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

744
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,050
毫无疑问 他的信仰非常独特
His religious view is certainly unique,

745
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,910
但并不合适采用条例第八章
but they do not constitute grounds

746
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,410
没法把他赶出军队
for Section 8 discharge.

747
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,500
有他这样的人
How am I supposed to

748
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,010
在我队伍里 我要如何才能维持秩序呢
maintain discipline with a man like that in my unit?

749
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,020
我不知道
I don't know.
在我队伍里 我要如何才能维持秩序呢
maintain discipline with a man like that in my unit?

750
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,930
我不知道
I don't know.

751
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,810
但他出于信仰而拒绝服兵役 是合法的
But he is a legitimate conscientious objector,

752
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,010
只要能完成所有训练内容
and he must be allowed to work as combat medic,

753
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,250
他就能以医护兵的身份 留在军队里
provided he qualifies in all other areas in his training.

754
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,370
或许我们可以帮助他 改变其想法
Perhaps we could help make believe in his idea.

755
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,970
没错 你让他只负责营房和厨房的杂事
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks in KP.

756
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,870
他只要跟你说起上帝 你就给他点颜色看看
If he throws God at you, you throw hell right at him.

757
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,320
我要他走
I want him gone.

758
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,130
道斯 你的床太乱了
Doss, your area is in disgrace.

759
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,880
简直就像个猪窝
It's a pig stock.

760
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,700
- 有什么好笑的吗 雷克 - 没有 中士
- Something funny, Ryker? - No, Sarge!

761
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,540
- 你脑子有毛病吗 - 没有 中士
- You got some shit on your mind? - No, Sarge!

762
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,800
你们没有意识到的
What you men fail to recognize

763
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,670
团队中最弱者的能力 才真正决定团队的水平
is a unit is no better than its weakest member.

764
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,420
为了帮助你们学习这个道理
Now, to help you learn that lesson,

765
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,960
这个周末 所有人都不许外出
there will be no passes this weekend.

766
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,130
全都滚到厨房去帮忙
You will all be on KP.

767
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,200
现在 所有人全副武装 二十英里的负重越野
Right now everybody on full gear for 20-mile hike.

768
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,430
快点
Let's go.

769
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
出发
Let's go.

770
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,180
保持清醒
Get your heads right.

771
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,050
不要自怨自艾
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

772
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,130
看到你们自怨自艾的样子 我就觉得恶心
Makes me sick seeing you feel sorry for yourself.

773
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,450
你们根本就不知道什么是累
You dogs don't know what tired is.

774
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,170
我不停下 你们都别想休息
We gonna keep going till I drop.

775
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,660
来吧 伙计们
Come on, guys.

776
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,500
别打了 别打了
Hey, knock it off. Knock it off!

777
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,450
我还要睡觉呢
Trying to sleep here.

778
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,510
别碰我 别碰我
Get off me. Get off me.

779
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,030
你他妈到底为什么还赖着不走呢
Why the hell are you still here?

780
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,340
- 立正 - 稍息
- Ten-hut.- As you were.

781
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,350
道斯呢
Where's Doss?

782
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,100
这对任何人都没有好处
This isn't good for anybody.

783
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,600
这确实不是我当初报名参军的原因
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

784
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,790
这跟你参军的原因没关系
It's not about what you joined up for.

785
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,200
而是关乎这里所有人的性命
It's about the lives of every men in here.

786
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,210
还有你的性命 小子
And yours, son.

787
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,600
是时候退出了
It's time you quit this.

788
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,190
穿好衣服 我送你出去
Finish getting dress and I'll walk you down.

789
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,470
没事的 道斯
It's okay, Doss.

790
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,990
没什么好羞耻的
There's no shame in this.

791
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
走吧
Let's go.

792
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,490
我今天还要值班
I got an extra guard duty today,

793
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,440
早上还要去厨房帮忙 所以...
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

794
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,080
走不了
I can't.

795
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,530
好吧 道斯
Alright, Doss.

796
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,350
道斯二等兵
Private Doss,

797
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,410
你能认出打你的人吗
can you identify the men that beat you?

798
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,390
不 中士
No, Sarge.

799
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,280
你是说 你不知道谁打了你吗
Are you saying that you don't know who attacked you?

800
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,710
我没说我被打了啊 中士
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

801
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,940
你到底在说什么呢 道斯
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

802
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,120
你睡觉睡得遍体鳞伤的吗
You bruised half your body sleeping?

803
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,330
我睡相确实很差
I... I sleep pretty hard.

804
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,730
好吧
Alright.

805
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,060
如果这个周末 你们打算要享受艳福
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,

806
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,390
- 要记得做安全措施噢  -下一个
- make sure you put on a hat. - Next!

807
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,720
我可不想看你们带着一身骚味回来
I don't want anyone coming back pissing cream.

808
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,100
难道你不想享受享受吗 中士
What, you don't want to none for your coffee, Sarge?

809
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,710
那现在就来一发吧 史密提
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

810
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,790
- 这是你的经验之谈吗 中士 - 下一个
- You speaking from experience, Sarge? - Next.

811
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,020
你去问问你妈就知道了 胖球
You'd have to ask your mom about that, greaseball.

812
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,550
敬礼
Move!

813
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,850
稍息
At ease.

814
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,780
道斯二等兵
Private Doss,

815
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,710
恐怕我不能批准你外出
I'm afraid I can't authorize your pass.

816
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,990
只有通过所有基础训练项目 才能享有假期
This is a furlough for men who had pass the basic training.

817
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,650
恕我直言 长官 我已经通过了
Well, sir... respectfully, sir, I have.

818
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,160
我三周前就开始申请这次外出了
I... I put in for this furlough three weeks ago.

819
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,670
今天下午 我就要结婚了
I'm getting married this afternoon.

820
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,850
上面写着 你没有通过步枪测试
It says you're not rifle-qualified.

821
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,560
但我不需要佩枪 长官
Well, I'm not required to carry a rifle, sir.

822
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,820
上校... 施特尔策上校 他...
Colonel... Colonel Stelzer he...

823
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,460
施特尔策上校的规矩是说
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

824
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,520
"如果道斯想要留在军队 做医护兵
"Doss must be allowed to work as a combat medic,

825
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,090
他必须通过所有的训练测试"
provided he qualifies in all other areas of his training."

826
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,310
但你并没有通过步枪训练 二等兵
And you have not qualifiedon the rifle range, private.

827
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,120
非常清楚
Pretty clear.

828
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,940
让我看看 你会不会拿枪
Show me you know how to handle a rifle,

829
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,930
如果你会 我就批准你外出
and I'll sign your furlough.

830
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,320
- 坎农下士 - 长官
- Corporal Cannon. - Sir.

831
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,930
把你的佩枪递给道斯二等兵
Hand private Doss your firearm.

832
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,270
我不会碰枪的 长官
I won't touch a rifle, sir.

833
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,540
我没有在询问你的意见 二等兵
I'm not asking you, Private.

834
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,150
这是指挥官给你下达的直接指令
That is a direct order from a company commander.

835
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,830
看在上帝的份上 道斯
For God's sake, Doss,

836
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,440
别胡闹了 退出吧
you stop this nonsense and quit.

837
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,560
如果你拒绝
Refuse,

838
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,100
那我就只能把你送上军事法庭了
and I will have no recourse but to court martial you,

839
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,680
在整个战争期间
and you will spend

840
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,600
你都将只能待在军事监狱里
the duration of the war in a military prison.

841
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:06,980
我做不到 长官
I can't, sir.

842
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,140
你还想等多久 多萝西
How much longer would you like to wait, Dorothy?

843
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,540
我想 我们已经等得够久了
I think it's been long enough.

844
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,270
很抱歉
I'm so very sorry.

845
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,450
有时候男人就会临阵退缩
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

846
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,860
有些男人可能会吧
Some men might.

847
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,600
但我的戴斯蒙德不会
Not my Desmond.

848
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,700
你可能认为 我就是个混蛋
You probably think I'm a really son of a bitch

849
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,930
只在乎规定 而不爱惜自己手下
who cares only about regulations and not his men.

850
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
我可以看一下吗
May I?

851
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,730
我和其他人一样 也对圣经深信不疑
I believe in this book as much as any men.

852
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,550
也和其他人一样
And just like any man,

853
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,830
良心备受煎熬
I wrestled with my conscience,

854
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,720
但当这世上你所珍视的一切
but what do you do

855
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,650
都受到攻击时 你该怎么办
when everything you value in this world is under attacked?

856
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,080
我不知道 长官
I don't know, sir.

857
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,540
我不能回答如此深刻的问题
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

858
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,500
但我也感觉到 我的价值观正受到冲击
but I also feel like my values are under attack,

859
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,520
我甚至都不知道为什么
and I don't know why.

860
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,820
我可不在乎你那什么鬼原则
I don't give a rat-ass

861
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,170
因为日本人也不会在乎
about your principles because the Japs don't.

862
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,180
如果敌人袭击你
If one of them attacks you

863
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,320
和其他受伤的士兵 你该怎么办
and some wounded soldier, what are you gonna do?

864
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,490
用圣经打他吗
Hit him with your Bible?

865
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,250
我愿意为我的队友 献出生命
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

866
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,100
光靠牺牲自己的生命 并不能赢得战争
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

867
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:06,950
听着
Look.

868
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,210
我来这里
I'm only here because

869
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,520
是因为 我不想看到你被困在监狱里
I don't wanna see you rotting in a prison cell.

870
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,070
认罪吧
Plead guilty,

871
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,780
在法庭上 请求他们的宽恕
throw yourself at the mercy of the court.

872
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,820
或许他们会让你安然无恙地回家
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

873
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,100
让那些勇敢的人 去赢得这场战争吧
Let the brave men out there go and win this war.

874
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,540
如果我说服不了你 或许她可以
If I can't convinceyou, maybe she can.

875
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,630
他们不让我打电话给你
They wouldn't let me call you.

876
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,410
我就知道这不是你的错
I knew it wasn't your making.

877
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,360
他们对你干了什么
What've they done to you?

878
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,320
没事 我没事
It's okay. I'm alright.

879
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,970
我只是跟墙打了几个回合 然后输了而已
I just went a couple of rounds with the wall and lost.

880
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,450
他们说你很可能被送进监狱 戴斯蒙德
They're saying you could go to prison, Desmond.

881
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,640
利文沃斯堡监狱
Leavenworth.

882
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,160
肯定还有其他办法
There must be some other way.

883
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,150
我不知道还能怎么办
I don't know what that could be.

884
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,780
除了碰枪这件事
I've done everything they asked me

885
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,760
他们说的我全照做了
except this one thing,

886
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,970
就因为我不肯杀人
and I'm being treated like a criminal

887
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,240
他们就如同对待犯人般对待我
just 'cause I won't kill.

888
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,270
你尽力了
You tried.

889
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,560
没人能否认这一点
Nobody can say you didn't.

890
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,760
但你在监狱里 能救到谁呢
But who are you gonna save in prison?

891
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,800
估计谁也救不了吧
Probably nobody.

892
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,440
那你为什么 就不能拿起那该死的枪
Then why can't you just pick up the stupid gun

893
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,590
随便装装样子呢
and wave it around.

894
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,400
你不需要用它 只要做出让步就好了
You don't have to use it, just meet them halfway.

895
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,390
但我做不到
But I can't do that.

896
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,690
你可以的 你只是太骄傲了
Yes, you can. It's just pride.

897
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,630
骄傲又顽固
Pride and stuborness.

898
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
不要混淆你的意志和主的意志
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

899
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,350
我很骄傲吗
Have I been prideful?

900
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,180
或许我确实很骄傲
Maybe I am prideful.

901
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,720
但如果不坚持我自己的信仰
But I don't know how I'm going to live with myself

902
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,030
我都不知道 该怎样生活下去
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

903
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,690
更重要的是 该怎样和你一起生活
much less how you could live with me.

904
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,560
我永远不会成为 你眼中真正的男人
I'd never be the man that I want to be in your eyes.

905
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,080
我之所以爱你
I fell in love with you

906
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,370
因为你跟其他人不一样
because you weren't like anyone else.

907
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,590
而你也不曾改变自己
and you didn't try to be.

908
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,610
永远不要觉得 你会让我失望
Do not think for one moment that you'll disappoint me.

909
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,950
无论怎样
I will love you,

910
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,140
我都爱你
no matter what.

911
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,360
我不知道他要怎么办
I don't know what he's gonna do.

912
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,660
不管怎样 他都会输
He loses no matter what.

913
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,660
他们想要他认罪
They want him to plead guilty

914
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,940
但这样他就会被开除军籍...
but then he'll get dishonorable discharge...

915
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,350
或者拒不认罪 那他肯定会进监狱的
Otherwise he fights them, he for sure goes to prison.

916
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,590
不管怎样 他都会被人们称作懦夫
Either way, they'll call him a coward

917
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,430
我不知道他怎么能那样活下去
and I don't see how he can live with that.

918
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,930
谢谢 多萝西
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

919
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,660
如果你有机会跟他说话
If you get to talk to him,

920
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,590
告诉他 我们爱他
tell him that we love him

921
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,880
我们为他祷告
and that  we're praying for him.

922
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,090
为你们俩祈祷
We're praying for both of you.

923
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
我会的
I will.

924
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,550
再见
Bye-bye.

925
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,890
你能不要烦我吗
Will you leave me alone?

926
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,130
你能走开吗
Will you just go?

927
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,170
汤姆 你已经疯了 简直不可理喻...
Tom, you're out of your mind, you're delirious...

928
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,860
我当然是疯了
Of course I'm out of my mind.

929
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,390
不然呢 我已经疯了
What do you think I am? I'm out of my mind.

930
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,680
你给我滚出这间房 蠢女人
Will you leave this room? Stupid woman!

931
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,320
天哪 把枪放下
God! Put it down!

932
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,020
死女人 离我远点
Get away from me, woman.

933
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,110
明白了 先生
I got that, sir.

934
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,180
我有什么能帮您吗 先生
May I help you, sir?

935
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,150
我想跟斯格罗夫准将说几句话
I wish to speak to Brigadier General Musgrove.

936
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,370
没有预约 是不行的
Not without an appointment you can't.

937
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,810
那是不可能的
That would be quite impossible.

938
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,340
能请你转告他
If you would kindly tell him

939
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,850
托马斯·道斯下士想跟他说几句话吗
Corporal Thomas Doss would appreciate a brief word.

940
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,600
他在参加一个很重要的会议
He is in a very important meeting.

941
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,220
在法国贝洛森林战役中 我曾与他并肩作战
I fought with him in France at Belleau Wood.

942
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,880
当时 他是我的上尉
He was my Captain.

943
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,680
求你了 女士 我有很重要的事
Please ma'am. It's... It's most vital.

944
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,550
谢谢你 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

945
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,870
外面有位叫做托马斯·道斯的人想要见您
There's a man out there, Thomas Doss, wants to see you.

946
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:57,750
道斯
Doss?

947
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,730
很快就能结束
Be over in a minute.

948
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,170
你很快就能安全回家了
You'll be home safe and sound,

949
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,300
就像什么都没发生过一样
like nothing ever happened.

950
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
我爱你
I love you.

951
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,780
本次听证会 被告为戴斯蒙德·道斯二等兵
This is a hearing into the matter of Private Desmond Doss.

952
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,390
其罪名为
The charge is disobeying

953
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,890
不服从指挥官的多项指令
a series of direct orders from his commanding officer.

954
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,530
被告方做何辩护
How says the defendant?

955
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,540
道斯二等兵 希望做无罪辩护
Private Doss wishes to enter a "not guilty" plea.

956
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,680
是吗 二等兵 我本以为已经谈妥了
Is that so, Private? I thought this was agreed.

957
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,360
你打算认罪 达成协议
You wanted to enter some sort of plea bargain.

958
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,530
- 是的 长官 但我改变主意了 - 就这样吗
- Yes, sir. But I changed my mind.- Just like that?

959
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,940
你想继续在军事法庭上辩护吗
You wish to proceed to a court-martial.

960
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,070
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

961
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,660
那后果自负 二等兵
Well, on your head, then. Private.

962
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
请继续
Proceed.

963
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:36,890
法官大人
Your honor,

964
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,710
道斯二等兵
Private Doss

965
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,450
到处炫耀他的道德观
waves his morality at us,

966
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
就像炫耀荣誉勋章
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

967
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,990
通过违抗
He flaunts his contempt

968
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,110
直属指挥官的一系列指令
by directly disobeying

969
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,390
来显示自己的轻蔑之情
a series of direct orders from his commanding officer.

970
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,020
与此同时 我们国家最出色的年轻人们
When the very best of our young men

971
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,290
正在战场上 不惜生命 抗击...
are sacrificing their lives against...

972
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,660
- 你还好吧 - 还好
- You okay? - Yes.

973
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,130
- 还在审议吗 - 是的
- Are they still deliberating? - Yes, sir.

974
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,350
好吧 你把这个拿进去
Okay, now you go take this in there.

975
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,640
不行 非军事人员不得入内
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

976
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,680
那你要他们中一个拿进去吧
Well, then you get one of them to take it in.

977
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,080
他们不会帮忙的 他们都恨不能把他埋了
They ain't out to help. They're fixing to burying him.

978
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,610
军事法庭只需询问被告
There's only one question

979
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,250
一个简单问题就可以了
that any military court need ask of the accused.

980
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,440
你要否认 自己曾违抗塞恩斯顿上校的直接命令吗
Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

981
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,990
你否认吗 二等兵
Well, do you, Private?

982
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,950
不 长官 我不否认
No, sir. I don't.

983
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,700
那你到底在争论什么
Why are you contesting it, then?

984
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,500
你既然拒绝触碰武器 那到底为什么
Why is it so important to you, given your refusal to even

985
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,950
要加入战斗分队呢
touch a weapon to serve in a combat unit?

986
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,260
因为在日本人袭击珍珠港后
Because when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor,

987
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,890
我也感同身受
I took it personal.

988
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,530
我认识的每个人 都热血沸腾地想参军
Everyone I knew was on fire to join up,

989
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,730
其中也包括我
including me.

990
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,680
在我的家乡 有两个人
There were two men in my hometown,

991
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,820
因为体检不合格
declared 4-F unfit,

992
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,220
没能入伍 而选择了自杀
they killed themselves 'cause they couldn't serve.

993
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,140
之前 我在兵工厂工作
I had a job in a defense plant,

994
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,710
本来可以申请延期服役 但那是不对的
and I could've taken a deferment, but that ain't right.

995
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,190
当其他人都在战场上 浴血奋战时
It isn't right that other men should fight and die,

996
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,070
我却在家高枕无忧 这样是不对
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

997
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,440
我要报效祖国
I need to serve.

998
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,450
我有热情也有能力 成为一名医护兵
I got the energy and the passion to serve as a medic,

999
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,610
与其他人并肩战斗 同甘共苦
right in the middle with the other guys, no less danger,

1000
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,320
只是...
just...

1001
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,570
当其他人都在夺取生命时
while everybody else is taking life,

1002
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,070
我将会拯救生命
I'm going to be saving it.

1003
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,040
世界已经开始分崩离析
With the world so set on tearing itself apart,

1004
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,890
而有人想要尽力 维持一点点原样
it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me

1005
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,270
在我看来 这似乎并不是坏事
to want to put a little bit of it back together.

1006
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,400
- 抱歉 先生 任何人禁止入内 - 不
- Sorry, sir, nobody is allowed to... - No,

1007
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,580
你不明白 我的儿子是被告
You don't understand. My son is the defendant.

1008
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,570
我明白 先生
I understand, sir.

1009
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,180
但任何人禁止入内
But nobody is allowed...

1010
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,840
我有重要的消息
I have information, that's important.

1011
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,630
先生 你不能...
Sir, you are not allowed...

1012
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,760
虽然你表达的精神值得赞赏
While the sentiments expressed are laudable,

1013
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,790
然而被控的罪行 却是无可争辩 所以...
the facts of the charge seem incontestable, so...

1014
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,130
外面发生什么事了
What the hell is going on out there?

1015
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,010
- 先生 - 让他进来吧
- Sir. - Let him go.

1016
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:13,910
那是一战的制服
That's a Great War uniform.

1017
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,160
是的 长官
It is, sir.

1018
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,420
长官 我想让您看看这个
Sir, I need to show you this.

1019
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,720
我没有冒犯的意思 先生
With respect, sir,

1020
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,010
但您已经不再是军人了
you are no longer a member of the military.

1021
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,390
您不能参加这次听证会 我很抱歉
You're unable to attend this hearing. I'm sorry.

1022
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,110
现在军队真的是这样了吗 长官
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

1023
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,360
你为国家而战
You fight for your country,

1024
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,320
失去了许多宝贵的东西
you lose so much that were dear to you,

1025
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,760
然后你却一文不值吗
and then you're done with?

1026
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,920
军装被遗忘 老兵被漠视
The uniform's forgotten. You have no voice?

1027
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,530
您参加了里昂战役吗
You were at Lyons?

1028
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,700
是的 长官 以及贝洛森林战役
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

1029
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,410
两次都被授予了勋章 我看到了 先生
Twice decorated. I see it, sir.

1030
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,840
我想您是这位二等兵的父亲
I take it you're the Private's father.

1031
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,880
没错 长官 我是托马斯·道斯
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

1032
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,470
那么作为一名退役军人
Then, as former military man,

1033
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,040
您应该知道这里的法律
you know there are laws here.

1034
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,050
长官 我知道那些法律
Sir, I know the law.

1035
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,400
我也知道 法律会维护我儿子应该有的权利
and I know my son is protected by those laws.

1036
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,510
这些都是被宪法所保障的
They are framed in our constitution.

1037
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,580
我相信这些法律 他也一样
And I believe in them, as he does.

1038
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,500
正是为了捍卫我们的法律 我才会去报名参军
They are why I went and fought to protect them.

1039
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,490
至少当初我奔赴战场时 我是这样想的
At least that's what I thought I was doing

1040
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,810
因为 如果不是那样
because if it wasn't for that

1041
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,870
那我就不知道我为何而战 长官
then I have no idea what the hell I was doing there, sir.

1042
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,630
谢谢您 道斯下士
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

1043
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,550
把信交给我吧
Let me have the letter.

1044
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
您必须离开
You must go.

1045
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,570
"国会法案保护
"The defendant's rights as a

1046
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,650
被告所拥有 出于信仰拒绝服兵役的权利"
conscientious objector are protected by an Act of Congress."

1047
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,910
"并且不能强迫他放弃这些权利
"And he cannot be compelled to waive those rights.

1048
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,090
包括本案中
That includes in this case

1049
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,870
他拥有的违反军令拒绝拿起武器的权利"
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

1050

签名 斯格罗夫准将

1052
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:58,780
上校
Colonel?

1053
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,470
我撤回指控 长官
I withdraw the charges, sir.

1054
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,450
那么案件审理结束
Then this case is dismissed.

1055
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,800
道斯二等兵 你被允许 可以手无寸铁
Private Doss, you are free to run into the hell fire of

1056
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,960
冲进硝烟弥漫的战场了
battle without a single weapon to protect yourself.

1057
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,990
你将重拾责任
You may resume your duties

1058
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,120
受训成为一名医护兵
and begin training as a combat medic.

1059
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,790
- 他在哪儿 - 走了
- Where is he? - Gone.

1060
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,520
他出来就直接离开了 我求过他留下来
Straight after. I begged him to stay.

1061
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,610
- 我告诉过他 你肯定想见他 - 我明白
- I told him you'd want to see him. - No, I understand.

1062
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,770
等你回家了 告诉他 我爱他
When you get home, you tell him I love him.

1063
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,970
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

1064
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,810
你一定要回家 回我身边
You better come home to me.

1065
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,100
# 山姆大叔微微笑 平静似小孩 #
Uncle Sam is smiling. Peaceful as a child

1066
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,860
# 但千万不要把他惹恼 #
But never get him rowdy.

1067
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,190
别唱了 大明星
Cut it out, Hollywood.

1068
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:36,810
闭嘴吧

1071

我发誓 大明星 我要毙了你

用袜子堵上嘴 可以吗

等我们到了再高歌也不迟
Save the choir for when we get there.

1074
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,320
真是扫兴
Killjoy is here.

Give 'em room.

1076

- 让开 - 借过

1077
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,670

01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:43,320
就剩这么点儿人了
Or what's left of them.

1079
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,350
我们就是要去轮换这些人
These are the guys we are replacing.

你 我还有佩奇
You, and me and Page here

1096
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,960
是这片区域仅剩的医护兵了 所以...
are about the only medics weg ot left in this area. So...

1097
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,260
我想我们将要团结协作
I guess we're going to be working together.

1098
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,560
你们刚刚从前线下来吗
You just come off the line?

1099
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,140
那里怎么样
What's it like?

1100
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,070
我问 那里怎么样
I said, what's it like?

1101
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,770
钢锯岭吗
Hacksaw?

1102
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,240
我们攀爬了六次
We climbed up six times.

1103
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,540
六次 都被他们击退
Six times, they threw us off.

1104
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:44,040
上次进攻之后 九十六步兵团已经所剩无几
Last time, there wasn't anything left of the 96th.

1105
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,990
他们是禽兽
They're animals.

1106
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,630
散发恶臭的禽兽
Stinking animals.

1107
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,250
日本人不在乎自己的死活
Nips don't care if they live or die.

1108
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,730
他们悍不畏死
They want to die.

1109
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,480
他们不断地发起冲锋
They keep coming at you.

1110
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,780
而且从不放弃
And they ain't never going to give up.

来 伙计
Here. Hey, buddy.

1113
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,900
这些日本人专门瞄准伤员
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

1114
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,920
取下你所有的红十字标记
Lose all your red cross markings.

1115
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,180
对于击杀医护兵 日军有额外奖赏
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

1116
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,590
那块白布太显眼了
That white's a bull's-eye.

1117
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,740
我给你找了个新头盔

那就是我们的目标
That's our objective.

1120
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,170
钢锯岭
Hacksaw Ridge.

1121
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,750
只要拿下它 也许我们就能拿下冲绳
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

1122
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:45,110
拿下冲绳 我们就拿下了整个日本
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

1123
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,530
稍事休息
Take a breather.

1124
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,210
我们的海军弟兄们 会先替我们轰炸他们
Our pals in the Navy are gonna soften them up for us.

1125
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,080
没人能从这种攻击中活下来
Nobody can survive that shit.

1126
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,090
他们可以
Oh, but they can.

1127
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:40,870
中尉
Lieutenant.

1128
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,210
堡垒在这里 这里 还有这里 对吗
these bunkers here, here and here. Is that accurate?

1129
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,220
这里有三个...
Yeah, there's three...

1130
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,520
没错 长官 也许比地图上再往后点 但...
Yes, sir. Maybe they look further back, but it's all...

1131
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,710
在上面 情况完全不同
it's all different up there.

1132
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,190
发射完毕 上尉
All clear, Captain.

1133
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,830
大兵们
Gents.

1134
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,220
出发
Move out!

1135
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,030
这是血
It's blood.

1136
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,530
那还用说
No shit.

1137
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,110
我们不是在堪萨斯州了 小妹妹
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

1138
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,410
继续爬
Keep climbing.

1139

A soldier who doesn't is a dead one.

1206
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,190

1209
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,480
- 放这里 - 把他放下 放在这里
- Here. - Put him down. Put him down here.

1210
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,490
优先权 你没听过伤员分类吗
A priority? You haven't heard of triage?

1211
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:37,910
在我们送他下去之前 他就会坚持不住了
He'll be dead before we get him down.

1212
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:39,150
你怎么知道呢
you don't know that!

1213
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,630

救救我 救救我
Help! Help!

1221
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,390
我觉得 如果我们看不到他们
I figured if we can't see them,

1222
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,230
那他们也看不到我们

1278
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:07,410
今晚好好休息
Dig in for the night.

1279
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:08,530
只要我们守住这里
We hold this spot.

1280
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,690
明天就能扫平整个山岭
We mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.

1281
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,010
现在 孩子们
Okay boys.

1282
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,330
都给自己找个舒服的安全窝
Find yourself a nice safe hole.

1283
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,610
躲在掩体里 或者待边上也行
In or near the bunker.

1284
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,380
每两小时换岗放哨
Rotate watch every two hours.

1285
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,980
我们都不知道外边还有什么
We don't know what's out there.

1286
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,630
所以 尽量放低身体
Heads down, asses lower.

1287
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:23,520
任何不说英语的人 都格杀勿论
Shoot anything that don't speak English.

1288
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,580
包括格雷斯吗 中士
That includes Grease, Sarge?

1289
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:25,790
尤其是他
Particularly him.

1290
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,650
我不管你是要撒泡尿 还是蹲大号
I don't care if you need to take a piss or a dump.

1291
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,630
都不能独自出去
It ain't safe to go out there alone.

1292
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,250
道斯 你他妈要去哪里
Where the hell you going, Doss?

1293
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,200
报告中士 外边还有很多伤员
Still more wounded out there, sarge.

1294
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,860
我跟他一起去
I'll go with him.

1295
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:41,440
机灵点 小心行事
Be smart, keep your ears down.

1296
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,430
好了 大家先找地方吧
All right, let's find a spot.

1297
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:55,360
开战不到十五分钟 瓦拉利和亨利就死了
Rinnelli and Henry dead in the first 15 minutes.

1298
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,980
直接挂了
Just straight off.

1299
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,400
真是干脆
It's straight off.

1300
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:01,610
彼德森
Peterson.

1301
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,640
大眼
Popeye.

1302
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,030
斯坦福和墨菲
Stanford and Murphy.

1303
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,220
佩奇和昂格尔
Page and Unger.

1304
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,750
还有拉斯顿.
Ralston

1305
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,350
"和平年代 黑发人送白发人"
"In peace sons bury their fathers."

1306
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,280
"战争到来 白发人送黑发人"
"In war fathers bury their sons."

1307
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,740
别说这些丧气话了 行吗
You wanna stop spouting that crap?

1308
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,860
没有任何作用
It don't help none.

1309
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,230
是啊
Yeah.

1310
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,490
你说的没错
Yeah, you got that right.

1311
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,960
在这是没用
Not here.

1312
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,260
让我来吧
Give me that.

1313
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,900
喂
Hey!

1314
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,380
喂
Hey!

1315
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,080
这位腹部受伤
We got an abdominal wound.

1316
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,320
这兄弟需要输点血
This lad is gonna need some plasma.

1317
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,480
- 没问题 - 交给我们吧
- You got it. - Leave him with us.

1318
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,910
好的 你安全了
Okay. You're okay now.

1319
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,410
他们会照顾好你的
They got you.

1320
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,630
我们要不要找个地方 吃点东西
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1321
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,810
是个好主意
Sounds good to me.

1322
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,210
把钢盔戴上吧
Put your helmet on.

1323
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,600
你不来点吗
You ain't gonna eat that?

1324
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,580
我不吃肉
I don't eat meat.

1325
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
你吃吧
Help yourself.

1326
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:27,820
你当然不吃肉了
Of course you don't.

1327
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,780
她可真是漂亮
That's one heck of a dame.

1328
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:41,990
你真是配不上这个美人
You know you're fighting out of

1329
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,470
你知道这点 对吗
your weight class with her,don't you?

1330
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:51,980
是的 我知道
Yes, I do.

1331
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,430
可别这么跟她说
Don't tell her that.

1332
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,170
她要是和我这样的人在一起 肯定会更幸福
She'd be much happier with a man like me anyway.

1333
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,900
没错 不过等她认清你就不会了
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1334
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,420
有时候 我确实挺混蛋的
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1335
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
只是有时候吗
Sometimes?

1336
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,340
你说的没错 好吧
You're alright. Alright.

1337
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,430
这些日本人很狡猾
These Japs are sneaky.

1338
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,480
我来放第一班哨
I'll take first watch.

1339
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,100
你先休息会吧
And you get some shut-eye.

1340
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,780
肯定是场噩梦
Hell of a dream.

1341
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,880
我梦到 敌人用刺刀杀死了我
Dreamed I got myself skewered.

1342
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,220
而我却毫无办法
I couldn't do nothing.

1343
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,960
枪就在这里
Rifle's just there.

1344
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,080
不会咬人的
It won't bite.

1345
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:03,710
不对 它会的
Yeah, it will.

1346
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,170
看看周围死的人
Look around you.

1347
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,020
在经历这一切之后
After what we've just been through,

1348
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,010
任何正常人 就会拼命想要武器
any sane man would be screaming for a weapon.

1349
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,840
我可没说过 我是正常人
I never claimed to be sane.

1350
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,590
我爸爸是个酒鬼
My daddy is a drunk.

1351
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,350
多年以来 他一直想戒掉
He fought it for years,

1352
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,060
但始终没能成功
but it kinda got a hold of him hard.

1353
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,340
所以脾气很糟糕
Made him mean.

1354
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,440
至少你还知道自己父亲是谁
Least you knew him.

1355
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,840
而我父亲却可能是十来个男人中的任意一个
Mine could've been any one of the ten guys

1356
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,650
而且他们谁都不配 所以...
and none of them would worth a damn, so...

1357
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,350
所以 是你妈妈把你养大的吗
So, your momma raised you?

1358
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,200
我记得她
I knew her.

1359
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,620
但在我五岁时 她就把我送进了孤儿院
But she gave me to an orphanage when I was five.

1360
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,980
从此就再没见过她
Never saw her again.

1361
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,840
我学会了麻利做事
I learned how to act quick.

1362
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,720
学会了迅速识人
Learned how to judge people quicker,

1363
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,450
但却看错你了 大错特错
and I got you very wrong.

1364
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:01,160
我爸经常揍我和我哥
My daddy used to beat me and my brother

1365
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,990
太阳上山的时候打 太阳下山的时候抽
just because the sun rose and then whip us because it set.

1366
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,120
这点我都能忍
I could take that...

1367
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,950
但当他对我妈动手的时候
but when he would do it to our momma...

1368
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:14,910
你给我滚开 死女人
Get away from me, woman!

1369
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,390
够了 再也不许这样
That's enough. No more.

1370
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,920
听见了吗
Do you hear me?

1371
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,710
你他妈的开枪啊
Pull that damn trigger.

1372
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,750
不要 戴斯蒙德 住手
Don't, Desmond. Stop!

1373
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:38,550
但你并没有杀了他吗
But you didn't kill him?

1374
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,950
在我心里 已经杀了
In my heart, I did.

1375
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:06,600
所以 在那之后 我向上帝发誓
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1376
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:09,210
我绝对不会再碰枪了

玉米秆 你是在逗我吧

1627
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,520
"小子 你是在打单套结 不是做内衣"
You're tying a bowline, boy, not building a bra.

你是说塞克特 那个医护兵吗
You mean Schecter, the Medic?

1656
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:21,530
他没挺过来
He didn't make it.

1657
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:22,870
死于休克
He died of shock.

1658

我一直以为 你只是个瘦弱的孩子
All I saw was a skinny kid.

1661
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,890
我根本不了解你的为人
I didn't know who you were.

1662
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,540
你对这个国家所做出的贡献
You've done more than any other man

1663
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,800
超过了其他任何服役的军人
could've done in the service of his country.

1664
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:17,270
我这辈子 从来没有如此误解过别人
And I have never been more wrong about someone in my life.

1665

我希望有朝一日 你能原谅我

明天我们要继续攻打钢锯岭

我知道 明天是你的安息日

02:01:47,230 --> 02:01:49,790
他们很多人都不像你这样 拥有虔诚的信仰
Most of these men don't believe the same way you do.

1669
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:53,390
但他们坚信
But they believe so much

1670
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,110
你对自己信仰的虔诚
in how much you believe.

1671
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,140
你在钢锯岭上的所作所为
What you did on that Ridge

1672
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:01,630
简直堪称奇迹
is just nothing short of a miracle,

1673
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:03,560
他们也希望能享有这份奇迹
and they want a piece of it.

1674
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:09,000
如果你不去 他们是不会上去的
And they're not gonna go up there without you.

1675
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,370
上尉 你们为什么还没行动
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

1676
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,750
十分钟前 你们就该发动攻击了
You were supposed to begin that assault 10 minutes ago.

1677
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:25,180
我们还在等待 长官
We're waiting, sir.

1678
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,470
等什么
Waiting for what?

1679
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:32,050
等待道斯二等兵 为我们祈祷完毕 长官
For Private Doss to finish praying for us, sir.

1680
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,700
道斯二等兵正在为你们祈祷
Private Doss is praying for you?

1681
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:35,760
他妈的谁是道斯二等兵
Who the hell is Private Doss?

1682
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,770
准备出发
Let's go to work.

1683
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,560
跪下
Down!

1684
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:55,810
跪下 跪在地上
Get down! Get down on the ground!

1685
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,560
立刻跪下
On the ground. Now!

1686
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:39,490
躺下 快躺下 我有吗啡
Lay down! Lay down! Lay down! I got the morphine.

1687
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,720
快走 快走 快带他离开这里
Let's go! Let's go. Let's get this man outta here.

1688
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,740
快 快
Go! Go!

1689
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:49,410
我的《圣经》
My Bible...

1690
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:52,420
我的《圣经》 我的《圣经》
My Bible. My Bible...

1691
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:54,960
停 停 快停下
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1692
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:58,790
我的《圣经》 我的《圣经》
My Bible. My Bible.

1693
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,360
知道了
Okay.

1694
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,480
戴斯蒙德 你马上就能回家了
You going home, Desmond.

1695
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:19,530
我们拿下了钢锯岭
We've taken the Hacksaw.

1696
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:26,160
等等 等等 戴斯蒙德
Hold up! Hold up! Desmond.

1697
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:29,310
戴斯蒙德
Desmond.

1698
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,820
当时 我一直在祈祷
I was praying the whole time.

1699
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,790
我一直向主祈祷
I just kept praying,

1700
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:23,820
"主啊 求求你 让我再救一个吧"
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1701
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,720
每当救下一个人之后
When I got this,

1702
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:29,440
我就继续祈祷 "主啊 求你 让我再救一个吧"
I said "Lord, please help me get one more".

1703
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:37,810
在我看来
I would say anyone is wrong

1704
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:40,090
试图改变任何人的信仰 都是不明智的
to try to compromise somebody's conviction.

1705
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:43,210
不论是在军队 还是在其他地方
I don't care whether it's the army or what it is.

1706
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,530
只要你秉承自己的信仰
When you're on a conviction,

1707
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:47,490
那就绝不是玩笑
that is not a joke.

1708
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:50,900
而是真正的你
That's what you are.

1709
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:54,130
虽然我对他说了许多
Even though I said those things

1710
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:56,410
说他应该拿枪上战场
to him in regard to carrying a rifle,

1711
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,730
如果他不拿枪
then... then he would never be my...

1712
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:02,650
我就绝不会和他一起并肩作战
by my damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1713
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:05,600
但最终
But then, in the long run,

1714
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,170
我却发现 他是最英勇的士兵之一
finding out that he was one of the bravest persons alive.

1715
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:12,280
而最后 还需要他来救我
And then to have him ended up

1716
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,330
这简直太讽刺了
saving my life was the irony of the whole thing.

1717
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:21,230
鲜血从他的脸庞和眼睛上流下
Blood had ran down through to the fella's face and eyes.

1718
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:25,900
当时 他躺在那里 呻吟着 不停地叫医护兵
He was laying there just groaning and calling for a medic.

1719
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:31,450
我从水壶中倒了些水 拿了些纱布
I took the water from my canteen and got some bandages,

1720
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:33,890
帮他洗了脸
and I washed his face.

1721
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,510
当他眼里的鲜血 被擦干净之后
And when I was washing his eyes,

1722
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,310
他睁开了眼睛
his eyes came up.

1723
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:42,500
他简直高兴坏了
Man, he just lit up.

1724
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:47,050
他说 "我还以为我瞎了"
He says "I thought I was blind."

1725
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,220
而当时他脸上的笑容
And if I hadn't got anything more out of the war

1726
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,310
对我而言
than that smile he gave me,

1727
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:56,580
就是最好的回报
I wouldn't have been well repaid.
