What the hell is your delay, Captain?

We're waiting, sir.

1692
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:58,790
My Bible. My Bible.

I would say anyone is wrong
在我看來

1704
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:40,090
to try to compromise somebody's conviction.
試圖改變任何人的信仰 都是不明智的

I don't care whether it's the army or what it is.
不論是在軍隊 還是在其他地方

1706
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,530

to him in regard to carrying a rifle,

1711
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,730
then... then he would never be my...

02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:02,650
by my damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,170
finding out that he was one of the bravest persons alive.

1715
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:12,280
And then to have him ended up

1716
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,330
saving my life was the irony of the whole thing.
這簡直太諷刺了

1717

Blood had ran down through to the fella's face and eyes.

1718
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:25,900

I took the water from my canteen and got some bandages,
我從水壺中倒了些水 拿了些紗布

1720
02:10:31,650 --> 02:10:33,890
and I washed his face.
幫他洗了臉

1721
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,510
And when I was washing his eyes,

1722
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,310
his eyes came up.
他睜開了眼睛

1723
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:42,500

He says "I thought I was blind."

And if I hadn't got anything more out of the war

1726
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,310
than that smile he gave me,
對我而言

1727
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:56,580
I wouldn't have been well repaid.
就是最好的回報
