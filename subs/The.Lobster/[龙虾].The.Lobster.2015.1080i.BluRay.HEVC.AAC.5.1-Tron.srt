- 想和我们一起去走走吗 - 可以啊

154
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,040
总有一天我会坐上那游艇
One of these days gonna be me on one of those yachts

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,660
为什么
Why those yachts?

156
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,140
在你走之前会有个最后的考验
The final ordeal before letting you go

157
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,390
最难的一关
The hardest one

158
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,790
十五天的假期 情侣单独共处
15 days of vacation just a couple alone,

159
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,550
你没有看过宣传手册吗
Ddn't you read the leaflet?

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,800
我看了
I did

161
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,670
你看过约翰的腿了吗
Did you see John's leg?

162
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,290
没有
No

163
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,380
约翰 让我们看看你的腿
John, could you show your leg?

164
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,130
好吧
Oh yeah

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,460
有请187房 今天是他入住的第二天
Room 187, day 2

166
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,490
大家好
Hello everyone

167
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,040
当我父亲爱上了另一个女人的时候
My mother was left on her own

168
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
他抛弃了我的母亲
when my father fell in love with a woman...

169
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,540
只是因为她数学比我母亲好
who was better at math than she was

170
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,830
我想 她有研究生的学历
She has postgraduate degree, I think

171
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,250
然而我母亲只是个本科生
While my mother only a graduate

172
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,590
当时我十九岁
I was 19 at the time

173
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,720
我母亲来过这家酒店 但没能成功找到伴侣
My mother entered the hotel but didn't make it

174
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,780
最后变成了一只狼
and was turning into a wolf

175
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,770
我很想念她
I really miss her

176
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,040
后来我得知她被送到了一家动物园
I found out she's been moved to a zoo

177
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,350
我经常跑去看她
I often went there to see her

178
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,140
我给她喂生肉吃
I give her raw meat

179
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,400
我知道狼喜欢生肉
I knew the wolf like raw meat

180
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,420
但我不知道到底哪只狼是我的母亲
But I couldn't figure out which of the wolves was my mother

181
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,000
所以我会给每只狼都喂一点
So I used to give a little bit to each of them

182
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,720
有天 我决定闯入围栏
One day I decided to enter the enclosure

183
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,450
因为我真的很想念她 想拥抱她
I really missed her and I wanted a hug

184
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,730
我翻过并跳进了围栏
I climbed the fence and jumped in

185
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,620
群狼立即朝我冲来  围攻我
All the wolves charged at once and attacked me

186
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,910
只有两只狼纹丝不动
All but two stood motionless

187
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,110
于是我推断 其中一头必是我母亲
I guess one of those two must be my mother

188
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,290
动物园的警卫迅速地救了我 把我送去了医院
The zoo guard got to me quite quickly and took me to the hospital

189
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,150
谢天谢地 我保住了我的腿
Thankfully I didn't lose my leg

190
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,320
只是有些瘸而已
I just had this limp

191
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
这也随之成为了我的标志性特征
Which also is my defining characteristic

192
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,570
我的妻子在六天前去世了
My wife died six days ago

193
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,720
她很漂亮 我也很爱她
She was very beautiful and I love her very much

194
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,990
她也有些瘸
She had limp too

195
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,560
谢谢 约翰 回到自己的座位上吧
Thank you John, you can return to you seat

196
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,100

但我感到自己成功的融入了这个大家庭

我的标志性特征是 我有着美丽的笑容

201

# 有东西抓住了我的心 #

202
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,250
# 让我疯狂 让我神志不清 #
#Keeping my soul and my senses apart#

203
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,070
# 有东西闯入了我的生活 #

204
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,960
你有和别人跳过舞吗

205
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,210

206

跳的是什么类型舞呢
What sort of dancing you should do?

209
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,140
这根据音乐而定
Just depends on the music

210
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
你要坐下来吗
Do you need to sit down?

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,640
不 不 我打算去跳舞
No, no, I'm getting ready to dance

我来给你介绍下我的好朋友
Let me introduce you to my best friend

216
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,250
刚才和你聊天那个女人是个很冷漠的人
That woman you were talking to have no feeling whatsoever

217
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,960
她对什么都不感兴趣
She feels nothing at all

218
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,680
她是酒店里最好的猎手
She's the best hunter in hotel

219
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,420
悄无声息 却身手敏捷

225
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,950
# 我想知道这是否真实 #

很抱歉 我把血滴到了你的衬衫上

但别担心 去掉血渍的方法有很多
But don't worry, there are many ways to remove blood stain from clothing

一种方法是把衣服用冷水拧干

241
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,630
但千万别用温水去洗血渍

好的

# 但你朝我走来 #

# 一种莫名的感觉涌上心头 #

- 我腿有点痛 - 没关系 去吧

等你好些的时候告诉我 我们能继续跳
But let me know when you feel better, and we can dance again

252
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,240
# 让我疯狂 让我失去了理智 #
Keeping my soul and my senses apart

253
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,830
# 有东西侵入了我的夜晚 #
#Something has invaded my light#

254
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,050

我真希望我的腿没有瘸

我曾今很擅长跑步 但现在不太可能了
I used to good at running, but not anymore

264

我很确信我会比其他人慢
I'm sure would be slower than them

265
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,560
如果我是你 我会想些别的致胜技巧
If I were you, I think of some trick that choose element of surprise...

266
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,910
而不是靠速度取胜
instead of speed

267
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,940
你说得对
You're right

268
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,020
我应该如此
That's what I would do

269
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,130
# 在你还爱我的时候回头 #
#Back when you loved me#

270
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,740
# 有天早上你问过我 #
#You asked me one morning while we were talking#

271
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,550
# 生活是什么 #
#"what was life about?"#

272
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,580
# 我对你说 对有些人来说生活是酒 #

# 对有些人来说 生活是荣耀 #

274

# 对有些人来说 生活是为了致富 #
#for some it's being rich#

275
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,860
# 但对我来说 你才是我生活的意义 #

276

# 对有些人来说 生活是荣耀 #

# 对有些人来说 生活是为了致富 #

278
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,130

279

# 你还是想知道生活的意义 #
#You still wonder what they're saying#

282
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,950
# 我的心很痛 #
#How my own heart beats#

283
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,360
# 是否还有像我这样的人存在 #
#Are there perhaps more people like me exist#

284
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,560
# 心早已心如死灰 #
#Dead on the inside#

285

请脱掉你的裤子 坐在床上

我知道 但恐怕我们必须做

我想您应该知道 在这个酒店内的任何地方
I imagine you know masturbation is not permitted

313
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,630
自慰都是被严令禁止的吧
in the room or any other area of the hotel

314
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,200
是的
Yes

315
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,330
但是 我发现您还是有自慰的行为

一个在乡间骑马的裸女
A naked woman on a horse in the country

324
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,790
如果我是你
If I were in your shoes

325
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,500
我不会注意看那个裸女 而是会注意那匹马
I would not be ogling the naked woman but the horse.

326
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,160
我敢说 那匹马也曾经和你一样
I'm sure that horse's once a weak and cowardly man...

327
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,410
是个懦夫

328
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,470
女人独自走路时

那只是个意外 我只是有点昏头了
It was a accident, I just got carried away.

332
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,150
没有这个必要
This is not necessary.

333
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,610
请把手放在面包机上

339
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,970
女人和男人一起走路
Woman walks with man.

340
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,110
一旦你进入那个房间
What they do as soon as you enter the room...

341
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,430
会先把你的全身彻底清洗一遍
is to wash you body and your head really well.

342
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,140
你怎么知道
How did you know?

343
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,400
我叔叔曾经认识这里的一名服务生
My uncle used to know a waiter who worked here.

344
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,020
服务生怎么会知道流程
The waiter know the procedure?

345
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
他们是不被允许进入那个房间的
They are not allow to inside that room.

346
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,020
不管怎样 接下来他们会剥去你的皮
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin...

347
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,920
经过水洗和肥皂之后 皮肤已经变软了

348
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,620
之后 他们会用激光或手术刀摘除心脏 眼球
Afterward they remove the heart, the eyes and other vital organs of the body...

349
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,020
以及其它重要器官

350
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,830
根据所选的动物不同 之后的流程也不尽相同
Then the procedure changes according to the animal one has choosen.

351
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,920
你说的很有道理
That makes total sense.

352
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,450
我猜测 比如哺乳动物和飞禽的步骤
I mean I suppose mammals demand different kind of work than...

353
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,590
- 就会大不相同 - 的确
- fowl, for example. - Exactly.

354
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,940
之后他们会把尸体残骸

扔在酒店餐厅外面

356
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,820
血液则供给市里的医院

357
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,460
为什么
Why is that?

358
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,930
这些血液可以供给献血不足的地区做手术
The blood is used for surgery where there aren't blood donor available.

359
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,680
- 昨天有新人入住 - 我看到了
- New guests arrived yesterday. - Yes I saw them.

360
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,280
我好像看到了一个瘸腿的女人
I think I saw a woman with limp.

361
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,880
她只是扭伤了脚踝
It is just sprained ankle.

362
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,260
几天之后 她就会恢复正常了
She would be walking normally again after a few days.

363
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,720
真可惜
That's a shame.

364
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,270
的确很可惜
It's a shame indeed.

365

他坐在那个喜欢奶油饼干的女人身边
he sat next to woman who like butter biscuit.

367
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,620
他盯着窗外 不是为了看什么
He gazed out of the window, not looking at anything in particular.

368
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,280
只是为了避免跟她交谈
Just trying avoid talking to her.

369
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,970
- 鲍勃怎么样 - 它没事
- How is Bob? - He is fine.

370
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,580
我真想和你与鲍勃一起在午后散步
Give anything to go for a walk with you and Bob one afternoon.

371
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,070
恐怕狗不能外出 这是规定
The dogs are not allow. There's a rule, I'm afraid.

372
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,340
他想 "总有些让人无法反驳的借口"
"There are some excuses no one can't argue with", he thought.

373
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,530
毋庸置疑 借口有好坏之分
Some excuses without a doubt better than others.

374
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,680
而刚才那个借口就很好
That was really good one.

375
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,090
这些饼干是给鲍勃的
These biscuits are for Bob.

376
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,580
如果你想奖励它 可以把这个给它

377
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,800
- 告诉它这是我送的 - 谢谢

378
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,960
什么时候我能去你房间聊天吗

379
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,890
我可以给你吹箫

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,450
吹箫时我总会吞下去的

382
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,730
如果你喜欢肛交也绝对没问题

383
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,050
我的前夫总是说

384
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,680
我的身材是他见过最好的 但还是不说他了
I have the most beautiful size he's ever see, but let's not talk about him.

385

我的房间号是180 所以分机号也是180
My room number is 180, so my telephone extension is 180.

如果我不能很快找到合适的伴侣

她说道

00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,410
就会从某个房间的窗户上跳下去自杀

也许是320房间

402
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,320
或者更高点 480房间 这样更合适

403
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,660
她说完后

他茫然地盯着她 无言以对

接着他看向森林 再一次想到

不如你也变成鹦鹉吧 我们就有伴了

自己有语言障碍
Picking one of few animals that can talk...

就算变成动物 你也还是口齿不清

至于你 他们会抓住你

你们俩真是太可悲了

男人蛙泳时不应该穿泳裤

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,970
现在流出来了
Yes.

451
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,710
- 给我点纸巾好吗 - 好的
- Can I use the tissue? - Yes.

452
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,600
我想问你一个问题 希望你能诚恳地回答
Can I ask you a question, I want you to answer me honestly.

453
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,220
哪一种情况更糟 是在森林里饥寒交迫而死
What's worse? to die of cold and hunger in the woods?

454
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,570
还是变成动物之后被天敌吃掉或者杀掉
To become a animal would be killed or eaten by some big animal?

455
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,150
或者还是时不时的流鼻血
Or have nose bleed from time to time?

456
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,860
变成动物之后被天敌吃掉或者杀掉 这更糟糕
To become a animal would be killed or eaten by some big animal.

457
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,110
没错
Exactly.

458
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,700
- 她没有怀疑你在作假吗 - 没有
- She isn't suspect you're lying? - No.

459
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,830
我很高兴 因为一对新情侣产生了
I'm very happy because we have a new couple.

460
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,320
他们于两天前相识

但现在已经深爱彼此 琴瑟相谐

他们的鼻子都有同样的问题

463
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,810
会突然流鼻血
They bleed quite suddenly.

464
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,710
明天他们会换到双人间
Tomorrow they will be transfer to a double room...

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,560
他们会在双人间里住两周

之后会换到游艇上 再住两周

469
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,470
最终以情侣的身份返回城市

470
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,020
- 我觉得非常幸福 - 我也是

471

我们的员工以及我本人将会密切监视

474
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,580
如果你们遇到了任何不能自行解决
If you encounter any problems, any tensions, any arguing...

475
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,240
问题 矛盾 或是争吵

476
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,490
我们会分配给你们孩子
You would be asign children.

477
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,430
通常那样就会解决很多问题
That usually helps a lot.

478
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,180
早上好
Good morning.

479
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:02,850
101房间 剩余七天
Room 101, 7 days left.

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,970
你的头发真好看
You have really nice hair.

482
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,220
我知道
I know.

483
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,230
你看
Look.

484
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,780
那你喜欢我的头发吗
How do you like mine?

485
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
我感觉你的发质有点干燥
I think yours quite dry hair.

486
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,750
颜色倒是不错
Color is ok though.

487
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,820
最重要的是你没有谢顶
The most important thing is that you're not bald.

488
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,790
可惜对于男人 谢顶总是不可避免
However when comes to men, bald is always the possibility you can't avoid.

489
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,170
- 你父亲谢顶了吗 - 他没有
- ls your father bald? - No he isn't.

490
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,360
即便哪天我秃顶了
And even if somedays I lose my hair,

491
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,670
也有办法让头发再生的
there are things I can do to get my hair back.

492
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,170
我可以去植发
I can have a hair transplant.

493
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,020
植发的人一眼就能被看穿
You always can tell someone had a hair transplant.

494
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,600
- 我知道 - 好头发并非人人都能拥有
- I know. - Nice hair is not something you can get

495
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,440
这是与生俱来的
It's something you born with.

496
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,690
你父亲没有谢顶 并不代表你就能松口气了
The fact your father isn't bald shouldn't put you at ease.

497
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,630
你想好最后一天会做什么了吗
Have you decided what you're going to do in your last day?

498
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,820
我还在考虑
I'm still thinking about it.

499
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,150
早上好 女士们
Morning ladies.

500
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,640
今天是你的最后一天
So, today is your last day.

501
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,560
按照惯例 你可以选择
And as the customary, you can choose...

502
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,300
如何度过最后一晚
how you like to spend your last night.

503
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,050
在这种情况下我都会建议你选择
What I always said in this situation is it would

504
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,660
变成动物后不能做到的事情
be wise to do something you can't do as animal.

505
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,280
例如读一部经典文学
For example read a work of classic literature...

506
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,220
或者唱一曲喜欢的歌
or sing a song you really like.

507
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,290
选择下面的这些事情就太傻了
It would be silly to choose...

508
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,050
比如 去野外散步
for example, a walking the ground...

509
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,200
或者和别人做爱
or have sex intercourse with another person,

510
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,340
这些变成动物后也能做的
those are things you can do as animal.

511
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,780
但首先 你最好的朋友有点东西
But first, your best friend is reading something...

512
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,870
她想和你分享 这真是太感人
she like to read you, it's really very touching.

513
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,530
在学校时我们总是坐在一起
We always sat together at school...

514
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,000
每当我有了麻烦
and whenever I had a problem...

515
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,930
我都向你倾诉 因为你总能给出最好的建议
I told you about it because you always give the best advice.

516
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,230
当我们在学校舞会上
When we didn't manage to find...

517
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,640
没能找到舞伴的时候
dance partner at the school prom,

518
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,830
我们患难与共 这给予我力量
The fact we were together at that difficult moment give me strength.

519
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,000
我很抱歉事情到了现在的局面
I'm sorry things come to this.

520
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,240
我确信如果能再多给你几天
I'm sure if you have a few more days

521
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,820
你一定能像我样找到伴侣
you would find someone just like I did,

522
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,420
因为你是如此可爱
because you're a adorable person...

523
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,380
拥有美丽的秀发和清新的口气
and you have very beautiful hair and very nice breath.

524
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,220
我一直很嫉妒你的秀发
I'm always jealous of your hair...

525
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,180
你知道的
you know that.

526
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,780
不论过去 现在 还是将来
You were, are, and always

527
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,900
你都是我最好的朋友
will be my best friend

528
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,250
我会时常想念你 我会永远带着生日时
And I'll think of you often, and I'll always wear those silver earing...

529
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,170
你送我的银耳环
you give me for my birthday

530
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,750
我会想你的
I'll miss you

531
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,950
无论我将来回到城市里
And However many new girl friends I make in a few days...

532
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,400
会结交多少新闺蜜
when I move back into the city,

533
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,870
我都不会再找到你这样真实...
I don't think I'll find another as true...

534
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,910
我想独自看那部电影"伴我同行"
I like to ask for the film "Stand By Me"...

535
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,190
由瑞凡・菲尼克斯 基弗・萨瑟兰
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland...

536
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,270
和理查德・德莱福斯主演的那部
and Richard Dreyfuss, alone.

537
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,790
明智的选择
Excellent choice.

538
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,200
很不错的电影
Lovely film.

请留言
Please leave a message

540
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,200
你好
Hello

541
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,590
你可能在浴室吧 所以听不到电话响
You're probably in the bathroom, that's why you can't hear phone ring.

542
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,280
早上洗个冷水澡真是再舒服不过了
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

543
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,350
等你洗完澡我再打给你
Well, I'll call you a little bit later after you finish your shower.

544
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,130
稍后再聊
We'll talk later.

545
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,210
再见
Bye.

546
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,260
一天 当他打高尔夫球时
One day, as he was playing golf,

547
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,990
他意识到 没有情感时却装作感情充沛
he thought that it is more difficult to pretend

548
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
要比有情感时装作冷漠无情
you do have feelings when you don't...

549
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,080
要更为艰难
than to pretend you don't have feelings when you do.

550
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,440
他也想到 他其实喜欢她的口音
He also thought that he like her accent.

551
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,700
而且他总是偏爱短发女人
and he always prefer woman with short hair.

552
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,570
于是他认定她就是自己要找的伴侣
So he decided she was the one.

553
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,080
捕猎时 他会跟着她
During the hunt, he would followed her.

554
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,850
一旦她击中了某个独身者 他就会对她说
And as soon as she shot a loner, he would said to her:

555
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,780
"真希望我们用的是真枪
"I wish we have real gun...

556
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,220
而非这些愚蠢的麻醉枪
instead of this silly tranquilizer one...

557
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,130
不如你徒手杀了他吧"
why don't you kill him with your bare hands?"

558
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,140
当她掐住独身者的喉咙时
And the moment she put her hand around loner's throat,

559
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,390
他就会说
He would said:

560
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,890
"希望他能马上死去"
"I hope him die right the way".

561
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,910
出什么事了
What happened?

562
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,950
她从180房间的窗户上跳了下去
She jumped from the window of room 180.

563
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,840
到处都是血迹和饼干
There are bloods and biscuits everywhere.

564
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,390
希望她能马上死去
I hope she die right the way.

565
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:57,000
转念一想 我还是希望她能在死前多受点折磨
On second thought, I hope she suffers quite a bit before she dies

566
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,820
我只希望在我的房间里
I just hope her pathetic scream...

567
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,410
听不到她可悲的嘶喊
can't be heard from my room.

568
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,030
因为我正想休息一会儿 需要安宁
Because I was thinking about having a lie down and I need peace and quiet.

569
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,800
我刚打完高尔夫 很累了
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.

570
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,130
我可不希望听到一个女人死前还不停地哭嚎
The last thing I need is some woman dying slowly and loudly.

571
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,000
她喊的这么大声 我听不到你说什么
I can't hear you with all this screaming.

572
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,740
我们另找个安静的时间再聊吧
We'll talk some other time when it's quieter.

573
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,680
再见
Good bye.

574
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,770
再见
Good bye.

587

你通常睡在床的左边还是右边
Do you normally sleep on the left side of the bed or the right?

588
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,420
- 右边 你呢 - 左边 太好了
- The right, you? - The left, perfect

589
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,370
打开双腿
Spread your legs.

590
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,460
需要我关灯吗 还是你想读会书
Should I shut off the light or would you like to read?

591
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,750
- 我想读书 灯光会影响你吗 - 不会
- I'd like to read, does light bother you? - No

592
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,100
我睡觉不会受灯光和噪声的影响
I'm not bothered by light or noise.

593
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,200
我睡觉很沉
I'm deep sleeper.

594
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,300
- 你们好 - 你们好
- Hello. - Hello.

595
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,850
- 恭喜你们 - 谢谢
- Congratulation. - Thank you.

00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,380
这是我们的新女儿 名叫伊丽莎白
This is our new daughter, her name is Elizabeth.

597
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,240
伊丽莎白 快去亲亲叔叔 他是我的朋友
Elizabeth, give this nice man a kiss, he is a friend of mine.

598
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,260
我最不喜欢就是傻姑娘的亲吻
The last thing I want right now is a kiss from silly little girl.

599
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,390
拜托 你知道的
Come on, you know.

600
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,060
哭什么 你应该感谢我 伊丽莎白
Don't cry, you should thank me, Elizabeth.

601
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,060
现在你的腿瘸了 更像你爸爸了
Now you have a limp and would be more like your father.

602
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,330
那个声音是什么
What was that sound?

603
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,090
你说什么了吗
Did you say something?

604
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,050
没有
No.

605
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,930
介意换个姿势吗 好让我看着你的脸
Do you mind if we fuck in a position where I can see your face?

606
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,130
好的
Sure.

607
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,690
打开灯吧 这样我才可以看到你
Turn the light on please,so I can see you better.

608
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,980
早安
Good morning.

609
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,060
早安
Good morning.

610
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,780
我杀了你的兄弟
I killed your bother.

611
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,890
让他慢慢死去
I left him to die very slowly.

612
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,250
我们说话的时候 他可能还没死透
He may not be dead yet as now we speak.

613
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,900
我踢了他很久
I was kicking him for ages.

614
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,150
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

615
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,750
他发出了奇怪的哀号声 像这样
He whined a little the strangest kind of bark, something like this.

616
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,550
他一定很痛苦
Must have been from pain.

617
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,970
- 你什么也没有听到吗 - 没有
- You didn't hear anything? - No.

618
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,340
你的确睡得很沉
You really are deep sleeper.

619
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,760
- 你想喝咖啡吗 - 太好了
- Would you like some coffee? - I love some

620
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,760
等我刷牙洗脸完后
As soon as I wash my face and brush my teeth.

621
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,990
我等不及想听 昨晚你答应要讲给的故事了
I can't wait to hear that story you promise to tell me last night...

622
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,560
关于大学里你的那个学生
about that student of yours in the university,

623
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,720
以及他糟糕的期末项目
and his awful final project.

624
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,790
这个故事确实很有趣
It's really very funny story.

625
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,110
那个学生叫瑞斯
His name is Ryess.

626
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,780
祥瑞的瑞 宙斯的斯 瑞斯
R-y-e-s-s, Ryess.

627
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,660
这不是眼泪 只是水滴 我刚才在洗脸
It is not tear, just water, I just washed my face.

628
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,520
我就知道你在撒谎
I knew you were lying.

629
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,070
我不明白你为什么这样做
I can't understand why you did it.

630
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,320
所有人都清楚
When you know as anyone...

631
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,910
情侣关系是不能建立在谎言之上
that relationship can not be built on the lie.

632
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,150
我们马上去见酒店经理 你会得到应有的惩罚
We're going to the hotel manager right now, and you'll get the punishment you deserve.

633
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,850
这会受到什么惩罚
What's the punishment for this?

634
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,470
他们会把你变成没人想变成的动物
They turn you into animal no one wants to be.

635
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,520
我看到你的伴侣从那条路走了
I saw you partner went back that way.

636
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,820
他看起来很慌乱
He looked frantic.

637
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,580
一切都还好吗
Is everything ok?

638
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,420
起初他想让她在受尽折磨而死
At first he wanted to kill her in some horrible and painful way...

639
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,270
就像她对他兄弟做的那样
like the death she inflicted on his brother.

640
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,290
他考虑过不停地踢她的胃部
He thought about kicking her in the stomach over and over again.

641
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,970
然后在同样部位再捅上几刀
And then stabbing her in the same spot in the stomach.

642
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,930
但他又觉得这是徒劳 因为她已经不省人事了
Then he thought there wouldn't be much point because she's already unconscious...

643
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,340
感觉不到踢打或者刀插的痛苦
and wouldn't feel any pain from the kick or the knife.

644
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,620
你也得向我开一枪
You have to shoot me,

645
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,490
这样他们就不会怀疑我帮了你
so they don't suspect I helped you.

646
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,350
一名酒店服女佣帮了他
A hotel maid helped him.

647
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,930
他不知道为什么她要这么做
He couldn't understand why she did it

648
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,470
他决定把她转化为一只动物
So he decided to turn her into a animal

649
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,970
他把她拖进了变形室
He dragged her to the room with transformation took place

650
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,460
我问过他很多次 他究竟把她变成了什么动物
I asked him many times what sorts of animal he turn her into

651
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,160
但他总是用同样的答案回答我
But he always give me the same answer

652
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,990
"这跟你无关"
"That's none of your concern"

653
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,120
那晚他离开了酒店
That night he left the hotel...

654
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,150
彻底地离开了
once and for all

655
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,180
他开始漫无目的地跑着
He began to run without knowing where he was headed

656
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,830
但其实他是朝我们跑来的
But he was headed towards us

657
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,940
这是他新生命的起点
This was the start of his new life

658
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,340
那时候 他还不知道孤独是多么痛苦
Back then, he didn't know how much it hurts to be alone

659
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,170
也不知道当背部一直疼痛难忍
How much it hurts when you can not reach to rub pain relieve ointment on your back

660
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,750
却无法自己上药的痛苦
And you're constantly in pain

661
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,130
在森林里找到的他 是从酒店逃出来的
Find him in the woods, he escaped from hotel

662
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,760
你是医生吗
Are you a doctor by any chance?

663
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,010
不是
No

664
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,650
真可惜
That's a pity

665
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,010
我们这里需要一名医生
We need a doctor around

666
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,600
我们曾有过名医生 但他们几个月前抓住了他
We had one, but they caught him a couple of months ago

667
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,410
我是一名建筑师
I'm a architect

668
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,340
那也不错 欢迎加入
That's ok, so welcome

669
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,430
只要你愿意 你可以一直和我们待在一起
You can stay with us for as long as you like

670
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,620
你可以到死都是个独身者 没有时间限制
You can be a loner until the day you die, there is no time limit

671
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,020
非常感谢
Thank you very much

672
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,930
不过 在独身者与独身者之间
Anyway, any romantic or sexual relations...

673
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,410
任何感情或是性关系都是不允许的
between loners are not permitted

674
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,340
任何相关的举措都会被严惩 清楚了吗
And any such acts are punished, is that clear?

675
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,870
我能和别人聊天吗
Can I have a converstation with someone?

676
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,960
当然可以 只要不含调情或类似的含义就行
Of course you can, so long as there is no flirting or anything like that

677
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,890
舞蹈之夜也是一样
That apply to dance nights as well

678
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,760
我们都独自跳舞
We all dance by ourselves

679
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,410
所以我们只放电子音乐
That's why we only play electronic music

680
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,620
你的嘴怎么了
What happened to you mouth

681
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,830
他不能说话 他正在受血吻之刑
He can't speak, he's getting the red kiss

682
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,380
什么是血吻之刑
What's the red kiss?

683
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,310
我们用刀片割掉了他的嘴唇
We slash his lips with razor

684
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,680
以及另一个独身者的嘴唇
and lips of another loner,

685
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,860
然后强迫他们接吻
then force them to kiss each other

686
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,220
几天前的事了
That was couple of days ago now

687
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,080
但是伤口很深 所以他们还处在痛苦中
But the cuts are deep, so they're still in pain

688
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,660
你要知道 他们当时调情来着
They were flirting, you know

689
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,110
惩罚也有好坏之分
Some punishments are worse than other punishments

690
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,630
被切掉拇指可比剃光头要糟糕多了
Having your thumb cut is worse than having you head shaved

691
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,820
在腋窝底下放一颗滚烫的鸡蛋
And having a hot boiled egg under you arm pit...

692
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,060
要比在腿上踢几下更惨
is worse than having you leg kicked

693
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,330
我害怕的惩罚 并不是血吻之刑 而是另一个
The punishment I'm afraid of isn't the red kiss but another one

694
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,460
名叫 血交之刑
It is called the red intercourse

695
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,690
我从来没见过那事发生
I have never seen it happened

696
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,570
但从字面上就能轻易推断出其含义
But it's not difficult to imagine what it is means

697
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,200
我的天哪 我真的很害怕
Oh my God, I'm so afraid of it

698
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,400
跑
Move

699
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,450
躲
Hide

700
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,570
跑
Move

701
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,630
躲
Hide

702
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,560
那是我第一次见到他
That was the first time I saw him

703
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,720
他躲在我身旁一棵树后
He was hiding behind a tree close to mine

704
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,430
他看起来很体面
He seems quite presentable

705
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,090
第二天 在城里
The next day, in the city

706
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:19,980
他发现我也是近视眼
He found out that I was shortsighted too

707
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:28,710
那晚在我的梦中 我梦到...
That night in my sleep, I dreamed...

708
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,940
我们同居于城中的一栋大房子里
we lived in a big house together in the city...

709
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,000
房子里有宽敞明亮的厨房
with large and well lit kitchen

710
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,190
我穿着深蓝色的裤子
And I was wearing dark blue trousers...

711
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,030
和紧身的绿色衬衫
and tight green blouse

712
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,230
然后他脱下了我的衣服 跟我做爱
And he took my clothes off and fuck me up the ass

713
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,900
我们正做着的时候 一个歹徒闯进了厨房
And as he was fucking me, a thug came into the kitchen...

714
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,540
从第二个抽屉里拿出了牛排刀
and took the steak knife from the second drawer...

715
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,470
袭击了我们 把刀子捅进了我们的肚子里
and attacked us, stabbing the knife into our belly...

716
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,270
一刀又一刀
one by one

717
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,090
我从噩梦中惊醒
I woke up terrified

718
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,700
再努力些
Try harder

719
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,430
不要放弃 你知道你该更小心些
Don't give up, you know you should've been more careful

720
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,410
再努力一点 不然他们就会发现你
Try harder, or they'll find you...

721
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,060
你就会被变成动物 一只弱小的动物
and you would be turning into a animal, a weak one

722
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,670
我们现在必须得走了
We must get to move on now

723
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,510
待在这实在是太危险了
It's really too dangerous to stay here

724
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,770
如果你能想办法摆脱枷锁 尽力跑 来找我们
If you manage to free yourself, run as fast as you can, and come find us

725
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:29,900
如果你能摆脱枷锁
If you manage to free yourself,

726
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,660
但觉得自己可能会失血过多而死
but think you'll die from bleeding

727
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,200
那就直接去你的坟墓吧
Go straight to your grave

728
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,650
你挖好自己的坟墓了吗
Have you dug your own grave?

729
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,960
- 挖好了 - 很好
- Yes - Very good

730
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,360
就说到这里
That's enough for now

731
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,690
我要去找松露了
I'm going to go hunting for truffles

732
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,690
他们美味而且稀有
They are delicious and quite rare

733
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,350
一千克能换很多钱
A kilo can fetch a lot of money

734
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,590
那你需要带上一头猪
You're going to need a pig

735
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,230
不然很难找到松露
they are impossible to find out otherwise

736
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,470
- 我知道 - 别去太久
- I know - Don't be long

737
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,440
五十分钟之内 就能采回来
Gonna get them back in 50 minutes

738
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,810
- 你好 大卫 - 你好 罗伯特
- Hello David - Hello Robert

739
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,870
- 你对那个女人好残忍 - 她杀了我的哥哥
- What you did to that woman is dreadful - She killed my brother

740
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,930
如果她杀了你 我也会那么做的
I would've done the same thing if she killed you

741
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,310
你 你对我来说就像兄弟一样
You, you're like a brother to me

742
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,970
你是这个世界上我最好的朋友了
Oh you're my best friend of the whole world

743
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,940
我可不觉得 我是你最好的朋友
I don't think I'm your best friend of the whole world

Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave for you or to carry your corpse

976
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,320
甚至在你尸体上撒些土都别想
Or throw some dirts over you,

977
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,260
现实就是这样
that's about it

978
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,820

然而 我不知道现在还能不能吃东西

986
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,780
能请你帮我看看吗 亲爱的"

987
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,280
"好的 当然 没问题" 他说

1033
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:49,310
因为我们要同时按下播放键
as we both have to press play at the exactly the same time

1034
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,770
我们为什么不共用一副耳机呢

1035

因为这才是训练的重点

We developed a code that we can communicate with each other...

1045
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,400
既是他人在场 他们也不会知道我们在说什么
even in front of the others without them knowing what we're saying

1046
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,980

When we turn our heads to the left, it means...

1047
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,490
"我爱你胜过世间一切"
"I love you more than anything in the world"

1048
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:26,190
当我们把头向右转 意思是...
When we turn our heads to the right, it means...

1049
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,250
"小心 我们有危险"
"Watch out, we're in danger"

1050
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,310
刚开始我们要非常小心 以免弄混
We have to be very careful in the beginning not to mix up

1051
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:35,290
"我爱你胜过世间一切"
"I love you more than anything in the world"...

1052
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,020
和"小心 我们有危险"
with "watch out, we're in danger"

1053
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:41,890
当我们举起左臂 意思是...
When we raise out left arm, it means...

1054
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,320
"我想在你怀里跳舞"
"I want to dance in you arm"

1055
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,840
当我们握拳 并置于身后
When we make a fist and put it behind our back

1056
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,110
意思是 "我们做爱吧"
It means "Let's fuck"

1057
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,320
随着时间的推移 暗号越来越多
The code grew, and grew as the time went by

1058
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,680
几周后 我们不需要开口
And within a few weeks, we could talk about almost anything...

1059
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,590
就几乎能交流任何事情
without even opening our mouths

1060
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,210
停下来
Stop it

1061
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:29,590
够了 请尊重一下我的父母
That's enough, show my parents some respect

1062
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,170
他们在为你们演奏
They're playing you music

1063
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,710
没关系的
That's ok

1064
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,520
不 妈妈 这样不行
No mother, that's not ok

1065
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,590
请继续
Please continue

1066
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:41,810
你希望我弹奏同一曲 还是换一曲
Do you want me to play same piece or something else

1067
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,130
换一曲吧
Something else

1068
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,260
她父母演奏得十分美妙动听 不是吗
Didn't her parents play beautifully?

1069
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:15,170
的确是 很美妙
Yes they did, it was wonderful

1070
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:24,150
我们彼此相爱 而且我们很般配
We love each other, and we suit each other

1071
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,870
这就是为什么我们决定离开树林
And that's the reason why we decide to leave the woods...

1072
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:29,200
去城里共度余生
and stay together forever in the city

1073
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,860
明天 捕猎时 我们会消失
tomorrow, during the hunt, we're going to disappear...

1074
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,240
大家都会以为我们被抓走了
and everyone would think we been captured

1075
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:48,670
然后我们会被改造成狗或者金丝雀什么的
And then we're going to turn into dogs or canary something

1076
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,250
到了城里 我想做的第一件事是
I think the first thing I'm going to do when I get into the city...

1077
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,530
买件浴袍
is buy a bathrobe

1078
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:10,550
然后我们去泳池 跳水板很高
And then we're going to a pool with high diving board...

1079
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:11,800
非常适合跳水的那种
perfect for diving

1080
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,280
我们还要一起做很多事 正经的事 不是蠢事
And then we do lots of different things together, serious thing, not silly one...

1081
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:20,370
比如在公园里散步 或是一起弹吉他...
like go for a walk in the park or play the guitar together...

1082
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:22,230
只写到这里
It stops there

1083
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,920
后面还有笔记 但我觉得不重要
There's notes at the back, but I don't think it's important

1084
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,170
读读笔记
Read the notes

1085
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,170
波托菲诺 意大利渔村

1091
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,220
你在哪找到这笔记的
Where did you find that?

1092
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,200
在河边
By the river

1093
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,420
有人在捕猎的时候弄丢的
Someone must've dropped it during the hunt

1094
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,340
交给我
Give it to me

1095
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,750
我来处理
I'll take care of it

1096
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:10,720
知道为什么今天我带你来这么僻静的地方吗
Can you imagine why I brought you to such quiet place today?

1097
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:18,820
不知道
No

1098
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,680
因为我觉得 这是个适合安葬你的好地方
Because I think it's the perfect spot for your grave

1099
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,520
现在用土盖住自己
Now cover yourself with soil

1100
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,390
用手
Use your hands

1101
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,380
把脸也盖上
Over your face too

1102
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:34,440
你不想让脸被狗吃了 对吧
You wouldn't want your face to get eaten by dogs, would you?

1103
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,110
如果你比我早死
If you die before me,

1104
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:05,150
我会尽我所能多来看望你 我保证
I'll visit you as often as I can, I promise

1105
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:19,210
我觉得我们现在该走了
I think we should leave right now

1106
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:22,950
我们三个来到这里...
The three of us coming here...

1107
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:26,530
而不是两个或者四个 这很危险
in stead of two or four is very dangerous

1108
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,050
我们之前怎么没想到呢
How didn't we think it early

1109
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,890
医生很有可能会怀疑我们
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us

1110
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:38,660
我建议一有机会就逃走
I suggest that we leave the first chance we get

1111
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:41,300
事实上 现在就是个机会
Right now in the fact

1112
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,770
别害怕
Don't be afraid

1113
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,840
不会有人怀疑的
No one will suspect a thing

1114
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,350
我猜你没料到会有这样的惊喜
I bet you aren't expecting the surprise

1115
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,910
- 不是很好吗 - 是的
- Isn't it wonderful? - Yes, it is

1116
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:59,080
但我还是想多考虑几天...
Still I'd like a few days just to think it over so that...

1117
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:02,470
我可以等到...
I could maybe have the surgery...

1118
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:05,480
下次来城里再做手术
when next time come to the city?

1119
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:09,350
还有什么需要考虑的呢
What is that to think about?

1120
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,190
看得清楚和近视相比哪个更好 还需要考虑吗
It's better to see clearly, or to be short-sighted? is that it?

1121
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,300
这很荒谬 你懂的
That's absurd, you know that

1122
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,630
而且 这是最好的眼科医生
Anyway, this doctor is the best there is

1123
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:21,590
非常难预约的
And it's very difficult to get a appointment

1124
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,590
我几个月前打电话 才能约到今天
I called him months ago to get him to see you today

1125
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:17,260
- 她瞎了 - 谢谢
- She's blind - Thank you

1126
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,770
放下你的刀 站起来
Throw down your knife and stand up

1127
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,250
你为什么要弄瞎我
Why did you have to blind me?

1128
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,230
你本可以弄瞎他的
You could have blinded him?

1129
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,690
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about

1130
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:58,270
药物让你神志不清
The drugs are messing with you head

1131
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:02,130
如果我是你 我会更勇敢地面对整件事情
If I were you, I would try and be a little braver about the whole thing

1132
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,650
现在起来 把刀给我
And now get up and give me your knife

1133
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,810
不然我会打倒你 把刀抢过来
Or I'll hit you and take it by force

1134
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:09,530
我来了
Here I come

1135
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,900
我发誓要杀了你
I swear I'll kill you

1136
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:24,820
放开我的头发
Let go of my hair

1137
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,310
你弄疼我了
You're hurting me

1138
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,990
想想看 如果有人瞎了
Just think that when someone goes blind

1139
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:54,000
其他感知能力会更敏锐
One of other senses is heightened

1140
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:33,040
你也可以在树林里抓只狗 训练他做导盲犬
You could also capture a dog in the woods, and train him to guide you

1141
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,730
狗可以做到的 知道吗
Dogs can do that, you know?

1142
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,780
我会亲自帮你抓狗的
I'll help you catch a dog myself

1143
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:43,220
现在冷静点 不然我会把你丢在这
Now calm down, or I'm going to leave you here...

1144
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,710
我觉得你靠自己是找不到二号碰头点的
and I don't think you'll manage to find meeting of two on your own

1145
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,490
你喜欢这景色吗
Are you enjoying the view

1146
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:04,280
当然
Sure

1147
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,750
你的手怎么了
What happened to your hand?

1148
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:12,630
我当时在用刀砍树枝...
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife...

1149
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:14,350
不小心把自己割伤了
and I cut myself by accident

1150
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:17,730
你今天看起来很英俊 你剪头发了吗
You look handsome today, did you get you haircut?

1151
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,110
谢谢 没有 我没有剪头发
Thank you, no, I didn't get my haircut

1152
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:22,230
我今天是要去剪头发
I'm going to get my haircut today

1153
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:24,270

Oh, thank you so much, I'm so hungry, I'll eat it right away

1155
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:30,820
- 这个大号手电筒 - 抱歉
- It's a big flashlight - Oh, I'm sorry

1156
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,920
这么大 我还以为是只兔子
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit

1157
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:36,550
这是我见过最大的手电筒
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen

1158
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:40,430
你准备好今晚走了吗
Are you ready for tonight

01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,300
当然
Of course I am

1160

我想和你说点事...
I want to tell you something,..

1161
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,140
但你千万别生气
But please don't be angry

1162
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,820
好的 怎么了
Ok, what's wrong?

1163
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,330
我什么也看不见了
I can't see anything

1164
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,750
我瞎了
I'm blind

1165
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,350
你在说什么
What do you mean?

1166
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,600
我没必要向你隐瞒
There is no point to lying to you

1167
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,520
你迟早会发现的
You'll find out soon or later

1168
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,360
我们的首领在城里把我弄瞎了
Our leader blinded me in the city

1169
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:12,130
她肯定发现我们相爱了
She must've realised I love you, and you love me...

1170
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:15,760
并且打算一起逃到城里
and we're going to run away to the city together

01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:26,600
是的 完全看不见
No, not at all

1174
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:30,710
那为什么问我剪头发了没
And why you asked for my haircut?

1175
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:34,900
我刚才说那些...
I was just saying that...

1176
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,430
是为了 不让你发现我看不见
so you wouldn't realise I could't see

1177
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:43,260
对不起
I'm sorry

1178
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:47,770
别哭 哭会让眼睛更疼的
Don't cry, crying will make our eyes hurt more

1179
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,670
我们会想办法解决的
We'll find a way

1180

From the first time I saw her, I knew she was the one

1183
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,400
她微笑着凝视我的双眼
As she stared in my eyes and smiled

1184
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:34,840
她美丽动人的唇色
And her lips were the colour of the roses

1185
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:39,090
宛若河边的玫瑰 娇艳而狂野
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

1186
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:45,860
你喜欢浆果吗 蓝莓或者黑莓
